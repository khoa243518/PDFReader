00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,600
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,878
 Annie fancies Nick

4
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,039
 but Nick fancies Bridget

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,519
 who fancies Hector.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 But guess what. Hector fancies Annie.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
 How are they going to solve their problems?

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
 More money! It's my lucky day.

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,318
 Now, where was I?

11
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,319
 99, 100.

12
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,719
 Good, that's done.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 Now the cushions.

14
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,519
 In my special order,

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
 orange, pink, purple...

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,358
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Hector.

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,959
 Red.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,999
 Hi, Annie.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,558
 -  I'm just...
 -  No!

20
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,398
 Bridget, no!

21
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,238
 It's OK, Bridget, you didn't see it.

22
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,878
 You didn't see it!

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,759
 What are you wearing? Take it off!

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,398
 What?

25
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,399
 Your shirt. It's that colour.

26
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,958
 Take it off.

27
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
 This shirt? What is wrong with the colour?
 What's wrong with yell...

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 Don't say it! Don't say that colour.

29
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,159
 Just take it off

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
 and throw it out.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 OK, OK.

32
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,278
 Done?

33
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,679
 Done.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 Bridget must not see anybody
 wearing that colour.

35
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,678
 Why?

36
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,679
 Because that colour...

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,718
 is very unlucky for me

38
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 and today is Lotto day!

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,358
 Lotto day. What...

40
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,359
 The lottery.

41
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,519
 I pick five numbers.

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
 My numbers are: 66, 11, 89,

43
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,439
 18 and 69.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 If my numbers are the same
 as the lottery numbers on television,

45
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,598
 I win millions!

46
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,599
 I've never heard of it.

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,919
 Bridget gets very excited.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 But I know how to keep calm.

49
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,239
 Yoga.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 So, there we are, Hector.

51
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,078
 Great. I am going shopping.

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,799
 -  Do you need anything?
 -  Yes.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 Could you get my dress
 from the dry- cleaner's, please?

54
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,198
 Dry- cleaner's? OK.

55
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,199
 The blue ticket is on the board.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,198
 Got it.

57
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,199
 See you later, Bridget.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,118
 -  Hector!
 -  Hi, Nick.

59
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,119
 I've just been to see Bridget.

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,039
 Yes, I can see.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,678
 Anyway, where are you going?

62
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,679
 I am going shopping.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,279
 Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 Come in here. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,238
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

66
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,159
 Pen, pen, I need a...

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 Pen. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7. Paper.

68
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,439
 Paper! 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 -  Thanks, Hector.
 -  What is it?

70
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,599
 Today I met a girl called Emily.

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 She is very beautiful.

72
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,559
 Long, blonde hair,

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,639
 -  big...
 -  Yes?

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,399
 ..blue eyes.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
 And she is crazy about me.

76
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,438
 Where did you meet her?

77
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,439
 She was in her sports car.

78
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,958
 At the traffic lights.

79
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,959
 I asked her for a lift, she said no.

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 But she shouted her phone number.

81
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,039
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

82
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,639
 I see.

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,118
 Hey!

84
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,119
 Maybe she has a friend or a sister.

85
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,198
 Wow, yeah!

86
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,199
 Let's go out. Today...is my lucky day.

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 Now it's time for the National Lottery.

88
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,759
 Good.

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,638
 Is this my lucky day?

90
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,639
 And the numbers are...

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,079
 Yes?

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 Hello, Mother.

93
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 Yes, well, I'm a bit busy.

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
 Can I call you...back?

95
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,398
 I've won!

96
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,398
 Mum, I've won!

97
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,399
 I must go.

98
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
 And those were this week's lucky numbers.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,718
 What is it?

100
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,719
 Annie...

101
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,719
 Bridget, I can't understand you!

102
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,439
 Annie,

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 I have won

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 the National Lottery!

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,038
 From now on,

106
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,039
 it will be a life of luxury.

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,479
 Designer clothes.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
 Exotic holidays.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,359
 Luxury homes.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
 The very best restaurants.

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 Mixing with the stars.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But of course I will give
 a lot of money to charity.

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,638
 No more work,

114
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,398
 no more bosses.

115
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,079
 In fact,

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 I'll call now and resign.

117
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,839
 Hello, this is Harry Bowler.

118
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,318
 Leave a message and I'll ring you back.

119
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,718
 Harry, it's Bridget.

120
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,639
 I resign!

121
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,678
 I quit!

122
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,959
 I'm off!

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,999
 Keep your job.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Goodbye.

125
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,599
 Oh, dear.

126
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,278
 From now on,

127
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,998
 no more bosses for Bridget.

128
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,998
 Bridget is the boss.

129
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,999
 Now, I'll just get my lucky little ticket.

130
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,919
 What is it?

131
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,919
 My lottery ticket...

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,479
 has disappeared.

133
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 What?

134
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
 But the dry- cleaning ticket is still there.

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 Hector has taken the wrong ticket.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 We'll go to the dry- cleaner's.

137
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 99, 100.

138
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,680
 Got it!

139
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,879
 My lottery ticket has disappeared.

140
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,960
 Hey, Nick, that waitress really likes you.

141
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
 Two girls in one day.

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Call me...Mr Irresistible!

143
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,679
 -  Hi, girls.
 -  Hi, Bridget.

144
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,039
 Your dress, Bridget. I forgot, sorry.

145
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,079
 How did you collect the cleaning

146
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
 when I had the ticket?

147
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,559
 No, Hector, darling.

148
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
 You have the wrong ticket.

149
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,758
 I have the wrong ticket?

150
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,439
 You have the wrong ticket.

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,758
 Now give it to me.

152
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,759
 Yes, I have it here, Bridget.

153
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,839
 You have got the ticket, Hector?

154
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 Yes, I have got the ticket, Bridget.

155
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 I have lost the ticket.

156
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,879
 You have lost the ticket, Hector?

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 I have lost the ticket, Bridget.

158
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,679
 You've lost the ticket, Hector.
 You can't have lost the ticket!

159
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,159
 Emily's number is on the back!

160
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,079
 Are you OK, Bridget?

161
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
 The ticket you took from the board

162
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 was not the dry- cleaning ticket.

163
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,359
 It was my lottery ticket.

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
 My winning lottery ticket.

165
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 I am a multimillionaire.

166
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 But with no ticket!

167
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,239
 And you,

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
 you can stop smiling
 because this is your fault too!

169
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,479
 OK!

170
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,439
 Nick, Hector,

171
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,798
 where have you been?

172
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,799
 Well, first we went to the CD shop.

173
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 No, no, no.

174
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 First we went to Leo's Cafe.

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,878
 Remember the waitress?

176
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,879
 Yeah! She was...

177
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
 Yes, and...

178
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 Then we went to the CD shop.

179
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 Then we went to Cool Man.

180
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,119
 And then we went to the motorbike showroom.

181
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Stop!

182
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 So, you are going back to look for it.

183
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,198
 Yes, ma'am!

184
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,199
 And don't come back until you've found it, OK?

185
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,118
 OK!

186
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,119
 The ticket must be claimed
 by ten o'clock tonight.

187
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,999
 Now get going.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Yeah.

189
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,999
 Understood?

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Understood!

191
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,879
 You can say that again!

192
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 OK, Hector.
 I hope you find the ticket. See you later.

193
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 Whoa! Where are you going?

194
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,759
 Well, I am going to the traffic lights.
 Emily might return.

195
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,199
 I can't ring her because her number
 is on the lost ticket, remember?

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Yeah, but what shall I do?

197
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,558
 Look for the ticket, of course.

198
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,559
 Yeah, but what shall I say?

199
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,159
 Well, you say...

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,558
 OK,

201
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,559
 I am the shopkeeper.

202
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,599
 You are you.

203
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 -  Great!
 -  OK.

204
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,119
 Good afternoon.

205
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,198
 Good afternoon.

206
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,199
 I have lost my ticket.

207
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,359
 What sort of ticket?

208
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 -  My winning lottery ticket.
 -  Your winning...

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,238
 Wait a moment.

210
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,239
 You can't say,
 'I have lost my winning lottery ticket.'

211
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,238
 Why not?

212
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:27,239
 Because if they know
 it is a winning lottery ticket,

213
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,199
 they will keep the money, they will hide it.

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 So you must be someone else.

215
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,959
 Who?

216
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 Someone who can search the rubbish bins.

217
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,198
 Search the rubbish bins?

218
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 That's it, a dustman.

219
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,118
 -  Dustman?
 -  Yeah!

220
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,119
 A dustman can search the rubbish bins.

221
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,398
 Great idea, Nick.

222
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,879
 Yeah, great idea, Nick.

223
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 Come on, you need to prepare.

224
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,799
 Emily's number is on the back!

225
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,400
 Now get going!

226
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,438
 -  Hello?
 -  Hello?

227
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
 -  Hector?
 -  Hello, Bridget.

228
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,198
 Have you found the ticket?

229
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,199
 No, not yet.

230
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,198
 Well, where's Nick?

231
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,199
 -  At the traffic lights.
 -  What?

232
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,279
 At the traffic lights?

233
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 Well, call me when you've found the ticket!

234
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 Bye...

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Leo: Today you will have a big surprise.

236
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,678
 -  Well?
 -  Well...

237
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,719
 -  Well?
 -  Well, what?

238
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,238
 Any luck?

239
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,518
 Yes and no.

240
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,838
 Yes and no?

241
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,839
 The bad news is, I didn't find her.

242
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,918
 -  Who?
 -  Emily.

243
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,479
 Emily who?

244
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
 Emily, the girl at the traffic lights.

245
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
 -  The good news is...
 -  Yes?

246
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:29,199
 I made £50 cleaning windscreens.

247
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,799
 Where's Hector?

248
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,919
 Where's my ticket?

249
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 Look at the time. It's ten to ten!

250
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
 Ten to ten? I haven't fed Charley.

251
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,199
 Where is Charley? I must find him.

252
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,279
 Charley was asleep on my bed this afternoon.

253
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,959
 Thanks, Nick.

254
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 There you are, Charley.

255
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,879
 Charley?

256
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
 What's this?

257
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,199
 Bridget!

258
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 Bridget, I found it! Your ticket!

259
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,038
 -  What?
 -  Where?

260
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,119
 On Nick's bed.

261
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 -  Who?
 -  On Nick's bed.

262
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,439
 -  Well, give it to me.
 -  No, give it to me.

263
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,959
 -  It's my ticket.
 -  Emily's number's on the back!

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 -  It's mine!
 -  Give it to me!

265
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,719
 It's OK, it's OK.

266
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 I'll stick it back together.

267
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
 Done!

268
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
 Thank you.

269
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
 Now I can claim my money.

270
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
 Hi, Hector.

271
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,839
 Poor Hector.

272
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
 I've just found the ticket on Nick's bed.
 Isn't it exciting?

273
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,879
 Yeah, great.

274
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 I can call Emily now.

275
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,598
 Great.

276
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,599
 -  When Bridget has finished.
 -  Great.

277
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,559
 Hello.

278
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 I'd like to claim my prize money, please.

279
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,958
 My numbers are:

280
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,959
 66, 11, 89,

281
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,959
 18 and 69.

282
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,479
 What?

283
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 What do you mean,
 they're not the winning numbers?

284
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 Well, what are your numbers, then?

285
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,079
 69, 81,

286
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,879
 68, 11 and 99?

287
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,479
 But how?

288
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 I know what happened.

289
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 Bridget, what were you doing
 while watching the lottery?

290
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 My yoga.

291
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,319
 Which position?

292
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,599
 This one.

293
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,519
 Exactly.

294
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 These are your numbers, but...

295
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
 ..this way.

296
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,318
 Bravo, Hector.

297
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,319
 It was nothing.

298
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 Emily's number.

299
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

300
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,799
 It's ringing.

301
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Hello.

302
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,199
 Is Emily there?

303
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,278
 No?

304
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,278
 Who are you?

305
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,279
 Jack's Taxis?

306
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 Emily, you tricked me!

307
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
 What an unlucky day.

308
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,719
 Well, it can't get any worse.

309
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:00,198
 Yes, it can.

310
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:02,838
 The phone call.

311
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,839
 My job.

312
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,039
 We must get that tape back.

313
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,318
 Now.

314
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,319
 And I know just the men

315
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,679
 for the job.

316
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,038
 Oh, no!

317
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,039
 Oh, yes!

318
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,719
 Nick, should we be here?

319
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,239
 It's OK. Bridget said it was OK.

320
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,078
 Look, there is the answerphone.

321
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,079
 Quick, get the tape!

322
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,759
 Security. Who's there?

323
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,238
 Next time in Extra...

324
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,239
 Bridget's twin comes to stay.

325
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Hector asks Annie on a date.

326
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,319
 And why is Bridget being so nice,

327
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,438
 or is she?

328
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:21,438
 or is she?

329
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:24,439
 or is she?
