1
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,319
 They have a visitor from Argentina

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,999
 who speaks only a little English.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 What the girls don't know, but Nick does,

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 is that Hector is very, very rich.

6
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,799
 Does Hector like Bridget?
 Does Bridget like Hector?

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,038
 And who does Nick like?

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,039
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,159
 Job...stuntman.

10
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,559
 Age...20. 20?

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,959
 No. 30, more mature.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
 Age...30.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 -  Where's the fire?
 -  It's the smoke detector.

14
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,759
 I know that! Where's the broom?

15
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,399
 Oh, good, it's stopped.

16
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,799
 I think this was the problem.

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 Anyone for very hard- boiled eggs?

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 -  Nick.
 -  Eh?

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 -  Are they your eggs?
 -  Eh?

20
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,239
 I thought so!
 What on earth are you doing? Are you crazy?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Ah. Are my eggs ready?

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
 Oh... Your eggs, Hector.

23
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,639
 Hector's eggs, Bridget.

24
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,959
 Is he crazy?

25
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:31,559
 Hector...the eggs are, erm, ruined.

26
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,079
 Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

27
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,759
 Thank you, Bridget.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 Hm. Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

29
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,799
 What are you doing on our computer anyway?

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,318
 Nothing.

31
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,319
 Let's just say, girls,

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,478
 one day you will say,

33
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,479
 'Brad Pitt... Urgh! Pah!

34
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,999
 'Johnny Depp... Urgh! Pah!

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 'Nick from next door... Vroom- vroom- vroom!

36
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,239
 ''The coolest stuntman in the world.''

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,558
 Oh, you a stuntman!

38
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,559
 Yep. I got the job on the Internet.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,080
 Well, nearly. I'm waiting for confirmation.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,158
 Oh, how exciting!

41
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,159
 The coolest stuntman in the world.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 On a moped, right?

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 On a Harley- Davidson, actually.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
 Films! Those stars! That money!

45
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,558
 Oh! Oh!

46
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,559
 Have you seen Carina's dress in the magazine?
 I'd love to have a dress like that.

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
 Mm, me too.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
 It would really suit me.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 -  How much is it?
 -  Oh, let's see. Erm...

50
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,358
 How much?

51
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,359
 Oh, I'm a student. It's too expensive for me.

52
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,159
 I've got a job and it's too expensive for me.

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 We need more money.

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,478
 Money?

55
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,479
 Bridget, Annie, I have something to tell you.

56
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,599
 Hector, don't. It's a secret.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
 ''The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.''

58
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,318
 Keep it a secret. Shh. Eh?

59
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,319
 Shh.

60
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,238
 What's a secret?

61
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:59,239
 You have been very kind.

62
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,519
 Yes, Hector.

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 I'm sure Bridget and Annie
 have a little money.

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,958
 Shh, Nick.

65
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,959
 So I want to...

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
 I want to give you some money.

67
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,238
 Yes?

68
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,239
 So, I am going...

69
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,878
 to look for a job.

70
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,879
 Oh... That's a great idea, Hector.

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,078
 Great!

72
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,079
 Yeah, we can look for a job on the Internet,
 can't we?

73
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,039
 -  OK, here we are. Job vacancies.
 -  Well, let's see.

74
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,679
 Oh. Well, there's a job in a launderette.

75
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,959
 Hector!

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,958
 No.

77
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,959
 And there's a job as a gardener.

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
 My plant!

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
 No.

80
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,439
 Erm, here's a job as a cook.

81
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,999
 No.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 Wait a minute. Look at this.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,438
 A waiter!

84
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,519
 What a great idea!

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 Yes! Ooh, I love good- looking waiters!

86
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,879
 Did you say good- looking? Here I am.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 What about Hector as a waiter?

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,198
 A waiter?

89
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,199
 Yeah. You know.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 Oh, but I don't know how.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
 Oh, don't worry. I will teach you.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Hello.

93
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,759
 Howard!

94
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,518
 How are you?

95
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
 (Laughs) Oh, thank you, Howard.

96
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,119
 Me? Dinner tonight?

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
 Seven o'clock at the Singing Parrot Cafe.

98
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,438
 OK, Howard.

99
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,439
 Bye, Howard.

100
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,399
 That was Howard.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,159
 No!

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,079
 He's invited me to dinner tonight

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 because he wants to...
 talk to me about a new job!

104
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,799
 Who is Howard?

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,559
 Bridget's boss.

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 He is so rich, he's so clever
 and he wants to see me!

107
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
 He might offer me a promotion.

108
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,959
 What shall I wear?

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 I have nothing to wear!

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 No! Wrong!

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,159
 Huh!

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,999
 So last season.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,958
 Bet Howard can't ride a motorbike.

114
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,158
 Nope.

115
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,159
 I hope he does give Bridget promotion...

116
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Although I have heard Howard has a nickname.

117
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,479
 (Bridget) What was I thinking?

118
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,678
 What?

119
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,679
 The Octopus.

120
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 The Octopus?

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Oh, The Octopus!

122
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:45,078
 Is he meeting her alone?

123
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,439
 Yes.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
 No, no!

125
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 -  Bridget needs help.
 -  We must stop her.

126
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,519
 I have an idea.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,118
 Why don't you eat here?

128
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,438
 No!

129
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,439
 Yes, then we can both talk to your boss
 about your new job.

130
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,638
 Here?

131
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,639
 No. No way.

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,838
 I could cook for you.

133
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
 Huh! Definitely not, no.

134
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,159
 And I could be your waiter.

135
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,918
 N...

136
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,919
 I want to be your waiter.

137
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,439
 Yeah, OK, then, but be serious.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 Don't worry,
 we will help you get your promotion.

139
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,879
 Leave it to us.

140
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,759
 I am going...

141
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,919
 to look for a job.

142
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,559
 My plant!

143
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,639
 Hm.

144
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,958
 A waiter?

145
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,959
 Yeah. You know.

146
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,758
 OK, Hector,

147
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,759
 you are the waiter so you must set the table.

148
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,919
 Yes, I have set the table

149
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,638
 but there is one problem.

150
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,718
 A problem?

151
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,719
 The table is too small.

152
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:22,319
 -  The table is too small?
 -  Yes. Look.

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
 Hector, this is set for 12 courses.

154
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,039
 Dinner at home is always like this.

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 Well, yes! You are a million...

156
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,919
 You are a millionaire.

157
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
 This is just a little dinner for Bridget's boss.

158
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,479
 -  OK?
 -  OK.

159
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 OK. I am the customer.

160
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,079
 Where would you like to sit?

161
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,359
 Hm.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 Here.

163
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,279
 Oh, I... Erm...

164
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,558
 The bill.

165
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,559
 Not yet. The menu first.

166
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
 Oh, sorry. Erm... The menu.

167
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,799
 Ah.

168
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 Forget the menu. What have you got today?

169
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 -  To eat?
 -  To eat.

170
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,199
 Today, as dish of the day,

171
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,799
 I have a delicious hot cat.

172
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 -  A hot cat?
 -  Mm- hm.

173
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,199
 That's a hot dog.

174
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 Ah! Hot cat, hot dog!

175
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,719
 Cat...hot...dog...

176
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 Oh, no!

177
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,239
 Oh, how's it going?

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
 Great! Nick is a good teacher.

179
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:19,439
 -  Let's see.
 -  Uh- uh. Hector's Cafe is now closed.

180
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,679
 Oh!

181
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
 I'll get it.

182
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 Delivery, Miss Evans and Miss Taylor.

183
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,599
 Thank you.

184
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 Oh! Bridget, look!

185
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 ''For lovely Annie from H.''

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,040
 ''For beautiful Bridget from H.''

187
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,680
 -  Who's H?
 -  Oh, it must be Howard!

188
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 Ooh, what is it?

189
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 Oh, Bridget!

190
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,079
 Look, it's Carina's dress!

191
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,918
 But how did he guess?

192
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,919
 Oh, he's a clever man!

193
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,479
 Anyway, it's not Carina's dress now,
 it's Bridget's dress!

194
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:15,239
 Oh, thank you, Howard!

195
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,359
 Oh, Bridget, isn't your boss kind?

196
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,399
 But why did he buy me one?

197
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
 Oh, I've told him all about you.

198
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 Me? Dinner tonight?

199
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,839
 He's so clever and he wants to see me!

200
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,319
 Oh, thank you, Howard.

201
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,959
 -  The Octopus!
 -  Ugh!

202
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,759
 We will help you get your promotion.

203
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,078
 Wow!

204
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,798
 OK, Nick?

205
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
 Yeah. Hot. The soup, hot.

206
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,239
 Uh- uh- uh- uh- uh. The soup is hot.

207
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:06,239
 Thank you, Hector.

208
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,479
 He's here.

209
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,199
 -  Good evening, Howard.
 -  Ah, Bridget, my princess!

210
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,159
 Please come in.

211
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,160
 Bridget, you look divine.

212
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,479
 Oh, this must be Annie.
 Are you sisters? Such beauty!

213
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,159
 The dresses are exquisite.

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
 Oh...

215
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,679
 Thank you.

216
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 -  Thank you.
 -  Don't thank me. It's a privilege.

217
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,639
 Oh, and this, of course, is Nick.

218
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,079
 Hi.

219
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
 And this is Hector. He's from Argentina.

220
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,399
 -  Hello.
 -  Argentina?

221
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,839
 -  Do you have a cow?
 -  Two million.

222
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 -  What?
 -  My parents own two million cows.

223
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,639
 Er, yes, thank you, Hector.

224
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 -  Hector's English is a little...
 -  Weird.

225
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,599
 Never mind, Hector.

226
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,679
 -  So, Bridget...
 -  Ooh!

227
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 What a beautiful apartment for a beautiful lady.

228
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,239
 Dinner is served.

229
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,519
 Hector, go on.

230
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,440
 Today we have sick pea soup.

231
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
 Mm. Sick pea soup. My favourite!

232
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,119
 Chickpea. Chickpea.

233
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
 Er...chickpea soup.

234
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,239
 This guy is great.
 Where did you find him?

235
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 Sick pea soup!

236
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:21,439
 Mind you, it does look like...bleurgh!

237
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
 Sorry, Nick.

238
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,359
 Main course. Teeth casserole.

239
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,278
 Teeth casserole?

240
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,158
 Beef. Beef.

241
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,159
 Sorry. Beef casserole.

242
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 I bet the beef is as hard as teeth.
 A dinner with bite!

243
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,599
 Oh! Sorry, Nick.

244
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,239
 So, Bridget, you would like a better job?

245
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,879
 Well, Howard, I...

246
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,678
 Are you willing to work harder, huh?

247
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,679
 Agh!

248
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,638
 You stupid idiot!

249
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,639
 Sorry, er...

250
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,519
 And, Bridget, with your good looks...

251
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 What a creep.

252
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 Hey! It's cold!

253
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 Hector! I want hot coffee.

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He wants hot coffee.

255
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,119
 Then he will have hot coffee.

256
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 So, by the age of 20

257
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,839
 I had 50 people working for me.

258
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,199
 Fascinating.

259
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 My father said,

260
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,719
 ''If you want more money, you must work hard.''

261
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 Hey! You have poisoned me!

262
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,119
 You fool! You stupid boy!

263
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,918
 Stupid?

264
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,919
 Don't you dare
 talk to my friend Hector like that!

265
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,840
 Oh, what is he?
 Is your boyfriend or something?

266
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 He is...

267
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:45,479
 a kind and clever and lovely man,

268
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 which is something that you will never, ever be.

269
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,239
 So you can keep your job, you creep!

270
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:58,479
 -  And we'll send you back the dresses.
 -  What dresses?

271
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,879
 Oh, these dresses,
 the ones you bought Annie and me.

272
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,718
 I did not buy those dresses.

273
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,719
 I would not spend money on you! Ha!

274
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,878
 Goodbye, Howard.

275
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,879
 You've lost your job.

276
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,359
 Well, too late. I quit!

277
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
 Howard said he did not buy the dresses.

278
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,558
 So who did?

279
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,559
 If H isn't for Howard...

280
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,959
 Then H is for Hector!

281
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,959
 You? But why did you buy the dresses?

282
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,679
 To say thank you.

283
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
 But they're so expensive.
 Where did you get the money?

284
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
 I...found it.

285
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,319
 Well, these expensive dresses
 must go back to the shop.

286
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
 Yes, they must.

287
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,278
 But not until tomorrow.

288
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,918
 That's right! Let's go clubbing!

289
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,919
 Come on, Nick, Hector!

290
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
 See you later, boys!

291
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,239
 Hector, you are a true, true friend.

292
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,278
 Money is not everything.

293
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,279
 So, what did you buy me?

294
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,879
 What do you think?

295
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,319
 I love you. I love you.

296
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,359
 Hm. One moment.

297
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 You didn't buy me a bike.
 You didn't buy me a bike.

298
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,518
 You didn't buy me a bike.

299
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,519
 OK?

300
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 Thanks, Hector. It's really, really...

301
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,679
 It's OK, Nick.

302
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,759
 Hop on. I'll give you a lift.

303
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,398
 Hey...

304
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:32,399
 So do you still want to be a waiter?

305
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,799
 No, I want to be like you, Nick. A stuntman!

306
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,759
 Aaagh!

307
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,479
 Next time in Extra...

308
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,919
 Nick gets a job on TV

309
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 Annie loves watching TV

310
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,079
 And why does Hector want to learn to cook?

311
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,439
 And why does Hector want to learn to cook?
