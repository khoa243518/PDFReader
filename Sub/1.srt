00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,599
 They have a neighbour, Nick.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,358
 Nick fancies Bridget.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,359
 But Annie fancies Nick.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 That's the way it is
 until Bridget gets a letter from Argentina.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Is he stupid?

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 I told you...

9
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,919
 Sorry. B.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
 Yes, John?

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 Yes, I got the cards
 and the flowers and the chocolates.

12
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,799
 Yes. And I got the cushion as well.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,038
 But it's finished. Sorry.

14
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,959
 But please don't leave me.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,399
 -  Don't cry.
 -  I love you so much.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,238
 Goodbye.

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
 Oh, and happy birthday.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 Ah, men!

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 Come on, Charley. Come on.

20
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 Post, Bridget. Charley and I have the post,
 haven't we, Charley?

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,439
 Give me the post, Charley.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 Give me the post, Charley.

23
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,919
 Drop it, Charley.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Oh, good boy!

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 What's this?

27
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,959
 A parcel for you, Bridget.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 Good. What is it?

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 Oh, it's from Mother.

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,919
 'Bridget darling, this arrived for you
 and I made you this.

31
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,399
 'Love, Mummy.'

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
 Oh, very you, Bridget.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,878
 Mother!

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,879
 Ooh, this is from Argentina.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,558
 Argentina? Who from? What does it say?

36
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,559
 Erm, it says, 'Hello, do you remember me?'

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
 No.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 'Seven years ago we was penpals.

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
 'We was...' We were penpals.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
 Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's Hector.

41
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,078
 Who's Hector?

42
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
 He was my penpal seven years ago.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
 Oh.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,598
 'I speak English good now...'

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,599
 I speak English good.
 I speak English well now...

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,278
 '..and I am coming to England.'

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,279
 Ooh, Latin Americans!

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 'I would like to sleep with you.'

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
 'Do you have a bed for me?'

50
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,039
 Oh, he wants to stay here.

51
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,919
 But, erm, what about the rules?

52
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,919
 Ooh, a Latin American here.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,919
 Ooh, like Ricky Martin!

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 -  Tall, handsome...
 -  Rich.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
 So, erm, when is he coming?

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 Oh, erm, let me see. It says...November 5th.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 Oh, November 5th. But that's...

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 Today!

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,798
 Oh, it's you, Nick.

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,558
 Hi, babes!

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,559
 -  Hello, Nick. How are you?
 -  Great.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,758
 Nice muscles.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,759
 -  Here's your milk.
 -  Our milk?

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 You mean our milk
 you borrowed three weeks ago.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,319
 Oh, thanks, Nick.

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 I forget nothing!

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,119
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,319
 -  Uh- huh?
 -  I said, 'Would you like a drink, Nick?'

70
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,359
 Oh! Sorry.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 No, thanks.

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, erm, Bridget's friend is coming.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 -  Oh, yeah?
 -  Uh- huh. From Argentina.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,799
 Wow! From Argentina!

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,039
 -  What's she like?
 -  She is a he.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 -  Huh?
 -  Not a girl, a boy.

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
 Tough guy, eh?

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Why don't I show you how to do it properly?

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
 Nick, I've told you before,
 nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

80
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,359
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 If you touch my bike again, you are out.
 O- U- T, out. Clear?

82
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,239
 What?

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 I said...

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,878
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,358
 You mean, 'I am called Hector.'

87
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,398
 You are called Hector?

88
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,078
 Oh, no, no, no. I am called Annie.

89
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,638
 I am called Annie.

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,639
 No. She means, 'I am called Hector.
 I am from Argentina.'

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
 You are from Argentina?

92
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
 Come in.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Hello.

94
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,079
 -  Hi, babes!
 -  Hello, Nick.

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
 I forget nothing.

96
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
 Nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 My cars.

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,919
 You play with cars?

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Yes. You play...no.

102
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,359
 I play with cars.

103
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,638
 He plays with cars.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,639
 I read. I love the library.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,999
 Fascinating.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We go to the library too, don't we, Bridget?

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
 Yes, it's great.

108
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,759
 Good.

109
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,799
 I live here.

110
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
 You live in a museum, full of old things?

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 Old things? Yes, I have lots of old things.

112
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,439
 I live in a museum.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
 OK, I live in a museum.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Well, thank you, Hector.
 And now we'll show you the flat.

115
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
 This is the bedroom.

116
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,759
 Thank you.

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,119
 Who- hey!

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,479
 Where do you sleep?

119
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 Er, no, you don't understand.
 We only have one bedroom.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
 One? I have 20.

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,518
 20?

122
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
 Yes, he lives in a museum, with 20 bedrooms.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Oh! Very funny, 20 bedrooms.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 Well, you can sleep here.

125
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,799
 Oh, thank you.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 -  Oh, no, no, no, Hector.
 -  Uh?

127
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
 It's a bed.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,638
 A bed? Oh, wow...

129
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,598
 Oh...

130
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,358
 -  Here's a cushion.
 -  Oh, thank you.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,359
 Oh, this of course is the TV.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 But just relax. I must go to the bathroom.

133
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,119
 Psst! Annie! Bathroom!

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 Now!

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,159
 Oh, my goodness. What are we going to do?

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,278
 He plays with toy cars.

137
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
 He is not a sexy Argentinian.

138
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,478
 But he is sweet.

139
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,479
 And he is polite.

140
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,198
 But those clothes!

141
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,199
 He is so old- fashioned.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 He must go.

143
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,239
 Room service.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,199
 Hello. Who are you?

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 -  Oh. You are quick. Good.
 -  Eh?

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 -  My luggage is downstairs.
 -  What?

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,199
 -  Bring it up, please.
 -  What are you doing?

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,879
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

149
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,758
 The butler?

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,759
 I am Nick. I live next door.

151
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,598
 I am Hector.

152
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,599
 Oh, Hector, from Argentina.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Yes, from Argentina.

154
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,079
 Where are the girls?

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,679
 -  The girls?
 -  Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,399
 Oh, they live here.

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Yeah, I know. Where's Bridget?
 Does she know you are here?

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 Bridget, she gave me this.

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 Hello, Nick. Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,638
 Yeah, I know.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,438
 -  Isn't he wonderful?
 -  Wonderful.

162
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,918
 -  Are you hungry?
 -  Uh?

163
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,919
 We'll buy your lunch.
 What would you like to eat?

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 -  Fish and chips?
 -  Oh, fish and ships!

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 Erm, Nick, Hector, make friends?

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 Nick, teach Hector some English.

167
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,638
 Yeah, OK.

168
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 I'll teach Hector some English.

169
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,359
 Oh, you are quick. Good.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

171
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,999
 The butler?

172
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 She gave me this.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 I'll teach Hector some English.

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 OK...this is the oven.

175
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,198
 This is the oven.

176
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

177
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So you say, 'Annie, the dog is in the oven.'

179
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
 Annie, the dog is in the oven.

180
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,718
 Great! Now Bridget.

181
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,719
 -  Oh. Oh, dear.
 -  Huh?

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Well, Bridget likes strong men,
 especially strong legs.

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,318
 I am strong.

184
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,319
 Yeah? Can you cycle 50 kilometres?

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,078
 -  Yes.
 -  No way.

186
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,798
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, go on, then, show me.

187
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,799
 Yes, look.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 Adios, amigo.

189
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
 Ah. Bridget, Annie, lunch.

190
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,678
 Fish and chips.

191
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,679
 Yes, lunch, Hector.

192
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
 Look, Bridget, 50 kilometres.

193
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 What?

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,359
 Hi. Everything OK?

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 Great!

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I am... How do you say? Erm...

198
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,039
 -  Dead.
 -  Hot.

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,999
 Hot. Yeah, I am hot. I need a...

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 -  Shower.
 -  Yeah, I need a shower.

201
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,119
 -  Be my guest.
 -  Oh, thank you.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,519
 Right, that's it. He must go.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,238
 Why? He is so nice.

204
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,759
 He used my bike.

205
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 Yeah, and he said that the dog was in the oven.
 What a horrible joke.

206
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Where is Charley? Charley!

207
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 -  What a bad, bad boy.
 -  He must go.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 -  Can he stay with you, Nick?
 -  Uh- uh. Sorry, ladies.

209
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 -  Oh, please, Nick. You have a spare room.
 -  No way. Not my problem.

210
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,039
 -  He must go now.
 -  But he's in the shower.

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 I don't care.

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
 Hector, please come out,
 we want to talk to you.

213
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 I like fish and chips, I...

214
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,998
 Hector, please come out, we want to talk to you.

215
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,358
 OK, one moment, please.

216
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,198
 I like fish and chips...

217
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,199
 Yes, you want me?

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 -  We think...
 -  We...

219
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 We...we have a problem.

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
 It's like this.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 Go on, then, tell him.

222
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,518
 Yes, Bridget?

223
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,519
 Hector, the thing is...

224
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,199
 Stay there. I'll talk to him.

225
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,239
 Hector, can I have a word, please?

226
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Ricky Martin!

227
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Hector, is this you?

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 Yes, and my parents.

229
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 'The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.'

230
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,639
 Who are these?

231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 My...

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 -  Servants.
 -  Yeah, my servants.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
 -  Your cars?
 -  Yeah, my cars.

234
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Hector, you are rich.

235
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,238
 Why stay here?

236
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 I want friends. Good friends.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 People like you for your money?

238
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
 That's awful.

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Erm... Listen, keep it a secret.

240
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,359
 -  OK.
 -  OK.

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 Perhaps he could stay here.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 Yes. Poor boy.

243
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,439
 Hector, come and stay with me.
 I have two rooms.

244
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 -  Shut up, Nick.
 -  Hector will stay with us, won't you, Hector?

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Hector, come and...sit down.

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hector, please, call me Gigi.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
 Oh, Charley, there you are.

248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

249
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
 The oven?

250
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 Yes. Nick is a good English teacher.

251
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,239
 Yes, a very good English teacher.

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 -  I'd love to see your photos again.
 -  Oh, me too.

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Oh, your sweet toy cars!

254
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,718
 They are not toys.

255
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,719
 Today Hector arrives and it's Bonfire Night.

256
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,118
 Let's party!

257
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,119
 -  What sort of music do you like?
 -  Music?

258
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,399
 Yeah, music. You know, soul, funk, dance.

259
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 Watch me. Like this.

260
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
 Interesting.

261
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,759
 I dance...like this.

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 I'll get it. I'll get it.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,318
 Hello.

264
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,319
 Oh, yeah, that's great.

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 Sure. Come up.

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,398
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  The tarantula!

267
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,399
 -  Quick, hide, Hector.
 -  I'm off. I owe two weeks' rent.

268
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,398
 Next time in Extra...

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,238
 The flatmates go shopping for Hector.

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,238
 Hector goes shopping for the girls.

271
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,239
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

272
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,199
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?
