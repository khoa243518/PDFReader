00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,078
 They have a neighbour, Nick,

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,198
 who likes Bridget.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,919
 But Annie likes Nick.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 That is until Hector arrives from Argentina,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
 and Hector is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,639
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 Oh. Argentinian.

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,239
 Maybe...

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,839
 Hector, please,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 call me Gigi.

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 'Oh, Hector, call me Gigi.'

13
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,439
 -  A.
 -  Is Hector still asleep?

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Yep.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
 Hector, wakey- wakey.

16
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,799
 Come on. Rise and shine.

17
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 Sweet.

18
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,758
 Good morning.

19
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,198
 Oh, good morning.

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,838
 No, no, no. Good morning.

21
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,878
 -  Ah- ah- ah.
 -  Oh.

22
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,559
 Good morning.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,438
 Ah- ah- ah.

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,119
 No, Hector.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,078
 -  I have a cold.
 -  And so have I.

26
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,318
 Oh, you have a cold, Bridget.

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
 Yes, I have a cold.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
 Yes. We have a cold.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,919
 So let's begin again.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,678
 Good morning.

31
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,918
 Good morning.

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,159
 Oh, never mind.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 Hector, would you like some...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 new pyjamas?

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 Hector, please excuse me for a moment.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 Pssst. Annie. Bathroom.

37
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,679
 Now.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 -  Good morning.
 -  Good morning.

39
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,839
 Is it fancy dress?

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,878
 Fancy dress?

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,318
 Yes.

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,519
 Oh. Nice.

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,158
 Hey.

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,199
 Nice car, eh?

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,679
 I have this car at home.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 Wow. You have this car at home?

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,079
 Girls must love you.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,038
 Girls?

49
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,039
 -  No.
 -  No?

50
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,719
 Hector, can I tell you something?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,679
 OK.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 The car looks good.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,878
 Yeah?

54
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,879
 So you must look good too.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,798
 -  I look good.
 -  No.

56
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 You don't look good.

57
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,879
 But I can help.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,398
 OK.

59
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
 OK.

60
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,679
 Yes.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 -  Hector's clothes are awful.
 -  They're so old- fashioned.

62
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,519
 I know. I'll take him shopping.

63
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,559
 But, Bridget, you are so busy.
 I'll take him shopping.

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,359
 -  No, it's all right, I'll take him shopping.
 -  It's no problem, I'll take him.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 I said I'll take him shopping!

66
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,959
 You need...

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,638
 You need a...

68
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Well, hi, babe.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,118
 -  Oh, it's you, Nick.
 -  Oh, hi, Nick.

70
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,119
 Hector has asked me what clothes to wear.

71
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,839
 Yeah, right.

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 You need a look

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
 like on a fast bike.

74
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,198
 No, no, no, Hector, don't listen to Nick.

75
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,118
 -  Listen to me.
 -  OK.

76
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,119
 You need a designer look.

77
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,959
 No, no, no, Hector, that's not for you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,398
 You need,

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,399
 you need...a cowboy look.

80
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,919
 -  No, no. A leather jacket.
 -  A bandanna and a vest.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,918
 A denim shirt.

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,158
 -  A motorbike.
 -  Designer.

83
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,478
 Cowboy.

84
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,919
 Stop.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
 OK.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,598
 I will go shopping.

87
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,798
 -  What?
 -  On your own?

88
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,799
 But...you need us.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,678
 How? What will you say?

90
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,238
 Er...

91
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,679
 It's OK. Leave it to me.

92
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 I am the shopkeeper, you are the customer.

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,158
 -  Uh?
 -  This is a shop.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,159
 -  I sell, you buy.
 -  Oh, OK.

95
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,519
 Ding- dong.

96
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,239
 Good morning.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,038
 Good morning.

98
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,079
 Can I help you?

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 Yes. I...

100
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,198
 I would like...

101
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,199
 Oh. I would like...

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
 a jacket, please.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,199
 Trousers.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,158
 I would like a pair of trousers, please.

105
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,159
 Oh, I would like a pair of trousers, please.

106
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,038
 And...

107
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,438
 a shirt.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,998
 No.

109
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,558
 Shoes.

110
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,559
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

111
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,759
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

112
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,719
 And a cat for my head.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I think you mean a hat.

114
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,159
 This is a cat.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,078
 A cat? A cat for my head.

116
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,079
 A cat for my head!

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,119
 Hector. Come shopping with me.

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,519
 -  Or me.
 -  No, me.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 -  He's my pen friend.
 -  All right.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,239
 I will go to the shoe shop.

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,438
 And I will go to the clothes shop.

123
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,038
 No, I'll go to the clothes shop.

124
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,039
 OK. I'll just buy the shirt.

125
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,118
 I'll buy the trousers.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,118
 Good.

127
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,318
 Good.

128
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,319
 Right. Let's go.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
 Oh, no. I completely forgot.

130
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
 We need eggs, lemons and dog food.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
 Oh, it's all right. I'll do it online later.

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 Oh, well done, Hector.

134
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,119
 Bye, Hector. Oh, and don't answer the phone.
 It might be the tarantula.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,918
 OK.

136
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,758
 Bye, Hector. Be good.

137
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,198
 And if you can't be good, be careful.

138
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,199
 -  Huh?
 -  Never mind.

139
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,599
 ..new pyjamas.

140
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,039
 I'll take him shopping.

141
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,199
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 You need a cowboy look.

143
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,279
 You need a look like on a fast bike.

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
 Good morning, sir.

145
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,958
 I would like...

146
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,959
 a cat for my head!

147
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,199
 A cat...

148
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Oh. Room service.

149
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,239
 Hello. I would like an egg for my head.

150
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,359
 Lemons for my head!

151
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,279
 -  Dog food for my head!
 -  Who's that?

152
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,999
 The tarantula!

153
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,559
 I said, 'Who's that?'

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,278
 -  Hello?
 -  Where's Bridget?

155
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,279
 Er... Where is Bridget?

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
 Me.

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,919
 I am Bridget.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,759
 I don't believe you.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Yes, I have a cold.

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,399
 -  Atchoo! Atchoo!
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Oh, thank you. Atchoo!

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,479
 Charley!

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,679
 Is that a dog?

164
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 No, no, it's not a dog, it's a...

165
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,239
 Annie. Yes.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Annie has a cold also.

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,598
 Oh, poor Annie.

168
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,039
 Thank you. Atchoo. Now goodbye.

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 Atchoo! Atchoo!

170
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,278
 Ole.

171
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,039
 I am Hector.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,919
 I speak English.

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.

174
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,119
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

175
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,518
 Oh, hi. Good afternoon, Annie.

176
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,359
 Good afternoon, Hector.

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,078
 I bought this for you.

178
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,478
 What is it?

179
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,159
 Try it on.

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,758
 Try...

181
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,918
 it...

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,278
 on.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,599
 Try...

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
 it...

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,718
 on.

186
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,719
 Oh. Try it on.

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,559
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In the bathroom.

188
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,558
 Good. I'll give this to him.

189
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 -  It's OK, I'll give it to him.
 -  No, it's all right.

190
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
 Hector.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,359
 Hector.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 I've got something for you.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,758
 Oh. OK.

194
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,759
 Come in.

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
 Spoilsport.

196
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Hector?

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,998
 Hector?

198
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,999
 -  Hello?
 -  Here are your clothes.

199
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,638
 You will look so cool.

200
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 -  Cool?
 -  Cool.

201
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,039
 Cool.

202
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,479
 Nice melons.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,079
 Melons? Who are those from?

204
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 I think Hector has been shopping online.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 I'm really thirsty. I need a drink.

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
 -  But we don't need any melons.
 -  Well, he did try.

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,478
 And he bought some eggs.

208
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,318
 Yeah.

209
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,319
 Just a few.

210
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,239
 Nice melons.

211
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 Just a few.

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Thank you.

213
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,398
 Try...

214
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,439
 it...

215
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 on.

216
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 I've got something for you.

217
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,839
 So how did Hector do the shopping?

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 Hector ordered ten melons
 instead of ten lemons.

219
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,679
 Oh, an easy mistake. He did try.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,319
 Yes, he did try.

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,039
 -  What about the eggs?
 -  OK. Eggs.

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,558
 You buy a dozen eggs, yeah?

223
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,599
 Yep. A dozen is ten.

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,559
 A dozen is 12, stupid.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,638
 I know.

226
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
 Well, Hector has put the number 12 here.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,118
 Well, that's OK. That's one box.

228
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,119
 No. He ordered 12 boxes.

229
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,159
 144.

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,118
 Now...dog food.

231
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,039
 I can't wait.

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
 OK. I'm ready.

233
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,479
 -  We're ready.
 -  Enter.

234
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,239
 Do you like it?

235
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,959
 Well?

236
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,679
 Er... I like the shirt.

237
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,239
 -  I like the sarong.
 -  I like the shoes.

238
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,278
 So...

239
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,799
 am I cool?

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,919
 Erm...

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
 No.

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,439
 I'm not cool.

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 Er...no.

244
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,679
 So...I will go shopping.

245
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,959
 Here we go again. Hector.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 You can't go out there on your own.
 You went shopping on the Internet.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,398
 Yes.

248
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Your ordered melons instead of lemons
 and too many eggs.

249
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,519
 -  Have you ever been to a supermarket?
 -  No.

250
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 My...

251
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,078
 Who are these?

252
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,079
 My...

253
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,239
 -  Servants?
 -  Yeah. My servants.

254
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,439
 -  Servants. Now I understand.
 -  Come on, Hector.

255
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 -  I will teach you how to shop, Hector.
 -  Till you drop.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,319
 Bridget and I will be the shopkeepers.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 And you are our customer.

258
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,559
 OK.

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,438
 -  Good afternoon.
 -  Good afternoon.

260
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,439
 Can I help you, sir?

261
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,319
 What would you like to buy?

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Oh. I would like some...

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,478
 Clothes.

264
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,479
 Yes. I would like some clothes, please.

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,919
 What size?

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,079
 What erm, erm...

267
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,518
 size?

268
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,518
 I don't know.

269
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
 I'll have to measure you, then.

270
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,279
 Arms up, please.

271
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,679
 Arms up, please.

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 Arms up, please.

273
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,999
 Chest.

274
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,758
 112 centimetres.

275
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,759
 Chest, 112 centimetres.

276
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:45,199
 And waist.

277
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,599
 82 centimetres.

278
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,678
 Waist.

279
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,518
 82 centimetres.

280
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,358
 And leg.

281
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,679
 -  I'll do that!
 -  No, it's OK.

282
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 I shall do that.

283
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,918
 Eight...

284
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,118
 y- seven centimetres.

285
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,919
 Now, do you like these trousers?

286
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,759
 Do you like this shirt?

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,198
 Yes.

288
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,199
 Good. That's erm...

289
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,999
 £5,000, please.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,678
 OK.

291
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,719
 No, no, no, Hector.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
 £5,000 is...

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,439
 is...

294
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,318
 8,000 dollars.

295
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,999
 Yeah.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's too much. It's too expensive.

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,439
 Not for Hector.

298
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,839
 So...

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I am ready to go shopping.

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,119
 -  Good luck.
 -  Yeah. Good luck.

301
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 You'll need it.

302
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 Where's my lemon drink, Nick?

303
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,759
 Nick, are there any more tissues?

304
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 All right. I'm coming as fast as I can.

305
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
 OK.

306
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,439
 Oh. I feel awful.

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 Me too. Nothing will make me feel better.

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 Can you get that, please, Nick?

309
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,759
 Ah, it's only Hector.

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,198
 Well?

311
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,199
 Is it...cool?

312
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 Wow, man. Well done, you look great.

313
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,559
 I would like a shirt, please.

314
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Excellent. Oh, the clothes are super.

315
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 And a pair of trousers.

316
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,679
 Oh. You are clever, Hector.

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 And a pair of shoes, please.

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I have been shopping!

319
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
 Oh, I'll get it.

320
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,838
 Hello?

321
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,879
 -  It's me.
 -  Oh, hello.

322
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,839
 It's the tarantula.

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,278
 How are you?

324
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,718
 -  Fine, thank you.
 -  Oh, good, good.

325
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,478
 -  How's your cold?
 -  How's my cold?

326
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 -  Well, how do you know I have a cold?
 -  You told me this morning.

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,118
 Me.

328
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,119
 -  I am Bridget.
 -  I don't believe you.

329
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,559
 Yes. I have a cold.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 -  Thank you.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

331
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,798
 Yes. Silly me.

332
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,598
 I told you this morning.

333
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,599
 Why are 400 tins of dog food here for Annie?

334
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,799
 Pardon?

335
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,839
 I don't know.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,398
 -  How strange.
 -  400 tins!

337
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,399
 Yes, that's a lot of tins. I really don't know.

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 -  Can you ask Annie?
 -  Yes, I'll ask Annie.

339
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Goodbye.

340
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,879
 The tarantula said

341
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 why are 400 tins of dog food downstairs?

342
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 400 tins?

343
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,119
 Hector...

344
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,639
 Next time in Extra...

345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
 Annie goes dating on the Internet,

346
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,839
 and so do Nick and Hector.

347
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

348
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
 But do they like their dates?
