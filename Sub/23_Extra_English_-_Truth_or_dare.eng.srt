1
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,279
 This is the story of Bridget
 and Annie, who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,439
 and the boys next door -  Nick, and
 his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,239
 Bridget wants to marry a millionaire.

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,119
 Nick wants to be a millionaire.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,839
 Hector is a millionaire.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,798
 But Annie doesn't really care.

7
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,799
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,160
 He's been gone for ages.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,358
 Do you think he did it?

10
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,359
 Nah. I bet he didn't dare.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
 Well, there you go.

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
 One bottle of milk...

13
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,239
 one tin of tuna...

14
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,078
 Bravo, Nick!

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,319
 Come on, Bridget, your turn.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
 Do your dare.

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,119
 Bernard, I love you!

18
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,359
 You're the one for me.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
 Please, let's run away together.

20
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,718
 All right, Bernard?

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,719
 Hello, Bernard. OK?

22
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,519
 Let's do it again.
 Tell the truth, or do a dare.

23
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,599
 Now, do you want to tell the truth?

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
 Well, then you have to do a dare.

25
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,959
 Yeah, but what dare?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,198
 I know.

27
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,199
 I dare you to...kiss Nick.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,958
 Truth or dare?

29
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,079
 A dare.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
 OK, I dare you to...

31
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,479
 copy someone in this room.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 Someone in this room, eh?

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
 Right, my turn.

34
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,039
 A dare.
 I dare myself to kiss Bridget.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
 Not another dare! Why not the truth?

36
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,038
 -  The truth?
 -  Yes.

37
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,559
 Nobody wants to speak the truth.

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 I dare you... I dare all of you
 to speak the truth.

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,278
 OK, let's speak the truth.

40
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,279
 -  For a whole day.
 -  Tomorrow.

41
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,879
 -  No lies?
 -  No lies.

42
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,838
 And the winner...

43
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,839
 we buy the winner dinner for two
 at The Ivy restaurant!

44
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,839
 24 hours of truth.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You will tell the truth, the whole
 truth and nothing but the truth.

46
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,998
 Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.

47
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,999
 Mr P is waiting for you
 at your usual table.

48
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,439
 The whole truth
 and nothing but the truth.

49
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 The truth.

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 -  What's wrong with you?
 -  Nothing at all really.

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 Is there no food in your apartment?

52
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,279
 The truth, the whole truth...

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 The thing is, Annie...
 The truth is...

54
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
 on Thursdays, I never go shopping,
 I just take your food.

55
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 What? You mean that...?

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,959
 Handy.

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,999
 Hello? What?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 An audition? A commercial? When?

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
 I've got to go.

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,959
 Hi, Nick.

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 Hi, Hector. What are you doing?

62
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,599
 I'm writing things
 I don't like about Annie.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,798
 What?

64
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,799
 Let's use the truth to make
 our relationship stronger.

65
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,319
 OK.

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 Go on, write
 things I don't like about Hector.

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
 OK. 'Things I don't like
 about Hector.'

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
 I behave like a big child?!

69
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,239
 I shout too much?

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
 See? You are doing it again.

71
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,679
 So, you don't like my carrot cake?

72
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 And you've never liked
 my carrot cake?

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,758
 -  No.
 -  But you always eat it.

74
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,519
 I didn't want to upset you.

75
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 Well, now I am cross. Very cross!

76
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,078
 See? You are shouting again.

77
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,839
 I do not shout too much!

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 Calm down, please, Annie.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I'm late, I'm late,
 I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,318
 Hello?

81
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,319
 John? No, I don't want to see you.
 Goodbye.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 An old boyfriend. How strange.

83
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,599
 So, Hector, if we're telling
 the truth, let me ask you...

84
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,878
 Yes?

85
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,879
 -  Do you fancy Bridget?
 -  No.

86
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 And before,
 have you ever fancied Bridget?

87
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,799
 Well...

88
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,039
 Out! Get out!

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But, Annie...

90
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 I hate the truth!

91
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 Annie, do I look fat
 in these trousers?

92
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,918
 Yes.

93
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,919
 To tell the truth, yes,
 you do look fat in those trousers.

94
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 I can't change clothes,
 I don't have time.

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 And don't forget -  one day of truth.

96
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,919
 You're the one for me.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Please, let's run away together.

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 I dare you... I dare all of you
 to speak the truth.

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,159
 Hello!

100
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 So, this is a commercial for yoghurt.

101
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,719
 That's right, Nick, Yupiyoghurts.

102
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,319
 Great!

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,919
 This is the most delicious yoghurt
 in the world.

104
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,398
 Wow, in the world.

105
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
 So, first, we want you to eat some.

106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 45 minutes late.

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,878
 I'm sorry, Eunice.

108
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,879
 What happened this time?
 A fire in the house?

109
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,439
 A burglar? A big monster?

110
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,719
 No. The bus...

111
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,919
 Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.

112
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 Mr P is waiting for you
 at your usual table.

113
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,879
 No. I'm late because I overslept.

114
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
 So, you overslept?

115
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,239
 Of course.
 You do need your beauty sleep.

116
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 Now, work!

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
 My bag. Where is it?

118
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,879
 Bridget, you know
 Channel 9 wants new talent?

119
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,599
 Have you found any?

120
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 Well, I have.

121
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,638
 A new presenter.

122
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,839
 Really? Who?

123
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 Me!

124
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
 Look.

125
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,319
 Hello, my darlings.

126
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,359
 What? What?

127
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
 Hello, my darlings.
 This is the beautiful Eunice,

128
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,519
 bringing you delight and wonder
 from Nannel Chine.

129
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,959
 From Channel 9.

130
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,959
 Stay tuned
 for all my special reports.

131
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 Well, what do you think?

132
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,479
 We want you to eat some
 and then say, 'Mm, delicious!'

133
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,879
 Mm, delicious.

134
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,078
 -  After I eat this?
 -  Yes.

135
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
 -  Do you have a problem with that?
 -  No. No problem at all.

136
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,439
 The truth.

137
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
 It's de...sgusting!

138
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,239
 It's terrible, it's horrible.

139
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,158
 -  Do I get the part?
 -  Next!

140
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,279
 Ridiculous?

141
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
 Ridiculous?!

142
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,119
 What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?

143
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,358
 Stupid yoghurt!

144
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,759
 So, you didn't get it then?

145
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
 -  Nah.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

146
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,799
 Well, at least I don't have
 to eat them again.

147
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,759
 Where's Hector?

148
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 Hector?

149
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,119
 Don't talk to me about Hector.

150
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,399
 So, where is she?

151
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,759
 -  Where is who?
 -  Bridget.

152
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 I got her message and here I am.

153
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,159
 -  You have got a date with Bridget.
 -  That's right.

154
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 This is a very, very strange day.

155
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,039
 Bridget's not in.

156
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 -  Here, have a yoghurt.
 -  Thanks.

157
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,960
 Handbag, handbag, handbag.

158
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 Eunice is an ugly,
 bad- tempered witch.

159
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
 My handbag.

160
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,559
 Oh, it's you.

161
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,479
 Hello?

162
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 Who? Kevin?

163
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,639
 Three years ago Kevin?

164
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 No, no, I don't!

165
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 Two old boyfriends - 
 first John, now Kevin.

166
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
 What a coincidence.

167
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,759
 Mm, delicious.

168
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 Mm, it's de...sgusting!

169
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,718
 Do I look fat in these trousers?

170
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,719
 Yes.

171
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
 What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?

172
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,759
 Kevin?

173
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 What a coincidence.

174
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 Hello, Bridget.

175
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,199
 How dare you call me a witch?

176
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,479
 'You are an ugly
 bad- tempered witch.'

177
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
 -  I didn't send that message.
 -  No? It's your number.

178
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
 My mobile, someone took my mobile.

179
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,519
 Good try.

180
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:14,199
 The truth. Did you send that message?

181
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,079
 No, no! Someone took my phone.

182
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 All right then,
 you didn't send the message.

183
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,399
 So, what do you think of me?

184
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 The truth?

185
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,120
 The truth, Eunice -  you're an ugly,
 bad- tempered witch.

186
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 You know, Bridget,
 honesty is a great quality.

187
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,678
 -  It is?
 -  It is.

188
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,679
 I hope honesty will help you...

189
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,919
 when you look for a new job!
 You're fired!

190
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,959
 Well, hooray for the truth.

191
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 Ziggy's coming later.
 Then we'll decide who's the winner.

192
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,598
 What a day!

193
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,318
 I need comfort food.

194
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,319
 The truth...the truth is,
 we were asking the wrong questions.

195
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,478
 Ask me what I think of your eyes.

196
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,479
 What do you think of my eyes?

197
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 I think you have the most beautiful
 eyes I have ever seen in my life.

198
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
 Really? Tell me more.

199
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
 I think you are
 the sweetest, kindest...

200
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 -  Oh, snuggly puppy!
 -  Oh, sugar plum!

201
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,359
 I feel sick.

202
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,319
 Hello?

203
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,479
 Oh, not again!

204
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Listen, Stuart, I finished with you
 because you have no personality,

205
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 no money...and no sense of humour.

206
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,559
 More old boyfriends.

207
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,239
 I don't understand it.

208
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,279
 At last.

209
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,880
 Oh, Bridget my fair

210
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,319
 -  Oh, Bridget my fair...
 -  Stop, stop.

211
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,039
 Stop!

212
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 Why are you doing this?

213
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,959
 -  But you told me to come.
 -  I told you to come?

214
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,518
 I got your text.

215
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,519
 Who is sending
 all these messages from my mobile?

216
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,399
 John? No, I don't want
 to see you! Goodbye.

217
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So, where is she.
 I got her message and here I am.

218
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
 ..call me a witch? You're fired!

219
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
 My bag? Handbag, handbag?

220
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,239
 Eunice is an ugly bad- tempered witch!

221
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,479
 Oh, it's you.

222
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,679
 It was you, wasn't it?

223
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,159
 I think Bridget should be the winner.

224
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 Yes, we'll pay for dinner for two
 at the Ivy.

225
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 Yes! I'm going to the Ivy!

226
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,878
 Eunice?

227
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,518
 So, what do you want?

228
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,519
 'Please come to my flat at 7pm.'

229
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,558
 Now, what do you want?

230
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,559
 I didn't text you. Ziggy stole
 my phone and sent those messages.

231
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,719
 Oh, lady of such beauty

232
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 -  I have never seen...
 -  Who's this?

233
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,479
 Lady of such beauty
 You shall be my queen

234
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:53,439
 Bridget, where did you find this man?

235
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,958
 He is perfect for Channel 9.

236
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,839
 He is?

237
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 Absolutely.
 He'll make a perfect weather man.

238
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,319
 Maybe you can have your job back.

239
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
 Now, come and talk
 about your contract.

240
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,799
 Weird.

241
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,839
 Oh, Bridget

242
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
 She's a natural blonde

243
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:34,479
 Her bottom is big

244
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 And she wears a thong

245
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 So, do I get a job too?

246
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,118
 Next time in Extra - 

247
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,278
 Nick becomes a pilot,

248
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,158
 Hector is his hostess

249
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,158
 and why has Eunice come to stay?

250
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,158
 and why has Eunice come to stay?
