1
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of Bridget
 and Annie, who share a flat in London

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
 and the boys next door - 
 Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Hector and Annie
 still love each other.

4
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,159
 Bridget still loves herself.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 And Nick loves babes,
 motorbikes and pizza.

6
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
 And I can see
 a great big bowl of dog food.

8
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,959
 And on the bowl, it says a name.

9
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,679
 It says...

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,479
 'Charley'!

11
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 It must be teatime, Charley.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,519
 Guess what!

13
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,039
 You've just met Brad Pitt.

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,039
 What? Don't be ridiculous, Annie.

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,238
 I've just been to see Rose Marie.

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,239
 -  Who's Rose Marie?
 -  My fortune teller.

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,880
 And she says I'm going to meet
 a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,478
 Oooh! When?

19
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,359
 She didn't say.

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
 -  Where?
 -  She didn't say.

21
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,758
 It must be true then.

22
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,759
 Maybe I'll meet him
 at tonight's Halloween party.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,918
 Have you read
 your horoscopes for today?

24
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,918
 -  No.
 -  Read mine.

25
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,919
 Aquarius, Libra, Leo...

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
 Ah, Taurus -  the Bull.

27
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,039
 'Taurus -  today,
 you will be in for a big surprise.'

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
 Ooh, goody.

29
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,919
 I'm getting a name...

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 It's...Nick.

31
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,279
 Gigi, you must be psychic.

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,959
 -  Sidekick?
 -  No.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
 Not 'sidekick', 'psychic'.
 A fortune- teller.

34
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,558
 Someone who can see the future.

35
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,879
 Ah, like Nostradamus?

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,839
 -  Who?
 -  Kind of.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,840
 Like horoscopes, or tarot.

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,439
 The tarot. The Death card.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 Look, it's Bridget with no make- up.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Like...
 having the palm of your hand read.

41
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,279
 Ah, rubbish! There's nothing there.

42
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,399
 What a surprise!

43
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,478
 Come here, give me your hand.

44
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,279
 I'll give you a lesson.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
 This one is your life line.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
 -  This one is your love line.
 -  Oh, yes?

47
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,359
 And this one is your...punch line!

48
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,278
 Punch line?

49
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,279
 She means it's the end of my lesson.

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,039
 Hey, Hector.

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,040
 What happens when you go
 to a fortune- teller's house?

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,520
 Come in!

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,399
 Ha ha!

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,439
 Let's see what your horoscope says.

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,478
 You don't believe all that rubbish?

56
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,479
 Rose Marie says Bridget is going to
 meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

57
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,998
 Hector...

58
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,999
 Bridget, this is my tall, dark,
 handsome stranger. Get your own!

59
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,359
 -  Who is Rose Marie?
 -  My fortune- teller.

60
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,919
 Is she good- looking?
 Could she find me a cute babe?

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 -  Do you want to hear your horoscope?
 -  Go on then. Aquarius.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 Aquarius, eh? I should've guessed.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,160
 'This week, beware of black hair

64
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 and the number three.'

65
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,759
 That means that three babes with
 black hair are going to chase me.

66
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,999
 -  Spooky!
 -  Can I be Aquarius?

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,440
 -  No!
 -  Come on, Hector, let's go out.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,640
 I'm going to meet
 some black- haired babes.

69
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,359
 Put that umbrella down - 
 it's very unlucky.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 But I'm feeling lucky.

71
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,399
 I wish I could meet
 a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

72
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,919
 Well, let me look into my crystal ball.

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 Annie, that's a goldfish bowl.

74
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,119
 So? I got it right for Charley.
 Didn't I, Charley?

75
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,399
 That could be my stranger now.

76
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,279
 Hello, Bernard.

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,758
 Hello, Bernard. How are you?

78
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,959
 Not happy, not happy at all.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,118
 I've lost my Marbles.

80
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,119
 Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,439
 What?

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,638
 You mean Marbles your cat?

83
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,639
 And she's not well - 
 she's got a cold.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,278
 Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find her.

85
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,638
 We'll look out for her, Bernard.

86
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,639
 I hope so. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,798
 Poor Bernard.

88
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,918
 He's lost his marbles.

89
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,919
 It had to happen.

90
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,479
 And on the bowl, it says a name.

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 It says...Charley!

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Hello, Bernard.

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

94
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,159
 You don't believe all that rubbish, do you?

95
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,318
 ..are going to chase me.

96
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,319
 Spooky!

97
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,960
 I'm feeling lucky!

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
 This is a true story about
 a man and wife on their honeymoon.

99
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,759
 They were in the car, it was late.

100
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,159
 The wife broke her mirror,
 which means seven years bad luck.

101
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,199
 Just then, they ran out of petrol.

102
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,679
 So, the man told the wife
 to go for petrol.

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,118
 He's the man, he should've gone.

104
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,119
 Equal opportunities.

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 The wife was gone for a long time.

106
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,679
 Then...

107
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,440
 He heard a noise
 on the roof of the car.

108
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,920
 It got louder.

109
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,759
 And then...

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,078
 his wife appeared.

111
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,079
 She smiled and walked away.

112
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 The noise was very loud.

113
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,399
 The man got out of his car
 and standing on the roof, he saw...

114
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
 a madman holding his wife's head!

115
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 So, the banging was...

116
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,639
 ..her head?

117
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,639
 But he'd just seen his wife.

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
 That...

119
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 was her ghost.

120
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,639
 Is that a true story?

121
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,718
 Yeah.

122
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,719
 -  Tell us another.
 -  No, don't.

123
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,878
 I mean, it was a bit dull, wasn't it?

124
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,319
 Come on,
 let's go shopping for the party.

125
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,238
 Yeah, I'm in the mood now.

126
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:05,239
 Are you coming, Nick?

127
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,640
 No. See you later.

128
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,199
 One, two...

129
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 -  Beware of black hair...
 -  Three apples.

130
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 ..and the number three.

131
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:29,319
 So what? There are three apples.

132
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 Big deal.

133
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
 Seven years of bad luck...

134
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
 What rubbish!

135
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,919
 I think I'll go back to my apartment now.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
 Black cat...black hair.

137
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
 Right, keep calm.

138
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 Nice pussy.

139
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 Who's there?

140
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,840
 Number...number three.

141
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,359
 Stop!

142
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,759
 Nick? Nick? Nick?

143
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,198
 He's coming round.

144
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,959
 What's going on?
 Why are you dressed like that?

145
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,359
 Nick, have you forgotten?

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,360
 It's Halloween.
 We're going to the party.

147
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,478
 Oh, yeah.

148
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,479
 I cannot get this knife
 into the pumpkin. Can you...?

149
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
 Yeah.

150
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
 Trick or treat?

151
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 Treat.

152
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,398
 There you are.

153
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,399
 Thank you.

154
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,278
 -  Aren't they sweet?
 -  Yeah.

155
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,279
 Sweet.

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 This is a true story about
 a man and wife on their honeymoon.

157
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,239
 I think I'll go back to my apartment now.

158
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,519
 One, two...three apples.

159
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,079
 Those witches were very cute.

160
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,399
 -  I think the small one fancied you.
 -  You think so?

161
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,119
 Boys, they weren't pretending.

162
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,478
 They really were witches.

163
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,479
 They were ugly enough.

164
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,718
 Hey, the lights have gone out.

165
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,038
 It must be the storm.

166
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,039
 A power cut!

167
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,759
 What was that?

168
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 Who was that?

169
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,199
 Bernard,
 what are you doing on the roof?

170
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 I still can't find my Marbles.

171
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,799
 -  Your marbles?
 -  His cat.

172
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 Bernard, I really don't think
 that you should be on the roof.

173
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,559
 Bernard, are you OK?

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,560
 Yeah, fine.
 I'll kill that cat when I find it.

175
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 I know, we'll light a candle.

176
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,760
 Well, there's no television,
 so I guess it's time for bed.

177
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
 Oh, no!

178
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 What's the matter, boys?
 Are you scared of the dark?

179
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,439
 No.

180
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 Well, if you're not scared
 of the dark, then let's play a game.

181
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,439
 -  A game?
 -  Let's get the ouija board out.

182
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,678
 B -  that's you, Bridget.

183
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,679
 Fan- ci- es...

184
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,798
 N -  that's you, Nick.

185
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,799
 Bridget fancies Nick!

186
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 Don't be so childish.
 Give that to me.

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 It's getting warm. I can feel...

188
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,359
 It's starting to move.

189
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,240
 H -  that's you, Hector.

190
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,599
 Depart. But I am not leaving.

191
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,599
 Depart.

192
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 'Dearly departed' means dead.

193
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,919
 That's it, I am leaving.

194
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,920
 Hector, sit down!

195
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 -  You are moving the glass, Bridget.
 -  No, I'm not.

196
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 N -  I think it's for you, Nick.

197
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 Oh, great, it'll be about babes.

198
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,598
 Three what?

199
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,599
 Didn't your horoscope say,
 'Beware of the number three?'

200
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,438
 Oh, yeah.

201
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,558
 You don't believe
 that rubbish, do you?

202
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,559
 Of course I do. Don't you?

203
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
 Well, the lights are back on.

204
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,599
 I'm tired.

205
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,318
 Why don't you depart then?

206
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,319
 Great idea.
 Come on, Hector, let's go.

207
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,598
 -  Hector?
 -  Eh?

208
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,198
 Do you believe in horoscopes?

209
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,438
 -  Of course not.
 -  No, of course not.

210
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,159
 They're silly.

211
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,959
 'Beware of black hair
 and the number three.'

212
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,879
 -  Rubbish!
 -  Yeah.

213
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 It could've meant, 'Beware of those
 three witches we met at the party.'

214
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,798
 Well, they did have black hair.

215
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,959
 Or those three trick or treaters.

216
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Trick or treat?

217
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,239
 Or the black cat.

218
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 -  What was that noise?
 -  Probably the wind.

219
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,519
 Yeah, the wind.

220
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,519
 -  Hector?
 -  Eh?

221
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,238
 Can I get into your bed?

222
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:59,239
 OK.

223
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,639
 -  I'm not afraid of the dark.
 -  Nor am I.

224
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,599
 I've only got one torch - 
 it's good to share.

225
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
 The storm's finished.

226
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,439
 What's that noise?

227
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 It's in the room.

228
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,039
 It's getting nearer.

229
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 -  Who's that?
 -  I don't know.

230
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 Nick, there is something
 touching my legs.

231
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
 -  Well, it's not me.
 -  I know.

232
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 But there is something
 touching my legs.

233
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 Bernard, did you hear that scream?

234
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,238
 What are you doing?

235
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,239
 I think Marbles is in there.

236
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,119
 Right, we're going in.

237
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 Hector, Nick? What's the matter?

238
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
 Marbles, there you are!

239
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,159
 How's your cold?

240
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,039
 Are you two OK?

241
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,159
 What's wrong?

242
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
 Has the cat got your tongue?

243
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,599
 Next time in Extra::

244
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
 Nick goes shopping.

245
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,159
 Hector tells Annie the truth.

246
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,519
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?

247
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,119
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?

248
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?
