1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,840
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
 Hector works as a reporter on Channel 9

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,079
 and is going out with Annie.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,359
 Bridget works at Channel 9 as well

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,319
 but is not going out with Nick.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,919
 They all need a holiday.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,999
 'Who would be your ideal holiday romance?

10
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,078
 'A) J.Lo...

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,559
 'B) Cameron Diaz...

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
 'or C) Kylie?'

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 Difficult to choose.

14
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,879
 All three!

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,759
 'What do you like most about girls on holiday?

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
 'A) Their suntans...'

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,238
 Yeah, OK.

18
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,239
 'B) Their bikinis...'

19
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,598
 Yeah!

20
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,399
 'C) Their...'

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 Ironing skills?

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
 'Where do you meet girls on holiday?

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,919
 'A) On the beach...

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,959
 'B) In the bar...

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
 'C) On the ski slope?'

26
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,839
 On the beach...

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
 Yeah, I meet lots of lovely girls
 on the beach.

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 Oh, Nick... Oh, Nick... Nick ...

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,399
 Nick!

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,238
 Nick!

31
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,239
 Nick...

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,039
 Nick, I am fed up.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,038
 I need a holiday.

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,519
 We all need a holiday.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,199
 I'm exhausted.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
 So, it is holiday time again

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 and everyone is off to the airport.

39
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,918
 Hello, Hector.

40
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,919
 They are travelling to Florida,
 Thailand, Egypt and...Belgium?

41
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
 Are you sure?And Belgium.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 Travelling by plane, by train and by car.

43
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,439
 Well, maybe not by car.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,680
 Bridget will be furious.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Still, maybe a new fashion.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,039
 Yes, yes.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 Can he do the interview on Thursday?

49
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,958
 No. Well, what about Friday?

50
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,518
 Hang on.

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,038
 Hello.

52
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,838
 She wants 22 dressing rooms?

53
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,839
 Four for Lourdes and her nannies?

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,758
 But we've only got two.

55
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,719
 Hello?

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,599
 For goodness' sake!

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 Who wants Madonna anyway?

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 Hello, are you still there?

59
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,879
 Hello! What?

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,958
 Hello, Eunice.

61
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,959
 Yes, David Beckham is booked
 and so is Princess Caroline of Monaco.

62
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,959
 No, Madonna is not coming.

63
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,919
 Yes, OK, Eunice, I will.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,879
 I will, today.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,559
 Bye, Eunice.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 What did your last slave die of?

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 What I need, what I really need is a holiday.

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 Go on, type New York.

69
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,638
 Gatwick.

70
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Number of nights -  three.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,718
 Three.

72
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,719
 OK, let's see what they can do.

73
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,518
 Â£1,000?

74
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,719
 That's much too expensive.

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,118
 We must choose a different destination.

76
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,958
 Yeah...

77
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,999
 How about Las Vegas?

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But that would cost even more.
 Don't be silly, Nick.

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 What? Is Nick being silly? I don't believe it.

80
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,079
 I'm so tired.

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 Hector, I saw your holiday report.

82
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,799
 I have just spent all day

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 watching other people go on holidays.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
 I can't go on!

85
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,158
 Eunice is a witch.

86
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,158
 She makes me work, work, work.

87
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,518
 -  Why don't you leave, then?
 -  Yeah.

88
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,918
 What? Leave my job?

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,519
 I love my job.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,318
 Women!

91
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,319
 What you need... What we all need is a...

92
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,759
 Holiday!

93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,879
 A holiday!

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,959
 Great idea!

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,318
 Where shall we go?

96
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,319
 I'd love to go to Las Vegas.

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,719
 Cape Town.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 I'd like to go anywhere with Enrique Iglesias.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 What about Spain?

100
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,399
 You speak Spanish.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 -  You can be our guide.
 -  Well...

102
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,959
 Enrique Iglesias speaks Spanish.

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 And the girls!

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,238
 I can't wait!

105
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,239
 Hey, Hector,
 you can translate my chat- up lines.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 Well, I'll try.

107
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,919
 And we can try them out.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 Yeah!

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,599
 Hector.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 There's your ironing.

111
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,478
 Nick.

112
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,479
 There's yours.

113
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 I need a holiday.

114
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
 Where shall we go?

115
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,198
 And the girls!

116
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,199
 I can't wait!

117
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 OK, I see a pretty Spanish girl...

118
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,918
 How do I say...

119
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,919
 'I'm English. Can you
 give me directions...to your apartment?'

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,599
 -  Really?
 -  Yeah.

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
 OK.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 Good, but this one is better.

123
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,559
 Your eyes are like stars.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
 They come out at night.

125
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,278
 I like it!

126
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,279
 How do I say it in Spanish?

127
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
 -  That's what I said.
 -  OK.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 Now, this one always works.

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 I know what you're thinking.

130
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,598
 You want to kiss me, don't you?

131
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,199
 No, I don't.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 Not you! It's the chat- up line, stupid.

133
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,038
 Hector, are you there?

134
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,039
 Yeah.

135
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,559
 Could you give me a hand with my luggage?

136
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
 Sure.

137
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,439
 All of it?

138
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 Yes, all of it, please, Hector.

139
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 Over here, Hector. I must do a final check.

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
 Good gracious, Bridget.
 What have you got in there?

141
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
 Six T- shirts,
 three pairs of jeans, four pairs of trousers,

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
 ten bikinis, four sarongs, two skirts,

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 two nightdresses, three pairs of trainers,
 two pairs of evening shoes,

144
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,479
 three toothbrushes, two toilet bags,
 five belts, two jackets,

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
 two cans of hair mousse and a ball gown.

146
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,718
 But we're only going for three days.

147
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,719
 You never can be sure
 what event we'll be asked to go to.

148
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,599
 Parties, balls, the opera, theatre...

149
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,758
 Oh, yeah...

150
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,759
 It won't happen.

151
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,959
 When Bridget arrives in Spain,
 we'll be invited everywhere.

152
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 They just won't be able to resist.

153
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,038
 What won't they be able to resist?

154
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,039
 What are you wearing?

155
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,439
 I am a toreador.

156
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,119
 Whose is this?

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,559
 Bridget's.

158
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,918
 You are taking all that?

159
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,998
 Yeah. Why?

160
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,678
 Bridget, Bridget, Bridget...

161
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,679
 All you need to travel
 is your passport, your tickets and your money.

162
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,119
 That will be the taxi.

163
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,598
 Let's go.

164
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,599
 Come on, boys,
 give me a hand with my luggage.

165
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
 Gatwick airport, please.

166
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 All you need to travel is your passport,
 your tickets and your money, Nick.

167
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,919
 Yeah, yeah, very funny.

168
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,118
 Wow, look at this!

169
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,479
 -  It's so Spanish.
 -  Yep.

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 Typical Spanish hospitality.

171
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
 And this is a typical happy Spanish waitress.

172
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,199
 Hello.

173
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 We are from England.

174
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 And we would like a drink, please.

175
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,519
 Girls, girls, girls, leave it to me.

176
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 I must translate for you.

177
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,678
 Hang on.

178
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,679
 I'll talk to the lady.

179
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,679
 She doesn't look very happy.

180
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 No, she looks a mess.

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,359
 Perhaps her boyfriend has left her.

182
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,919
 Yes, because she looks a mess.

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,518
 Maybe he didn't like her hair.

184
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,519
 Actually, he did like my hair
 and at least mine is natural.

185
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,799
 She understood.

186
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,798
 She's English.

187
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
 How did you guess?

188
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,399
 So, is this a traditional Spanish bar?

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 This is a traditional English tearoom.

190
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,279
 In Barcelona?

191
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,280
 Aren't you clever?

192
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
 Leave it to me.

193
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,120
 Please can we have a drink?

194
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,238
 No.

195
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,119
 Why not?

196
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
 There are no tables.

197
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
 -  What about this one?
 -  No.

198
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,399
 Or that one?

199
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,839
 -  No.
 -  What about this one here?

200
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,318
 It's reserved.

201
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,319
 Never mind, let's go.

202
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
 But if you reserve the table,
 you can come in.

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,838
 OK.

204
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,839
 Can we please reserve a table?

205
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
 Certainly.

206
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
 Yes, I can just fit you in. That table there.

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 You never can be sure
 what event we'll be asked to go to.

208
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,719
 Wow, look at this! It's so Spanish.

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 She understood.

210
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:56,199
 Yes, I can just fit you in. That table there.

211
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,039
 Right, what would you like to drink?

212
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,318
 -  Cola, please.
 -  Me too.

213
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,039
 And me.

214
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 In Spain, do as the English do.

215
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,519
 I will have a nice cup of tea, please.

216
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,439
 Which tea?

217
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,479
 -  What have you got?
 -  We've got Darjeeling, Kenyan,

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey,
 camomile, peppermint,

219
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,240
 jasmine, Imperial, Oolong,
 Indian, green and yellow tea.

220
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,719
 I'll have a cola please.

221
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,839
 Anything to eat?

222
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,719
 Yes, please. What have you got?

223
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,599
 Egg and chips, sausage and chips, fish and chips,

224
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 cheese and chips, pie and chips
 and chicken and...

225
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,919
 Chips.

226
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 Chicken and croquette potatoes.

227
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,359
 So, we can have anything with chips.

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,758
 Apart from chicken.

229
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,278
 Or I have cake.

230
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,799
 Gatox.

231
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,438
 Gatox?

232
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
 I think she means gateaux.

233
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,959
 Gatox, please.

234
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
 Spanish girls are beautiful.

235
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
 Great! And French girls.

236
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
 Really?

237
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,478
 I don't believe it.

238
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,479
 -  What?
 -  Over there. Over there.

239
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,598
 Yeah?

240
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,438
 -  It's him!
 -  Who?

241
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,319
 Enrique!

242
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,879
 Enrique? Que?

243
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 Not Enrique, que -  Enrique Iglesias!

244
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,238
 No! Are you sure?

245
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:12,239
 -  It can't be!
 -  This is Spain. Well, he's from Spain.

246
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:17,199
 -  Well?
 -  I must go and talk to him.

247
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,119
 -  Hair?
 -  Check.

248
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,958
 -  Lipstick?
 -  Check.

249
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,959
 Top?

250
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,719
 -  Check.
 -  Right.

251
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 Here I go.

252
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,159
 Where's Bridget going?

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
 Enrique Iglesias
 is sitting over there at that table.

254
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 No!

255
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,079
 Enrique!

256
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,239
 -  That is not Enrique Iglesias.
 -  No way.

257
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 Poor Bridget.

258
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 Still, he is quite good- looking.

259
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,438
 Latin men are different to English men.

260
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,439
 They are not sensitive, gentle,
 romantic and sophisticated, like me.

261
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 Gatox.

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,719
 I think the waitress fancies you, Nick.

263
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 Go on, try one of your chat- up lines on her.

264
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:51,559
 She's not my type.

265
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 So what is your type, Nick?

266
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,839
 She's coming back! Go on, go on!

267
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,679
 Which one, which one? I've forgotten them all.

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,680
 Use my one. Stars, stars.

269
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,279
 OK, I remember.

270
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,319
 Your teeth are like stars.

271
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:16,239
 They come out at night.

272
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 It's obvious. She's crazy about me.

273
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,199
 I've got a date with him!
 I've got a date with him!

274
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,198
 Who? Mr Iglesias?

275
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,199
 Don't be silly.
 Of course it's not Enrique Iglesias.

276
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,680
 I'm not that stupid.

277
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 It's Miguel, and tonight we're going clubbing.

278
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,358
 -  Great!
 -  Where are we going?

279
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,359
 No, not you. Miguel and me.

280
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,359
 No, Bridget, we must be your chaperones.

281
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 Yeah, you will not even notice us.

282
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,478
 Well, all right, then.

283
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,479
 All those Spanish girls - clubbing!

284
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,279
 Clubbing! Let's boogie, baby!

285
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,479
 I'll show you how it's done.

286
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,479
 Next time in Extra...

287
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
 England play Argentina in the World Cup.

288
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,799
 Nick gets a phone call.

289
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 And Bridget has a bad hair day.

290
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,159
 And Bridget has a bad hair day.
