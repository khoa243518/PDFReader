1
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,039
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,879
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 Hector andAnnie want to get married.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Bridget also wants to get married,
 but to whom?

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,039
 And Nickjust wants to get away.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,798
 Hector, it's perfect!

8
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
 Yeah, perfect.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,039
 Hector, you have mail.

10
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,879
 And they're all from your mother.

11
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,959
 -  Shall I?
 -  Yes, please, do.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
 What do they say?

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,998
 Well, she says...

14
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,999
 'How many bridesmaids is Annie having?

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,839
 'Ten or twelve?'

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,158
 Ten or twelve?

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,159
 You will like this one, Annie.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
 'Have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
 'I'm coming to London soon, to help you.'

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,958
 Hector!

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,959
 Your mother is very kind,
 but we want a small wedding.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,199
 She must not interfere.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
 Annie.

24
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,479
 Hector, we want our pet wedding, don't we?

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, she must not interfere any more.

26
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 It's OK. I won't let her. Come here.

27
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,919
 You look happy!

28
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,198
 Man trouble?

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,199
 How is...Miguel?

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
 Miguel is finished.

31
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
 It's all football, football, football with Miguel.

32
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,319
 What do you expect from Spanish men?

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 So, I said, 'Bye- bye, Miguel.'

34
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,358
 And Annie and Hector are so happy.

35
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,359
 It's weddings, weddings, weddings.

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 I'll never find a decent man.

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,478
 I'll just be single forever!

38
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,479
 Rubbish!
 What you need is a new man in your life.

39
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 But where can I get one?

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
 Hi. Bridget here.
 Can I have a new man, please?

41
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,799
 What about that gorgeous...Nick?

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,079
 Nick?

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 He's great as Pierce Steele in London On Fire.

44
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,118
 What a hunk!

45
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,119
 But he's...

46
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479
 Come on, Bridget,
 you say you want a new man.

47
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,479
 Well, let me introduce you to the new Nick.

48
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,159
 I want you to interview him
 for Stars at 9 on 9.

49
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,558
 Interview Nick?

50
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,439
 But all he talks about is girls.

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
 -  And motorbikes.
 -  Forget what he says.

52
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,679
 Ask him to take his jacket off!

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 Here, look at this.

54
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,879
 London On Fire.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 Enjoy it!

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 Oh, Pierce,
 how can I ever thankyou?

57
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,199
 It was nothing.

58
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
 It's all in a day's work for...

59
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,239
 Pierce Steele.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Nick.

61
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
 Come and sit down.

62
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,879
 OK.

63
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,718
 What are you reading?

64
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,359
 A magazine about weddings.

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 I love weddings. Don't you?

66
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
 The problem is I'm always the bridesmaid,
 never the bride.

67
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,958
 Isn't it lovely?

68
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,959
 Yeah! The Ferrari Testarossa.

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
 -  What a great car!
 -  I meant her dress!

70
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,038
 Do you like it, Nick?

71
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,039
 Well, it wouldn't suit me.

72
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,559
 Nick, you're so funny.

73
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,559
 I love funny men.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,839
 I need a drink. Would you like one?

75
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
 And good- looking ones.

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 I'd love to marry a funny, good- looking man.

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
 By the way, Nick, I saw London On Fire.

78
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,918
 You're very good in it.

79
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,478
 Really? Did you think so?

80
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,759
 In fact, I wondered if...

81
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,358
 -  Yeah?
 -  If you want to...

82
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,398
 -  Yeah?
 -  Will you...

83
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,399
 -  Yeah?
 -  Will you do an interview for Channel 9?

84
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 Yeah.

85
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,359
 She must not interfere.

86
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,359
 Interview Nick?

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
 But all he talks about is girls.
 And motorbikes.

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
 Will you do an interview for Channel 9?

89
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,239
 Yeah.

90
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,279
 Courtesy of Mrs Romero. Reception venues.

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 Courtesy of Mrs Romero. Wedding dresses.

92
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,039
 Courtesy of Mrs Romero. Honeymoons.

93
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,399
 Hector's mother is driving me mad!

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
 Maybe I should just cancel the wedding.

95
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,919
 Really? Well, I wouldn't.

96
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,439
 I suppose marriage will mean sacrifices.

97
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,999
 No more shaving your legs on the toilet,
 no more soaps on TV.

98
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,399
 -  Oh, no!
 -  No more midnight chocolate feasts.

99
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,039
 But then...you will be Mrs Romero.

100
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,879
 Do you think Bridget is ill?

101
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,118
 No. Why?

102
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,119
 She's being very nice to me. Very nice.

103
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,879
 Well, maybe she is ill.

104
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 She was talking about weddings,
 you and Annie.

105
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 You don't think she wants to get married too,
 do you?

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,078
 Who to?

107
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,079
 Well, you said she was being very nice to you.

108
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
 No! You don't think?

109
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
 Annie.

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,640
 I have something to tell you.

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 -  What?
 -  Nick.

112
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,359
 Nick what?

113
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
 I fancy Nick.

114
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 She did mean me!

115
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,319
 Hector, help!

116
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,879
 Once you're married, they've got you!

117
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 -  You fancy Nick?
 -  Yes, I do. I do!

118
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,039
 -  But you don't like Nick.
 -  I do like Nick.

119
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,639
 -  No, you don't, you think he's an idiot.
 -  Yes, but he's so macho.

120
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 -  You think he's vain.
 -  But he's so good- looking.

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,558
 You don't like his clothes.

122
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,559
 But now he wears a fireman's uniform.

123
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
 So that's it! The uniform.

124
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,039
 He's so sexy in London On Fire.

125
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
 So what are you going to do?

126
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
 Tomorrow I will interview him for Channel 9...

127
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,398
 And then?

128
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,918
 You'll just have to wait and see.

129
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,919
 There is one good thing about getting married.

130
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
 Yeah, love.

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,798
 No! No!

132
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,799
 The stag night.

133
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,599
 -  The what?
 -  The stag night.

134
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 It's when the bridegroom, that's you,
 is taken out by his best man, that's me,

135
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
 to say goodbye.

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 -  Goodbye?
 -  Yep, to your fantastic life as a single man.

137
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,039
 Goodbye to drinking beer
 and watching football in bed.

138
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 Goodbye to eating curry for breakfast.

139
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 And worst of all...

140
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 goodbye to Kylie Minogue!

141
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 Don't worry, Hector, we will face this together.

142
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,639
 Thank you, Nick. You are a real friend.

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 Anyway...

144
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,719
 this stag night...

145
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,719
 what are we going to do?

146
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,198
 -  Go to the cinema?
 -  Wha...

147
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,199
 In England, we do crazy things!

148
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 We party, we go to Brighton, we dress up...

149
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,399
 -  As what?
 -  Women!

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 So I am here with Nick Jessop,

151
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,359
 or Pierce Steele,
 straight from the set of London On Fire.

152
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,439
 -  Nick.
 -  Good evening.

153
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 Do you think London On Fire accurately reflects

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 the pressures
 on London's emergency services?

155
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,639
 Dunno! But the women are good- looking.

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,839
 Do you get very hot?

157
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,678
 -  When?
 -  In the flames, when you're filming.

158
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,679
 No, not really.

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,678
 Do you take your jacket off sometimes?

160
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,199
 Yeah, sometimes.

161
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 -  When it gets very...hot?
 -  Yeah.

162
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
 -  Do you want to take your jacket off now?
 -  No, not really.

163
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,798
 -  And what about the women?
 -  The women?

164
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,118
 The women you rescue.

165
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,119
 You carry them out of the house that is on fire.

166
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 -  Yeah.
 -  They must love it.

167
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,119
 Well, they are acting.

168
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
 -  And do they ask you to...
 -  Do they ask me to what?

169
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,038
 -  Take your jacket off.
 -  No.

170
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,039
 Will you take it off now?

171
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,839
 OK.

172
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:09,398
 -  Could you carry me?
 -  When?

173
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,399
 Now! Carry me like you do on London On Fire!

174
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,278
 OK.

175
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,318
 You're so strong!

176
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,319
 This is Bridget Evans with Nick Jessop
 for Channel 9.

177
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,159
 -  Shall I put you down now?
 -  Do you have to?

178
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,079
 Hi, Hector.

179
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,959
 Hi, Annie.

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,998
 -  Hector...
 -  Annie...

181
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,999
 -  No, you go first.
 -  No, you first.

182
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
 OK. Annie, this wedding...

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 I was going to say, 'This wedding...'

184
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,159
 -  OK, you say it, then.
 -  No, you.

185
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,158
 OK, let's write it down.

186
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,159
 Good idea.

187
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,439
 Ready?

188
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
 One, two, three, show!

189
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
 Yes, Hector, let's wait.

190
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,119
 -  This wedding is a nightmare.
 -  Yeah.

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 -  Let's celebrate not getting married.
 -  Yeah.

192
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,839
 OK, I'm going shopping now,
 but meet me at Leo's Cafe at 5pm.

193
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,879
 I'll be there!

194
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,479
 You must tell your mother. Thank goodness
 she's thousands of miles away in Argentina.

195
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 Make sure you tell her before she leaves.

196
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,479
 Oh, no!

197
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 Meet me at Leo's cafe at 5pm.

198
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,839
 Annie...or Mum?

199
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,359
 Mum...or Annie?

200
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,479
 Nick, you're so funny!

201
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 The stag night!

202
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 The what?

203
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,439
 We dress up!

204
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
 -  As what?
 -  Women.

205
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,359
 You're so strong!

206
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,038
 Hi, Nick. Did you have a good day?

207
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,399
 Great! I saved London again.

208
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:04,199
 And I was interviewed by Bridget.

209
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,239
 Man, I thought
 she was going to ask me to marry her!

210
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 Great.

211
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 OK, what's up?

212
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 My mother is coming to London.

213
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,799
 -  Does Annie know?
 -  No.

214
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,958
 Whoops!

215
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,958
 But we have cancelled the wedding.

216
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,239
 -  Does your mother know?
 -  No.

217
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,038
 Whoops!

218
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,878
 It gets worse.

219
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,879
 I was supposed to meet both of them
 this afternoon in different places.

220
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,398
 Triple whoops!

221
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,399
 Hector, don't worry.

222
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,679
 Women always forget.

223
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,919
 Hi, Annie.

224
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 -  Hector, where are you?
 -  Annie, listen!

225
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 I'm glad we're not getting married!

226
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,159
 So they didn't forget?

227
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 Annie, please!

228
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,959
 -  Listen to me!
 -  What or who is more important than me?

229
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,479
 -  First marriage row.
 -  We are not getting married.

230
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,598
 Pardon me!

231
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,679
 Annie, today was difficult.

232
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,679
 Impossible.

233
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,478
 I don't want to know!

234
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,479
 -  Annie, it's my mother.
 -  What about your mother?

235
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,239
 Here is Mother!

236
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,759
 Hector, darling!

237
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
 Speak to me in English. I'm taking lessons.

238
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,599
 Where's Annie? Where's my little bride?

239
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,279
 What a beauty!
 Hector, you've kept her beauty a secret.

240
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
 No, Mama, this is Bridget.

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 This is Annie.

242
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,119
 Donatella...can help you.

243
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,719
 Annie is the prettiest, sweetiest,
 kindest girl in the world.

244
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,639
 Really?

245
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,479
 Didn't you tell her the wedding is off?

246
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
 -  I didn't get the chance.
 -  Well, now's the time.

247
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,318
 -  Mum.
 -  Yes?

248
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,319
 Annie and I have decided to...

249
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
 Wait a few years before we get married.

250
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,559
 No wedding? Oh, no!

251
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:53,879
 Thank you, Bridget.

252
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,039
 Do you have a boyfriend?

253
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 I hope so, Mrs Romero.

254
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,319
 Is he handsome?

255
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 Yes, he's very handsome...

256
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,959
 and muscular!

257
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 I love macho men.

258
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,199
 What's his name?

259
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 Nick. Nick Jessop.

260
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 Nick? Hector's best man?

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Yes, that's him.

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Time to party!

263
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,479
 Mama, meet...

264
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,719
 Nick.

265
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 So, have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?

266
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,318
 Next time in Extra...

267
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,238
 Bridget tries to change Nick.

268
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,719
 Hector's mother comes to dinner.

269
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 But why does Annie behave badly?

270
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,118
 But whydoesAnnie behave badly?
