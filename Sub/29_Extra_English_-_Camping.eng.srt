1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,798
 Hector works for Channel 9.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,399
 Annie is getting jealous.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Bridget has seen it all before.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 And Nick just wants to have fun.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,118
 Hello, Nick. Have you lost a button?

9
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,119
 Hi, Bridget.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
 I'm just...

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,079
 practising.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,198
 Practising what?

13
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,199
 I am going to join the SAS.

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,159
 The Special Air Service?

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 -  Yeah.
 -  You?

16
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,319
 What's so funny?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 Nick, the SAS is for tough guys,

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,959
 real men who are fit.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
 They're highly trained.

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 I was in the Scouts.

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
 You...

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 were in the Scouts?

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,359
 Annie.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 Nick's going to join the SAS.

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 That's wonderful, Nick.
 Don't you need special training?

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 It's OK, he was in the Scouts.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,718
 Hello.

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,719
 Here in the National Camping Exhibition...

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,918
 There's Hector.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 ..it is all tents, tents, tents.

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 In every shape, size and colour.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,558
 And Eunice.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,559
 -  And we will be showing you the best...
 -  And the worst of camping.

34
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,958
 So, stick around.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,879
 Back to studio.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags,
 Hector?

38
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,919
 Calm down, Annie, it's only a television report.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 I know but, well,
 he's been working with Eunice a lot recently.

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,758
 And?

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
 And, well, I'm just worried that he...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,198
 well, that she...

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,998
 You know.

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,999
 Annie, don't be silly.
 You've got nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
 Although...

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 Hector is a good- looking man.

47
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,119
 Yep, and she's a good- looking woman.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
 Incoming, Broad Sword calling Danny Boy,

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Broad Sword calling Danny Boy...

50
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,678
 I was watching that.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,278
 Not any more. Go on, it's late.

52
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
 Back to your own tent.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,159
 What's so funny?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,438
 You.

55
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,278
 A Scout.

56
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,158
 Yeah, so?

57
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,159
 I can just imagine.

58
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,039
 Trying to light fires.

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
 Jessop, you cheat.

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 Helping old ladies across the road.

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
 Tying knots.

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 -  What was that?
 -  I didn't hear anything.

63
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,638
 Hello, Hector.

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
 Good evening, Annie.

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,839
 Don't you mean 'good morning'?

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,678
 Where have you been?

67
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,679
 You know, for a couple of beers.

68
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,878
 Who with?

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,879
 With the lads.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 So when did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 I forgot, Eunice was there too.

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 So what did you talk about?

73
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,759
 Tents.

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,118
 Tents?

75
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,119
 You talked about tents all night?

76
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,039
 Where? In her tent?

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,999
 Or yours?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Annie. Annie...

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 I am going to join the SAS.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
 I was in the Scouts.

81
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

82
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Where have you been?

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 When did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,119
 Yes! I've got it!

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,398
 It was my turn for the toy.

86
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 No, you've got the Incredible Hulk.

87
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,599
 So I get two turns.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 -  Hey, Nick.
 -  Yeah?

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 What do you think of Eunice?

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,118
 Well, she isn't an English rose.

91
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,119
 No, I don't think she is a flower.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
 No, it's a saying.

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
 An English rose -  a sweet, pretty girl.

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,318
 -  Like Annie.
 -  No.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,319
 Eunice is not a sweet, pretty girl.

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 No. Eunice is more...

97
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
 What is that plant that grows all over walls
 in England?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,758
 Honeysuckle.

99
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,759
 Wallflower.

100
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
 -  Ivy?
 -  Yeah, ivy.

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 Eunice is more like English ivy.

102
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,519
 -  What do you mean?
 -  Well, she...

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
 Likes dancing?

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,598
 No, she...

105
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,599
 She's all over you?

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
 Do you like it?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 I see trouble ahead.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 What's so funny?

109
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,118
 Come on.

110
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,119
 Share the joke.

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
 It's Hector.

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Hector came home late last night, is that it?

113
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,959
 He was out with Eunice.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,158
 Don't worry about Eunice.

115
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,159
 She likes flirting, that's all.

116
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,759
 This will cheer you up.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 Look what I found.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,519
 It's pictures of us when we were Brownies.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 -  And you're wearing the Brownie uniform.
 -  It still fits.

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
 Look at all your badges.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 What was the Brownie law?

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 A Brownie Guide thinks of others
 before herself...

123
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 And does a good turn every day.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,958
 Remember the Brownie law, Annie.

125
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,999
 OK.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,918
 OK.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
 Hello, Hector. How are you?

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,879
 Fine.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,999
 Did you have a good night's sleep?

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,599
 What was left of it.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 Dib- dib, dob- dob.

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,519
 What's all this, then?

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 It is the Brownie salute.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,879
 That's not a salute.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 This is a salute.

136
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
 -  What do you think, Hector?
 -  Well, both salutes are nice.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,879
 -  Brownies.
 -  Or Scouts.

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,078
 -  Brownies.
 -  Scouts.

139
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,158
 What are you talking about?

140
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
 What are Brownies? Biscuits?

141
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 When Bridget and I were little girls,
 we were Brownies.

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,119
 We went camping, we sang songs.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,959
 We were given badges for good work.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,878
 Brownies are for girls.

145
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,879
 In the Scouts we survived.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 It was just like being in the SAS, wasn't it, Nick?

147
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,558
 Yeah.

148
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,719
 So what are all those badges for?

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,678
 This one is for first aid.

150
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,679
 And what is second aid or third aid?

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 First aid is for helping people who are hurt.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
 How hurt?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,839
 Like if they can't breathe.

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,078
 Shall I demonstrate, Bridget?

155
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,079
 Go ahead, Annie.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Lie down, please, Hector.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
 Now, this is called the kiss of life.

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,358
 Sounds good.

159
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,359
 It means I breathe into your mouth.

160
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
 And if you still can't breathe, I do this.

161
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
 Well, that is...

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 And I keep doing this until you can breathe.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,638
 Are you breathing yet?

164
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
 Yes, yes, yes, I can breathe.

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
 And that is my good turn for the day.

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,278
 Now, Nick,

167
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
 bites and stings.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,599
 No, thanks.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,439
 Of course, when I was in the Scouts,

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,358
 I went camping.

171
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,918
 So did we.

172
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,919
 Ah, but this was proper camping, survival.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,198
 What? Like the SAS?

174
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
 We had to live off the land.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
 What? No tins of baked beans?

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 No.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,039
 So could you do a survival test?

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,119
 Yeah, no problem.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,319
 Yeah.

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
 Right, then.

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,638
 We will give you a survival test.

182
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,639
 Great.

183
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,878
 What is a survival test?

184
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,358
 You'll see.

185
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 Just be prepared.

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,279
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 -  Certainly am.
 -  OK. Test number one.

188
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
 The jungle is full of horrible things
 that creep and crawl.

189
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,959
 And some that wriggle everywhere.

190
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,638
 Especially...

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 worms!

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,878
 OK.

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,879
 Test number two.

194
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,479
 Food.

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 You have run out of food,

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 so you have to eat whatever you can find.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 Open very wide, please.

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 Ready?

199
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,119
 Beetles!

200
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,398
 OK.

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,158
 Test number three.

202
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,159
 Pain.

203
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,558
 I haven't touched you yet.

204
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 I'm sorry, boys,
 you have failed the survival test.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,798
 But in the jungle

206
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,198
 it is going to be different.

207
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,199
 Yeah, we were just pretending.
 It wasn't real.

208
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
 What? Like real camping?

209
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,719
 -  Why don't we do it?
 -  Do what?

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
 -  Let's go camping.
 -  We haven't got a tent.

211
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 Well, Hector can get us a tent
 from the National Camping Exhibition.

212
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,158
 Well, isn't tomorrow
 the last day of the exhibition?

213
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,318
 Yeah.

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,319
 And you and Eunice will be doing another report.

215
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,158
 Yeah.

216
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
 Well, then, you can buy a tent
 and come home early.

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,878
 You'll miss your drinks after work.

218
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,879
 Shame.

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
 What do you think of Eunice?

220
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,359
 I see trouble ahead.

221
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
 Lie down, please, Hector.

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
 That's not a salute.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is a salute.

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,518
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

225
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
 Certainly am.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Worms.

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 Beetles!

228
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,439
 Let's go camping.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,199
 In the jungle it is going to be different.

230
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,319
 You will wake Annie.

231
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,519
 Hey, I have an idea.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 I must show you to Annie.

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
 You know, I have a better idea.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,158
 Come, come.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
 Come. You too, come, come.

236
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
 Nick.

237
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,159
 Nick, wake up.

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
 No more beetles!

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,358
 -  Hector.
 -  Nick.

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,118
 -  What's going on?
 -  I've got it.

241
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,719
 -  Got what?
 -  The tent.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 That's nice.

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,799
 -  Come on, let's put it up.
 -  What?

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,039
 The tent.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,719
 Hector.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,079
 -  Have you seen the time?
 -  No.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,918
 It's three o'clock in the morning!

248
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
 -  Is it?
 -  Yeah.

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,878
 Really?

250
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,879
 Wait a minute.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,439
 Where have you been?

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,438
 For a couple of beers.

253
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,879
 And a dance.

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 What's that on your collar?

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,438
 Paint.

256
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,439
 Pink paint. That's nice.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,158
 When Annie wakes up,

258
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,638
 she is going to be cross with me.

259
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,118
 If she sees that on your collar, she will be.

260
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,238
 Have you been dancing with Eunice?

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,638
 Yes.

262
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,038
 You are dead.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
 But...when Annie sees that I bought the tent...

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,918
 she is going to forgive me.

265
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
 At three o'clock in the morning?

266
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,199
 Late- night shopping.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
 It is OK, Charley, it is me, Hector.

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,358
 Where shall we put it?

269
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,479
 Here.

270
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,638
 Here.

271
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,598
 In the middle.

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
 Guy ropes.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,318
 What?

274
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,599
 -  Guy Ropes, who is he?
 -  No.

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,078
 Guy ropes.

276
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,079
 Ropes called guy ropes.

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 Somewhere here.

278
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,438
 -  Look.
 -  That's them.

279
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 Tie them to the furniture.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,638
 There. That is it.

281
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
 Right, let's go to bed.

282
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,518
 What? What's this?

283
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,798
 Who put that there?

284
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Hi, Annie. I've bought you a tent.

285
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,118
 What is going on?

286
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,119
 Well, do you like your tent?

287
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,159
 Anyone for camping?

288
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,278
 It's so cold.

289
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,199
 I'll warm you up.

290
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,358
 Did somebody say something?

291
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,959
 I want a hot drink.

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,518
 We can't even make a fire.

293
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,519
 And there's no water left.

294
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,359
 How long have we been here?

295
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 It feels like ages.

296
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,999
 It's so creepy.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Yeah. Very creepy.

298
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,719
 Are you tired, Hector?
 Did you have another late night with Eunice?

299
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,879
 So who's going to go outside
 and get us some water?

300
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,238
 Well, I won't.

301
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,239
 Well, I won't either.

302
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,638
 All right, I'll go,

303
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,639
 but if I'm not back in ten minutes,
 you can have my Action Man collection.

304
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off you go.

305
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,919
 Morning, Nick, dear.

306
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
 Thought you and your friends
 would like a nice cup of tea.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,999
 Thanks, Mum.

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Thanks, Mrs Jessop.

309
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,718
 Next time in Extra...

310
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,518
 Bridget gets a new job.

311
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,519
 Hector receives a phone call from Lola.

312
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,479
 And Annie is looking for trouble.

313
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,438
 It's not Eunice. It's not Debbie.

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

315
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

316
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,399
 Could it be Lola?
