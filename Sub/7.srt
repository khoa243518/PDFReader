1
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,119
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,279
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,759
 Nick likes chasing girls
 and wants to be an actor.

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,719
 Bridget fancies Hector,
 but Hector only has eyes for Annie.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,919
 So how does Annie feel about that?

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
 Find out in Extra.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,838
 Well,

8
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,839
 they know I have a sister...

9
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,239
 'I'll see you on the 16th June.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,198
 'My plane lands at 3.00pm.

11
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,199
 'I'll get a taxi from the airport.
 Love you, Chrissy. '

12
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,719
 No, Mama.

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 No.

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,119
 Mothers!

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 My mother thinks I am ten years old.

16
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,159
 My mum treats me like a baby too.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
 My mum doesn't understand me.

18
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,558
 My mum doesn't understand me,

19
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,559
 but Chrissy is perfect.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 -  Who is Chrissy?
 -  She's my sister.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 Excuse me.

22
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,118
 Hi.

23
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,119
 Hello, Mother.

24
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,919
 Yes, Mother,
 I have remembered she's arriving today.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,719
 Hi, Nick.

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,758
 I've come to get my weights.

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,799
 Mr Romero.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 Take off your trousers and lie down, please.

29
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,639
 Pardon, Nick?

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 Please call me Dr Jessop.

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,278
 Dr Jessop?

32
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,279
 Hector, I want a part in the TV show
 Hospital Fever.

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,119
 I need to practise.

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
 Anyway, women love men in white coats.

35
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,598
 -  Really?
 -  So, where does it hurt?

36
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,599
 Where does what hurt?

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,679
 You are my patient,

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,958
 so you must hurt somewhere.

39
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,638
 OK...

40
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,078
 My arm.

41
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,118
 My arm hurts.

42
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,479
 Your leg or your arm?

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,119
 Leg, arm, arm, leg.

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,479
 OK.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,598
 My leg, my leg.

46
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,599
 OK. Sit down, please, Mr Romero.

47
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,279
 Cross your legs. Now...

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,398
 Don't worry, Mr Romero,

49
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,399
 this won't hurt at all.

50
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,479
 Sorry, Nick, it was an accident.

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,878
 OK.

52
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,879
 You have good reflexes.

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,598
 Good.

54
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,599
 Now, Mr Romero...

55
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,879
 please say, 'Ah.'

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,799
 I thought so.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,998
 What?

58
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,158
 You...

59
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,119
 had cornflakes for breakfast.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 Now, I must give you an injection.

61
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,678
 An injection?

62
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Yes, an injection.

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319
 It's open.

64
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,038
 Chrissy!

65
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,519
 You're early.

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,520
 Come in, come in.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,680
 Twinnies!

68
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,479
 Bridget, darling, it's lovely to see you.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,439
 And you, Chrissy.

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,678
 How was your flight?

71
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,999
 Great.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,839
 But can you believe it,

73
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,958
 they lost my luggage.

74
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,318
 Incredible.

75
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,239
 Chrissy, look at you.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 You never change. You're still a teenager.

77
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,119
 Didn't we have fun then?

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,599
 Yeah.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 At school.

80
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,239
 We shared everything.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 Yes, we did.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Anyway, here we are now.

83
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,359
 Bridget.

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,278
 Do you have some clothes I could borrow?

85
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,039
 I travelled in this dress.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 I need something more comfortable.

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,998
 Something like this?

88
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,999
 I bought two for the price of one.

89
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,478
 Bridget,

90
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,479
 this looks really good.

91
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 Great.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 Sorry, I can't exercise. I've hurt my back.

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,719
 Why, Hector,

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
 you are so muscular.

95
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
 Thanks.

96
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,199
 -  How is your mum?
 -  She is such a good friend.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
 She really understands me.

98
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,919
 But I thought that...

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,479
 It's OK.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 I'm here.

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 Where's the emergency?

102
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,479
 Well, hello, Nick.

103
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,959
 The actor.

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
 I love doctors.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Excuse me.

106
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,238
 Hello?

107
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,038
 Hello, Mummy.

108
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,078
 This is it!

109
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,678
 Women love doctors.

110
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,278
 Bridget...

111
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,878
 can't resist me.

112
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,959
 Really?

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hey, darling,

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,198
 come to Nick.

115
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,278
 See you soon, Mummy.

116
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,279
 Love you lots. Bye!

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,839
 So, Doctor...

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 Where were we?

119
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,639
 I think I have a temperature.

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 Madam, I think I can help.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 -  Tell me where it hurts.
 -  Hi, Hector.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,639
 Hi, Nick!

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,319
 Hi, Bridget.

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
 Annie, darling!

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,199
 How are you?

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 Doesn't Nick look good as a doctor?

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,159
 Yes.

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,839
 He looks very...

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 very good.

130
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,438
 Now, you must excuse me,

131
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,439
 I must do my make- up.

132
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
 Bridget is in a really strange mood today.

133
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,159
 A moment ago,
 she said that her mother was her best friend.

134
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,679
 So?

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
 But an hour ago,
 she said that her mother treated her like a baby.

136
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,359
 I am confused.

137
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 I wonder what Bridget was like
 when she was younger.

138
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,479
 I wonder what Annie was like.

139
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,079
 I wonder what Nick was like.

140
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,159
 Nick!

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 I know what Hector was like.

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,159
 Anyway...

143
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 I must continue rehearsing as Dr Jessop.

144
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 Especially as Bridget loves doctors so much.

145
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,799
 Nick only likes Bridget, Bridget, Bridget.

146
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,279
 Am I interrupting?

147
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,439
 No.

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,838
 Yes.

149
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
 Excuse me!

150
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,879
 But why?

151
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 Nick never notices me.

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 And he looks so handsome in his doctor's coat.

153
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,959
 Really?

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,759
 Sweet.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,718
 But I thought that...

156
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,998
 Your faces.

157
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,759
 Are you two...?

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 -  No.
 -  Yes.

159
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 But you look so nice together.

160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,279
 So, Hector,

161
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,280
 are you and Annie dating?

162
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,119
 Well...

163
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,118
 Come on, Hector.

164
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,078
 You can tell me.

165
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,079
 It's not a problem.

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,318
 Really?

167
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,398
 Really.

168
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,519
 OK.

169
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 I really like Annie.

170
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,799
 -  Go on.
 -  But...

171
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,239
 she doesn't notice me.

172
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,078
 Well, ask her on a date.

173
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,079
 Wow. Should I?

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,878
 OK.

175
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,879
 And, Hector...

176
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,358
 when I was at the airport today,

177
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
 I found this magazine.

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,079
 Airport?

179
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,078
 Is this you?

180
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,079
 Are you this rich boy, Hector?

181
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,279
 Yeah.

182
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
 But please don't tell Annie.

183
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,079
 You want her to like you,

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,759
 not your money.

185
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
 Yeah.

186
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 That is so sweet.

187
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,599
 Well, don't you worry.

188
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 Your secret is safe with me.

189
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,319
 Thanks.

190
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,119
 Bridget is in a really good mood today!

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,998
 Really?

192
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,999
 Great.

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,839
 Hi.

194
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,238
 Hi, Nick, darling.

195
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,239
 Or Dr Jessop.

196
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,759
 Would you help me?

197
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,438
 Sure.

198
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,439
 Would you move this exercise bike
 to give me more space?

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
 Sure.

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
 Yeah.

201
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,079
 Yeah!

202
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,239
 You're so strong.

203
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 I...need a drink.

204
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,518
 Would you...like one?

205
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,519
 Yes, please.

206
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,639
 Bridget, darling.

207
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,558
 Have you finished?

208
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 Because now we could make a little sweet music
 of our own, darling.

209
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,279
 In your dreams, Nick.

210
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,279
 Who moved my bike?

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Well, I did, because you...

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,878
 Well, move it back, then.

213
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 If you're strong enough.

214
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,039
 Dr Romero, at your service.

215
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,759
 Hello!

216
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 Hector, you look great!

217
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 I love doctors.

218
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
 Am I interrupting?

219
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 Sweet.

220
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,639
 Would you move this exercise bike
 to give me more space?

221
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 Who moved my bike?

222
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,198
 Hi, Annie.

223
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:41,078
 Hi, Hector.

224
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,079
 Hector, think of a card.

225
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,999
 OK.

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,918
 Ace of diamonds.

227
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,919
 No, don't tell me.

228
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,478
 Annie.

229
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,479
 Yes, Hector?

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 I have something to ask you.

231
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,559
 Yes, Hector?

232
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,439
 The thing is...

233
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,919
 Would you like to come to the cinema
 tomorrow night with me?

234
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Pardon?

235
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,399
 Would you like to come to the cinema
 tomorrow night...

236
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,679
 with me?

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,359
 Well...

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,679
 Yes, I'd like to.

239
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,999
 OK.

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 See you then.

241
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,879
 So, Annie,

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,958
 did Hector ask you out?

243
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,638
 To the cinema, yes.

244
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,719
 Do you want to come?

245
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,318
 Of course not!

246
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,319
 Have a great time.

247
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,199
 I wonder which film we should see.

248
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,199
 When?

249
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 When I go to the cinema with Hector, of course.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,438
 What?

251
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,439
 You and Hector are going to the cinema?

252
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,119
 I don't believe it!

253
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,319
 I'm starving.

254
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,919
 These are my favourite biscuits.

255
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,479
 I think there are some good films on now,
 Annie.

256
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,119
 All the films are rubbish at the moment anyway.

257
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,919
 I'm starving.

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
 I hate these biscuits.

259
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 Now, I must phone the airport.

260
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,238
 What is it, Annie?

261
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,239
 I don't understand.

262
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 If you are there,

263
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,959
 then who is in the bathroom?

264
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 Annie, what are you doing?

265
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,319
 But you're...

266
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,078
 -  You're...
 -  Twins.

267
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,079
 Bridget, I didn't know!

268
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,478
 This is my twin sister Chrissy.

269
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,479
 Didn't I tell you about her?

270
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Now I understand.

271
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,518
 So Nick and Hector

272
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,999
 don't know that you are twins?

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,398
 No, I don't think so.

274
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,518
 You know,

275
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,519
 we could have some fun with this...

276
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 Maybe a magic trick?

277
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,998
 Hector, Nick, come in.

278
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,999
 You are just in time to see my new magic trick.

279
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,879
 Take a seat.

280
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,318
 Wow, I can't wait.

281
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,319
 Ladies and gentlemen.

282
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,199
 Just gentlemen.

283
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 Today I will make my lovely assistant Bridget
 disappear!

284
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560
 Enter, Bridget!

285
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,399
 OK, Bridget, in you go.

286
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,358
 Bridget.

287
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,359
 Bridget!

288
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,679
 I will make Bridget disappear from this box
 and appear in this box.

289
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,158
 This I must see.

290
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,159
 Now a tap with the magic wand.

291
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,839
 Which means that the first box is empty.

292
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,398
 Bridget, you are moving quickly today.

293
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,399
 Let's just check that the other box is empty.

294
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,958
 She's going round the back.

295
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,959
 OK, gentlemen, place your bets, please.

296
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,479
 Which box do you think Bridget is in?

297
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 -  The box on the left.
 -  No, the box on the right.

298
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,838
 OK. Let's see.

299
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,839
 A drum roll, please.

300
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 Gentlemen, applause, please, for...

301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Bridget and Chrissy!

302
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:34,199
 I think there's something wrong
 with the audience.

303
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,079
 Is there a doctor in the house?

304
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120
 Bye, Chrissy. Come back again soon.

305
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,478
 I will, I promise.

306
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,479
 Bye, Bridget.

307
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 Chrissy, I'll miss you.

308
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,399
 She forgot her magazine.

309
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,718
 What?

310
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,518
 It can't be!

311
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,799
 It is.

312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 It's Hector.

313
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,799
 Next time in Extra...

314
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,279
 Hector helps build some new shelves.

315
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
 Nick helps build some new shelves.

316
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 And what happens when the landlady's cousin
 comes to stay?

317
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:33,679
 And what happens when the landlady's cousin
 comes to stay?
