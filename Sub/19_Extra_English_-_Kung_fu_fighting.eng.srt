1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Bridget work in television.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,359
 Annie is a traffic warden.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,559
 And Nick is an actor

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 and one day he may be a star...
 or maybe not.

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,119
 Find out in Extra.

8
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,399
 Ricky Chung -  so sexy!

9
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,119
 -  Ricky Chung?
 -  You know.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,198
 I hate violence.

11
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:26,199
 I hate violence too...
 but I love Ricky Chung.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,040
 Hector, I tell you,
 this is a very old English tradition.

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,119
 -  Really?
 -  Really.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 Now, put your blindfold on.

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 No looking, OK?

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,398
 What is Nick doing?

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,399
 You know, being a genius.

18
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,598
 Right.

19
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,599
 Right, now you can choose one.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,399
 Nick, what are you doing?

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,199
 -  Our floor!
 -  Well...

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
 We must teach Hector
 how to be English.

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,719
 Not an English idiot.

24
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,759
 OK, Nick, now is your turn.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 And this is an old English tradition?

26
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,999
 Absolutely. You need a shower!

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 I think I already have had one.

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 -  That'll be for me.
 -  How do you know?

29
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
 Hello.

30
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,718
 Yes, it is for you, Nick.

31
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,438
 Naturally.

32
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,439
 Hello. Hi.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,679
 Yeah?

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,278
 Yeah!

35
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,598
 Really? Great!

36
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,079
 I'll prepare for it. Bye.

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 Nick, why do you always
 use our number?

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,198
 You're so, so...

39
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,199
 Idiotic? Stupid? Vain? Choose one.

40
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,079
 I have just got an audition for the new...

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,879
 Ricky Chung film!

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,639
 As I was saying,

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
 you're so clever, wonderful, brilliant.

44
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,559
 -  Ricky Chung.
 -  Yeah.

45
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,119
 Ricky Chung.

46
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,959
 I always knew you'd make it to the top.

47
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,599
 Ricky Chung.

48
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,719
 Nick's going to be in a film...
 with Ricky Chung!

49
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,479
 Wait a minute.
 He only has an audition.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,999
 Oh, I'm sure he'll get it.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Then I can interview Ricky Chung.

52
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,078
 Maybe Ricky'll fancy me.

53
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,079
 You? In your dreams!

54
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,199
 Ricky and Bridget.
 Houses in London, Hong Kong...

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
 Yeah, you'll have a house in London

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 and he'll have a house in Hong Kong.

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
 I should get an oriental style.

58
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,319
 New clothes. Come shopping with me?

59
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
 I can't.

60
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,678
 You can't come shopping?

61
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,719
 I have a group meeting.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,639
 Animal Lovers Against Violence.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,038
 And is Hector going with you?

64
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,039
 -  Hector.
 -  What about Hector?

65
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,559
 Well, I've been thinking
 about our relationship.

66
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,119
 Wimp!

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
 But Hector's a good man!

68
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,358
 He ironed your trousers!

69
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,278
 Yes.

70
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,279
 Yes, he did.

71
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,559
 Hello.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
 Hello, Bridget. How are you?

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
 Eunice! Very well, thanks.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 Good.

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
 Channel Nine has to lose people.

76
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,279
 I know. I heard.

77
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,280
 And guess who is the first person to go.

78
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,398
 Who?

79
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,358
 You. You're fired. Ciao!

80
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,359
 Wait!

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 But I'm getting an interview
 with Ricky Chung.

82
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,439
 Ricky Chung?

83
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,559
 If you get the interview,
 you keep your job. No pressure.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,159
 Hi, Annie.

85
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 I've just been watching
 Charlotte's Kitchen on television.

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
 Not again!

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
 Look, I've made you a cake.

88
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,079
 A cake? Really?

89
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,479
 Here, try a piece.

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 OK.

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 -  What's this?
 -  Flower.

92
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,639
 Flower? Why?

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 Well, Charlotte said
 you have to put some flower in the cake.

94
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,958
 No, Hector.

95
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,959
 Some flour.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Some flowers.

97
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,079
 Well, still...

98
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 Tastes good, doesn't it?

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,999
 Hey, Hector.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I have got an audition
 for the new Ricky Chung film.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 -  Superb!
 -  Superb!

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
 One question. Who is Ricky Chung?

103
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,239
 You know. Ricky...

104
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,678
 Chung.

105
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,278
 -  Ricky Chung.
 -  Yeah!

106
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,279
 I know him! He was
 in the Chinese restaurant, wasn't he?

107
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 No. No, no, no! Look...

108
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 I will show you Ricky...

109
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
 Chung!

110
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,599
 So, will you help me to prepare?

111
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,959
 I would love to.

112
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
 Ricky Chung film.

113
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,479
 -  Superb!
 -  Superb!

114
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,559
 -  What's this?
 -  Flower.

115
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,079
 Then I can interview Ricky Chung.

116
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
 Ricky and Bridget.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 I hate violence. Violence makes me sick.

118
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,239
 Wonderful. I totally agree, Richard.

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,278
 But I love animals.

120
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,799
 I love animals too.

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 You must come and meet my dog Charley.

122
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
 -  We have so much in common.
 -  I know.

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,279
 Hector...

124
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
 Come and sit down.
 I think we should talk.

125
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,519
 OK.

126
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 What do you want to talk about?

127
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,239
 I think we should see other people.

128
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,479
 See other people?

129
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
 But I see other people. I see Bridget,
 I see Nick, I see the postman.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 No, I mean we should...

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 see other people.

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 Fine.

133
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,799
 Guys, help me prepare
 my interview with Ricky Chung.

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 -  Bridget, it's not a good time.
 -  No, no.

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
 It is a very good time.

136
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,919
 Sit down, Bridget.

137
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,639
 -  So, you are Ricky Chung.
 -  I am Ricky Chung.

138
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 -  Yes.
 -  And who are you?

139
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,879
 I'm me, silly!

140
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,319
 So, Ricky...

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 What kind of...women do you like?

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
 Well, I like beautiful women...like you.

143
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,319
 Correct answer!

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,278
 And tell me, Ricky...

145
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,279
 Do you...have a girlfriend now?

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,360
 Well...

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,439
 Sweetie?

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 Oh, Ricky.

149
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,598
 Hector...

150
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,599
 hold this.

151
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,238
 Thanks.

152
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,239
 Now...I want you to attack me.

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 -  Attack you?
 -  Yeah.

154
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,359
 -  Not now.
 -  So when?

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
 It must be a surprise.

156
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
 -  Why?
 -  So I must always be ready.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
 Good. Very good!

158
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 I am feeling good!

159
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 I'm feeling fit!

160
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,319
 Nick, are you being violent?

161
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,638
 No.

162
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,639
 Thanks. Must go. It's my audition.

163
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,279
 OK, Nick.

164
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,238
 OK, Nick!

165
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,239
 Let's see what you can do.

166
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,599
 Excellent. Excellent.

167
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,798
 -  What?
 -  You've got the part.

168
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,799
 I have? Yes!

169
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
 Next.

170
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 Hey, baby.

171
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,599
 Nick.

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 You are looking at the new Ricky Chung.

173
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 Nick, that's wonderful.

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Ricky... Ricky Chung!

175
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,680
 What are you doing? Are you crazy?

176
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,758
 But you told me to attack you.

177
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,759
 But not now.

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 Not now!

179
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,878
 Amateurs!

180
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,359
 So...

181
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,758
 -  When can I?
 -  What?

182
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,159
 -  Meet him!
 -  Who?

183
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 Ricky Chung!

184
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,278
 But I love animals.

185
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,279
 I love animals too.

186
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
 Hector.

187
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,119
 I am feeling good.

188
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,519
 So when?

189
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,479
 Ricky Chung.

190
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
 Hi, I'm Nick.

191
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 Nick, Ricky never talks at work.

192
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Very professional.

193
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
 So what do you want me to do?

194
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 -  You just stand still.
 -  OK.

195
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,038
 Excellent.

196
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,278
 What is this?

197
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,279
 -  This is your role.
 -  But we are partners.

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,638
 Partners?

199
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,639
 Yes, we fight the criminals together.

200
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,519
 No, no, no. You play the stupid friend.

201
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
 -  The stupid friend?
 -  Exactly.

202
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,879
 Right, let's try it again.
 Ricky, action.

203
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,639
 So how was your first day with Ricky?

204
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
 Great! We get on very well.

205
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,359
 There must be so much to learn.

206
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,479
 Yeah! I taught Ricky a lot today.

207
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,879
 -  OK, Nick. Bend over.
 -  Excuse me?

208
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,438
 I said bend over.

209
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 I thought so.

210
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,558
 Hello, nurse.

211
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,559
 Could I have a bath, please?

212
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,119
 Hi, Bridget.

213
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,879
 So, when can I meet Ricky?

214
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,118
 No Ricky?

215
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,079
 No interview.

216
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,080
 No interview -  no job!

217
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,839
 Poor Nick.

218
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,038
 Nick, how are you feeling?

219
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,119
 -  Ricky!
 -  Richard?

220
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,759
 Annie?

221
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 What are you doing here?

222
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 This is Richard.
 I met him at my protest group.

223
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,839
 Ricky Chung!

224
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
 Please...please can I have an interview?

225
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,319
 Bridget, this isn't Ricky Chung,
 this is Richard.

226
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,759
 No, no, no. This is Ricky Chung.

227
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,118
 Richard?

228
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,119
 Yeah. Ricky Chung is my film name.

229
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
 But I thought you hated violence.

230
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
 You lied to me!

231
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
 Ricky!

232
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
 -  I brought you some cake.
 -  Thanks, Hector.

233
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,239
 Hector, will you forgive me?

234
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,919
 Of course.

235
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,478
 How fascinating.

236
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:06,479
 Anti- violence, and a kung fu star!

237
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 It'll make a great interview.

238
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,519
 Eunice will love it!

239
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,999
 And so will I.

240
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,239
 Next time in Extra...

241
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,679
 Charley enters a dog show.

242
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,599
 Bridget's got a new boyfriend.

243
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
 And guess who's in trouble with the police.

244
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,279
 And guess who's in trouble with the police.
