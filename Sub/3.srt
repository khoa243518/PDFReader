00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,239
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
 They have a visitor from Argentina

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 who can't speak English very well,

4
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,478
 who has no style,

5
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,878
 and who can't do the shopping.

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,879
 But he is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,079
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 Dear dream date.

9
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,919
 My name is Annie!

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 I'm 19 and I love animals,

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,559
 and...

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
 and...

13
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:35,679
 and I love chocolate.

14
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,719
 Chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake,

15
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,559
 boxes of chocolate, chocolate mousse...

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,958
 -  What are you doing, Annie?
 -  Nothing!

17
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,319
 What's this?

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,320
 'Dream date, make my dream come true!'

19
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,999
 -  Oh, how did that get there?
 -  How sweet!

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,479
 Let's go. Look left.

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,798
 Right. One, two, three, four, left.

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
 -  Hector!
 -  And right.

23
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
 -  Hector.
 -  Oh, hi, Bridget.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,279
 -  And up...
 -  And up!

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,519
 And up...and down...

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 Oh, well, keep going, Hector.

27
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,279
 Oh, I see Hector found
 Cindy's 101 Top Exercises, then.

28
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,718
 Yes!

29
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,038
 Oh, good try, Hector.

30
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,039
 But Cindy is so old- fashioned,
 I can teach Hector how to exercise!

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,239
 Exercise with Cindy, no.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,558
 Exercise with Bridget, yes!

33
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,559
 -  But...!
 -  It's OK, I can do it!

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 Music, please, Annie.

35
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,558
 Follow me.

36
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,439
 Arms up, touch your toes,

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,079
 stand straight and...

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,078
 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

39
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,518
 More energy, please!

40
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,519
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,240
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

42
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,319
 OK, faster still!

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,999
 Left leg up! Left leg up!

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,918
 Left leg up!

45
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,919
 -  Oh, my leg hurts!
 -  Come on, keep up!

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,680
 Come on, faster! Come on!

47
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,079
 Come on! Come on!

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
 Faster!

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,598
 Oh, hi, Nick.

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,599
 -  We're exercising.
 -  I can see.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
 Phew, OK. Let's get a drink!

52
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,039
 Oh, I must check my emails.

53
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,559
 -  Would you like some water, Hector?
 -  Oh, no. No, after you.

54
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,959
 -  No, you first.
 -  Oh, no, no, no. Ladies first.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,599
 -  No, no, you first.
 -  No, you first.

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,798
 Oh, give it to me!

57
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,799
 Oh, goody! Three messages.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,639
 -  Oh, dear.
 -  What's wrong?

59
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,518
 Annie's been on the Internet - again!

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,759
 The Internet?

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,760
 -  To find a boyfriend!
 -  Oh, let's see!

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,798
 -  Oh, no. Don't look.
 -  Oh, come on, Annie!

63
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,799
 Oh, all right, then.

64
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,999
 'Annie baby! Rocky the tennis star here!

65
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
 'I am the racket - will you be my ball?'

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,238
 OK, number two.

67
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,238
 Mmm.

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,239
 Erm... 'Dear Annie! I love animals too.'

69
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,359
 Mmm.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 'They are so beautiful in their glass boxes.'

71
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,679
 'Come and see them.
 Tony Green (Taxidermist).'

72
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,039
 A taxidermist! Ooh, how horrible!

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,519
 Oh, Charley! Here, boy!

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,479
 It's OK, Charley.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Annie, what is a taxidermist?

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 Erm, well, it's...

77
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,719
 It's a...

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 Ah... Oh, never mind.

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,678
 -  Third time lucky.
 -  Hope so.

80
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,679
 Hmm. 'Annie, can you cook like my mother?

81
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
 'Do you like trains? Can you meet me today?

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,278
 'Giles Smith (aged 24)

83
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,279
 'P.S. Mummy says I must be home
 before 5.00 pm.'

84
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,078
 -  Oh, dear!
 -  Oh!

85
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
 I'll never get a boyfriend!

86
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,239
 -  Bridget always has a boyfriend.
 -  Has she?

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,559
 Annie, look, it's not what you write,

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,558
 it's...it's how you write it.

89
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,038
 Huh?

90
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,039
 I bet I could get a girlfriend on the Internet,
 no problem.

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,559
 Well, yes, Nick, you could!

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
 I bet you could not!

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 I could!

94
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,558
 OK...

95
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,559
 What would you write?

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,759
 I'm six foot tall.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,278
 Five foot eleven.

98
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,279
 I have blonde hair.

99
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,599
 -  Mousy brown.
 -  I love animals.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,199
 -  Ha!
 -  And fast cars, and beautiful women.

101
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,198
 -  I would write to you!
 -  Would you?

102
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,199
 Oh, come on, Annie!

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 -  Let's go to the gym.
 -  Oh, Bridget, no! Not more exercise!

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,999
 See you later, boys.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Oh, and er, Hector,
 would you do my washing for me?

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,198
 Washing? OK.

107
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,398
 No problem.

108
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,399
 Oh, and Nick?
 Will you spray my plant for me, please?

109
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,439
 -  The spray is in the bathroom.
 -  No problem.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 -  Nick?
 -  Uh- huh?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 What is a taxidermist?

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 Oh. Well...

113
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,479
 Well, it's...

114
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,159
 Never mind.

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 Chrissy!

116
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,558
 Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

117
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,559
 More energy, please!

118
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 -  My leg hurts!
 -  Come on, keep up!

119
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,359
 Nadia.

120
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,439
 Oh, Charley! Here, boy!

121
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,718
 -  Oh, dear!
 -  Oh!

122
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,719
 I'll never get a boyfriend.

123
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,199
 Dan!

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
 I bet I could get a girlfriend on the Internet,
 no problem.

125
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,879
 Finding girlfriends on the Internet
 is so easy.

126
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,759
 OK, Hector!

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,638
 Question one.

128
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,518
 How do guys get girlfriends?

129
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,519
 -  Girlfriends?
 -  Yeah!

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 -  Girlfriends.
 -  Oh! Oh, no girlfriends, me.

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,759
 -  Never.
 -  What?

132
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 Never? No girl...no girlfriends?

133
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,199
 Wow! Man!

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
 -  You, Nick, you have had girlfriends?
 -  Yeah, loads!

135
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,719
 -  Ten?
 -  Ten? Ha!

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,359
 Hundreds!

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
 -  Wow!
 -  So I know what girls like.

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 They like fast cars,

139
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,599
 they like money,

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,639
 they like dancing.

141
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
 Oh, I love dancing!

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,918
 Like this!

143
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,919
 No, dancing like this!

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,718
 Huh? Yeah.

145
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,719
 Hector, leave it to me.

146
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,879
 Leave it to me, my friend, I have a plan!

147
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,598
 Oh, Hector, Annie's plant.

148
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,959
 Her garden spray is in the bathroom.

149
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
 Oh.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,719
 Ho- ho!

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 Garden...gar- den... Erm...

152
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,959
 Spray, garden spray.

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,158
 'Garden Romance'.

154
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,159
 Garden... good!

155
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,399
 Hmm! Perfect!

156
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
 Perfect!

157
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,238
 Cold, hot...

158
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,398
 very hot.

159
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,518
 -  Er, Nick.
 -  Uh- huh?

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,519
 Bridget's cold or hot?

161
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,638
 Ha, very hot!

162
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,639
 Ah.

163
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,119
 Perfect!

164
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
 Perfect, ha!

165
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,799
 Hector, we'll get lots of girlfriends now!

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,599
 -  Aha!
 -  From now on

167
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 it'll be girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,839
 -  Ha- ha!
 -  Yo!

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,039
 -  Ha- hey!
 -  Whoo!

170
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 Oh, you really must change your aftershave!

171
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,719
 Oh, excuse me.

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 Come on, let's go out and celebrate.

173
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,519
 What's that smell?

174
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 It smells like a perfumery.

175
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,239
 Oh, my plant!

176
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,678
 Oh, empty!

177
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,679
 Oh, my poor plant! I don't believe it!

178
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,119
 My perfume, I don't believe it!

179
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,358
 Nick!

180
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,359
 Oh, good, the washing's done.

181
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,559
 What's the problem?

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 This is the problem!

183
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
 Hector!

184
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,479
 -  Wow!
 -  What is it now?

185
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
 We have six hundred
 and thirty- three messages!

186
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,238
 Let's see.

187
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,839
 OK, one moment.

188
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,799
 'Hector! Nick! Yes! We are gorgeous!

189
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 'Yes! We like dancing!
 And yes! We like millionaires!

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,278
 'Fifi and Sara.'

191
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,279
 Chloe, Sadie, Louise, Gerri...

192
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,959
 These messages are all for Hector and Nick
 and they're all from girls!

193
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,439
 I smell a rat!

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 Hmm! And I think I know who is responsible!

195
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,719
 Oh, Bridget!

196
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 Look at this!
 'Are you a gorgeous babe?

197
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,958
 'Do you have a gorgeous friend?

198
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,878
 'Do you like fast cars and dancing all night?

199
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,759
 'Do you like millionaires?

200
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,238
 'Then you will love us - 

201
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,239
 'we are Hector and Nick - 
 the Romero brothers.'

202
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,758
 What?

203
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,759
 'See attached photo.'

204
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 Ha, cheats, they glued their photo on this car!

205
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,119
 Ha, what a joke!

206
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
 What, that's how they received six hundred
 and thirty- three messages from girls.

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 But they don't know they received six hundred
 and thirty- three messages, do they?

208
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,279
 No, they don't now.

209
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,280
 Let's go to the cybercafe.

210
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,359
 I have a plan.

211
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
 The poor computer. How many messages?

212
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,198
 One hundred!

213
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,319
 Two hundred!

214
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,919
 -  Oh.
 -  How many?

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,798
 -  Er, one.
 -  Good.

216
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,799
 -  One hundred!
 -  No, no, no, just one message.

217
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,278
 Huh?

218
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,438
 Erm...

219
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,198
 'Hector and Nick!

220
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,199
 'We are dancers in a West End musical.'

221
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,199
 Dancers, you mean...

222
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,479
 -  Dancers?
 -  Yeah, sort of.

223
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,559
 Erm... 'When we finish the show, shall we
 meet at your apartment at 10pm?

224
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,358
 'Is that OK?

225
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,359
 'Cuddles and Bubbles, kiss, kiss, kiss.

226
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,438
 'P.S. What is your address?'

227
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,398
 Wow! They sound gorgeous!

228
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,638
 Uh?

229
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,598
 Er... Ah!

230
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,478
 Ta- da!

231
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,479
 Cuddles and Bubbles...

232
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,999
 are coming here tonight

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 when they finish the show...

234
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
 at...

235
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,518
 ten o'clock!

236
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,519
 Look, seven o'clock, eight, nine, ten o'clock!

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Wait a minute! It's seven o'clock!

238
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,919
 That's just three hours!

239
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
 What am I going to wear?
 What are you going to wear?

240
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 But Nick, what about Bridget and Annie?

241
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,838
 Aha!

242
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,358
 It's not a problem!

243
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,359
 Ah- ha- ha! Yes!

244
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,319
 Nadia.

245
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 Oh, my plant!

246
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 What's the problem?

247
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 This is the problem!

248
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,599
 Hector!

249
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,159
 Cuddles and Bubbles...

250
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,279
 are coming here tonight.

251
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 So, Nick, what should I say?

252
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,759
 -  It's easy. Relax.
 -  Yeah, but you have had a hundred girlfriends.

253
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,399
 Yeah, well, when I said a hundred,
 it's actually fewer.

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,039
 Er...fifty?

255
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,318
 No.

256
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,039
 -  Forty?
 -  No.

257
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,039
 -  Thirty?
 -  No.

258
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,998
 -  Twenty?
 -  No.

259
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,919
 -  Ten?
 -  No.

260
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,478
 Five?

261
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,639
 Four?

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,958
 Three?

263
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,239
 Two?

264
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,998
 One?

265
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,999
 None?

266
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,838
 OK.

267
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
 It's OK.

268
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,119
 Hi.

269
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,319
 -  Hi!
 -  Hello, it's us.

270
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,399
 Come on up.

271
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,879
 Ooh!

272
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 So Nick, what do I say?

273
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
 OK, we need a script.

274
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,518
 Try this.

275
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,519
 Your eyes are blue, like the ocean.

276
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 Your ears are blue, like the ocean.

277
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,479
 No! Eyes, ears, ears, eyes.

278
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Oh, oh, oh, OK, OK. Er...

279
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Your eyes are blue, like the ocean.

280
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,799
 Good!

281
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 You smell of sweet...

282
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,758
 You smell of sweat...

283
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,118
 No! No...

284
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,679
 Sweet...not sweat!

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,359
 Oh, OK, OK.

286
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 OK, your hair is so soft.

287
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,119
 -  Thank you, Nick.
 -  No!

288
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
 No, her hair, her hair!

289
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,399
 Oh, her hair!

290
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,278
 Oh, oh!

291
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,279
 OK, OK.

292
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
 -  Ready?
 -  Ready.

293
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,959
 Good luck!

294
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 Oh! Cuddles and Bubbles.

295
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 But we thought you were dancers.

296
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,038
 Oh, you are dancers.

297
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,798
 Dancing...dogs!

298
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,158
 In...Woof, The Musical.

299
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,078
 Erm, come in.

300
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,079
 Come in.

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 Er, please, sit down.

302
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,279
 Sit!

303
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680
 Stick to the script.

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You smell so sweet.

305
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,319
 Your ears are...blue, like the ocean.

306
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,158
 Psst.

307
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,998
 -  Eyes, eyes!
 -  Oh!

308
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,959
 Eyes!

309
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
 Are you a millionaire?

310
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,839
 Psst, psst!

311
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 Am I a millionaire?

312
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,759
 Are you a millionaire?

313
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 Are you a millionaire?

314
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 We are millionaires!

315
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
 Good, good.

316
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
 Well, you can pay for these, then!

317
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 If you please!

318
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,679
 Your faces!

319
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680
 -  We are the dancers.
 -  From the cybercafe!

320
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 -  So you are millionaires, eh?
 -  Oh, what a trick to get girlfriends!

321
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,718
 Millionaires, very funny!

322
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,358
 With fast cars!

323
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,119
 Good trick, eh?

324
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,120
 But that is my car!

325
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,119
 You smell so sweet!

326
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,279
 And you do have beautiful eyes!

327
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,359
 Or is it ears?

328
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,559
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  I'm off!

329
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,118
 Quick! Hide, Hector! Erm, er...

330
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,119
 In the bedroom!

331
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,959
 Er, Bridget?

332
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,558
 Yes.

333
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,559
 Tell me.

334
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,599
 What is a taxidermist?

335
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,799
 Oh!

336
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,839
 Next time in Extra...

337
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,798
 Hector wants to get a job.

338
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,799
 Bridget and Annie have a surprise.

339
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,359
 And guess who's coming to dinner.

340
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,559
 And guess who's coming to dinner.

341
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 And guess who's coming to dinner.
