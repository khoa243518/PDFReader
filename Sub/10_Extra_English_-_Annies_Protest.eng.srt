1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,800
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,040
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,199
 Bridget has a job with Channel 9

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 and so does Hector, he's a reporter.

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,679
 Annie just wants to save the animals

6
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,199
 and Nick... Well, Nick is Nick.

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,399
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,998
 What?

9
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,999
 -  Nick!
 -  Who is it?

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,518
 It's me. Annie.

11
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,519
 And this is Ziggy.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,558
 -  Is Hector there?
 -  No.

13
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,559
 -  He's working tonight.
 -  Then you must help us, Nick.

14
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,519
 Take these.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 They are my babies,
 so look after them, please!

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,838
 Sure, no problem.

17
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,918
 Right. Ready, Ziggy?

18
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,919
 Come on, let's go.

19
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,159
 Hurry!

20
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,679
 Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 Bye.

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,319
 'Animals are human?'

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,319
 Annie, animals are animals.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 -  But animals are like people.
 -  Really, Annie?

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,438
 Look at this flat. How can I get ready?

26
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,439
 -  Sorry, Bridget.
 -  I have a very important day today.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 -  Sorry.
 -  I have big, big decisions to make.

28
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,439
 Like...which dress.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,199
 What do you think?

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,119
 They're both nice.

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,278
 I have such a busy morning.

32
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,279
 David Beckham, Madonna.

33
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,359
 What? You're meeting them?

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 No, I'm reading about them

35
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,239
 and then I'm having lunch with guess who.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,359
 Yes, you've guessed it.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Leonardo DiCaprio!

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 Leonardo and me!

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
 Wow! Leonardo DiCaprio?

40
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,679
 Just you and him?

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,399
 Well, nearly.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 There'll be 45 journalists there too

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,759
 but really it's just me and gorgeous Leo.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,480
 You and 45 others?

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,118
 I see.

46
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:50,119
 Anyway, this cosmetic factory
 experiments on animals for make- up

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,680
 and I really feel...

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
 Good, Hector, you're here.
 Now you can help me choose.

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,599
 You're back, Hector.

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Was it a difficult night at work,
 snuggly puppykins?

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,240
 Yes, and the bad news is
 that Eunice wants me to go straight back.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,799
 Why?

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 There is a big news story happening today.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,239
 So, Hector,

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
 which dress do you like the best?

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,879
 This one.

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,880
 -  You're sure?
 -  OK, that one.

58
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,238
 But you just said this one first.

59
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,599
 Yes, I know, but...

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 Bridget, I am going to Channel 9 now.

61
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,439
 -  Are you coming?
 -  Yes, Hector.

62
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 And I can tell you
 all about Leonardo and me!

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 The guinea pigs!

64
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,919
 Nick?

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
 Good. They're OK.

66
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 I'm coming.

67
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,119
 Ziggy, come in.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,038
 Right, now, there are the posters.

69
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,039
 Now, a note for Nick.

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
 Ready, Ziggy?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Bye, Charley. Wish us luck.

72
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,119
 Wait a minute, Ziggy.

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 OK, right, let's go.

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
 Wish us luck.

75
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,399
 Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

76
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,759
 Bye.

77
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,679
 Leonardo and me!

78
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,518
 Wow!

79
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,519
 Leonardo DiCaprio?

80
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,159
 I have big, big decisions to make.

81
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 Which dress?

82
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,559
 Hector. At last.

83
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 I want you to go
 straight to Garrier's cosmetic factory.

84
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,639
 Why?

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 Because some horrid hippies
 are protesting there.

86
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,959
 Why?

87
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Because they think Mr Garrier
 experiments on guinea pigs for make- up.

88
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,678
 This is nonsense.

89
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,079
 Guinea pigs?

90
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,119
 You know,

91
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
 guinea pigs.

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,638
 Guinea pigs! How sweet.

93
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,639
 And these hippies
 have stolen his guinea pigs.

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 Poor Mr Garrier adores his little guinea pigs.

95
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:20,359
 He wants them back.

96
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,279
 He told me over dinner last night.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,638
 Who is Mr Garrier?

98
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,639
 Mr Garrier owns Channel 9.

99
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,279
 And Mr Garrier has said

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
 we must make these protesters
 look very, very stupid.

101
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,038
 Now get going!

102
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,518
 OK, Eunice.

103
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,519
 I want their heads!

104
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,039
 Eunice?

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,198
 Yes, Bridget?

106
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,199
 Is there anything I can do?

107
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,919
 Yes.

108
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 I have a very important job for you.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Get me a coffee. Black, no sugar.

110
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,839
 No, Bridget.

111
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
 I can't, I'm a married man.

112
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,039
 What?

113
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,838
 Crazy, man!

114
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,798
 Guinea pigs!

115
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,799
 They are my babies,
 so look after them, please.

116
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,560
 Yeah, sure, no problem.

117
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,958
 Yeah.

118
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,198
 Annie.

119
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,039
 Annie!

120
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 OK, my little beauties.

121
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 Time for breakfast.

122
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,479
 Come on.

123
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 'Nick, very important. Keep my babies safe.
 I will call you. Annie.'

124
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,518
 Does she think I'm stupid?

125
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,519
 Of course you're safe with me.

126
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 Now, let me introduce myself.

127
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,278
 My name is Nick.

128
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,439
 Yeah, hello there.

129
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
 Now, what's your name?

130
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,479
 Kevin? How do you do, Kevin?

131
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,838
 And who's this?

132
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,518
 Janice?

133
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,519
 Is she your girlfriend, Kevin?

134
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,439
 OK, it's not that funny.

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 Janice, I think you're very pretty, OK?

136
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,879
 So!

137
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,319
 These are all your friends.

138
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,718
 Wow!

139
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,719
 There are eight of you.

140
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,438
 You must be hungry.

141
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,439
 Shall Uncle Nick get you
 something nice to eat?

142
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,119
 OK.

143
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,319
 Have they split up?

144
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 Hollywood's most beautiful couple.

145
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,599
 Yes!

146
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,639
 Yes!

147
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,799
 Garrier out! Garrier out!

148
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
 All right, Eunice, I cannot hear you.

149
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,238
 I said,

150
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,438
 find the leader.

151
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,439
 The what?

152
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,438
 The coordinator.

153
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,878
 Which one?

154
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,359
 Her, her! That one!

155
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 The one with the big ears.

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
 Garrier out! Garrier out!

157
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,918
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

158
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,919
 This isn't a tea party. Ask her a question.

159
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,919
 OK.

160
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
 So how important is this protest?

161
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,398
 Well...

162
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,159
 Well, yes, it's very important

163
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
 because this factory, Garrier's,
 experiments on animals for make- up.

164
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,319
 And why is that bad?

165
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,479
 Because the poor...

166
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 Because the poor animals are suffering.

167
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,119
 That's dreadful. The poor things.

168
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 Poor little things.

169
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,399
 They're just guinea pigs!

170
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,639
 Hector, remember who Mr Garrier is?

171
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,639
 You do want your job.

172
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,638
 OK, OK.

173
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,639
 OK, so do you think
 this march will help the animals?

174
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,639
 It's Hector and Annie.

175
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,078
 -  This march is important.
 -  Wow, man!

176
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,079
 We must stop Mr Garrier!

177
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,518
 I see.

178
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,519
 These scientists are using poor animals
 to test on hair dye,

179
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 lipstick, mascara, blusher.

180
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,278
 They use...

181
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,279
 Well, tell her. Tell her...we need make- up!

182
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,919
 And where are the eight guinea pigs
 they stole from the laboratory?

183
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,958
 I bet she knows. Ask her.

184
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,559
 Ask her.

185
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,319
 OK.

186
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
 And do you know anything
 about...some stolen guinea pigs?

187
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 The guinea pigs are safe.

188
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 Yeah, they're safe with me.

189
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,079
 Aren't you, my pretty ones?

190
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,919
 I bet she's got those guinea pigs.

191
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 -  Ask her! Ask her!
 -  OK.

192
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,759
 Have you...

193
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 Louder, you idiot!

194
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Have you got...

195
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,319
 We've got her! Ask her again! Ask her again!

196
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 Have you got the guinea pigs?

197
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,798
 Hector, why are you doing this?

198
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,039
 You know I love animals.

199
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 I'm sorry, Annie. It's my job.

200
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,159
 Well, you can keep your job!

201
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 Annie, please! Wait, I'm coming!

202
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,280
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

203
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,999
 Annie, please! I can explain.

204
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,279
 Wait!

205
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,879
 OK, my little beauties.

206
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,519
 They're safe with me.

207
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
 Aren't you, my pretty ones?

208
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
 Have you got the guinea pigs?

209
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 Hector, why are you doing this?

210
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,719
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

211
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,399
 Annie, please, I can explain. Wait!

212
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,839
 Bridget DiCaprio.

213
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 Mrs Leonardo DiCaprio.

214
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 Leonardo and Bridget DiCaprio.

215
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,638
 'Hello, Mrs DiCaprio!'

216
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,639
 'Call me Bridget.'

217
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,319
 'Is Leonardo there?'

218
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,719
 'No,

219
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 'he's on the beach with
 our two beautiful children and the dogs.'

220
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,639
 Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

221
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,279
 So aren't you going to ask me
 about my lunch?

222
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 -  What did you do that for?
 -  Aren't you going to ask me about my lunch?

223
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,159
 -  What lunch?
 -  My lunch with Leonardo.

224
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,879
 Leonardo who?

225
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
 Leonardo DiCaprio, of course.

226
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 So, Bridget, how was your lunch
 with Leonardo DiCaprio?

227
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,839
 Gorgeous!

228
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,279
 I was so funny.

229
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
 He loved me, he loved my dress,
 he loved my name.

230
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,079
 -  That's nice.
 -  Now close your eyes.

231
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,479
 Go on, close your eyes.

232
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 Ready?

233
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,719
 What do you think?

234
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 -  Very nice.
 -  It was very expensive

235
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 but it's worth it
 because tonight I'm going to a premiere.

236
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,199
 I can't wait!

237
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
 I wonder if Leonardo will be there.
 Now I must get ready.

238
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,359
 Tonight this little lady's going to shine

239
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,679
 Tonight this little lady's going to shine

240
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,319
 Annie, I can explain. Listen.

241
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,759
 Annie, please talk to me.

242
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,080
 Hey, guys. Great interview.

243
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,839
 You were not fair, Hector.

244
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,840
 -  You were asking awful questions.
 -  Yeah, they were pretty bad.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,678
 It wasn't me.

246
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,679
 It was Eunice.

247
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,278
 The guinea pigs!

248
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,279
 Nick, where are they?
 I must take them to the animal sanctuary.

249
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,039
 We've been having a lovely time,
 haven't we, my friends?

250
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 Hello. They're not here.

251
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,279
 What do you mean, they're not here?

252
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 I mean, they're not here.

253
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
 So where are they, Nick?

254
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,039
 Everywhere?

255
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,559
 I'll get it.

256
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,479
 Hello.

257
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
 Hi, Eunice.

258
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 Yes, Eunice.

259
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,438
 OK, Eunice.

260
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,079
 No, Eunice.

261
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 OK, Eunice. Bye, Eunice.

262
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:30,118
 -  It was Eunice!
 -  No!

263
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,119
 And after what happened today,

264
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,238
 she says that I...

265
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,558
 Hector!

266
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:37,559
 Your job! She's fired you!

267
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,759
 I'm so sorry, Hector.

268
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,998
 It's all my fault.

269
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,999
 She says that I must tell you

270
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,559
 that she is so pleased with the interview,

271
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 she wants Channel 9
 to fight against animal cruelty.

272
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,759
 Channel 9's new motto is...

273
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 Animals are human.

274
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,599
 That's fantastic news!

275
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 Good old Eunice.

276
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,638
 What about Mr Garrier?

277
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,639
 She said, 'Don't worry about Mr Garrier.'

278
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 -  Right, let's find those guinea pigs.
 -  Yes, right away.

279
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,079
 Right, we've found seven of them.

280
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,998
 There's just one guinea pig still missing.

281
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,639
 He's probably watching us.

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,640
 Yeah, and laughing at us.

283
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,958
 Hello?

284
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,959
 OK, right.

285
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,279
 -  Bridget, your taxi's here.
 -  I'm coming.

286
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 New girlfriend, Nick?

287
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,719
 Right, everyone,

288
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,679
 I'm just off to my premiere.

289
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,478
 Did I mention it?

290
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,519
 Proper acting.

291
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 Perhaps you could learn something, Nick.

292
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,599
 Sorry.

293
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,798
 No spare ticket.

294
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,799
 Still, I'll tell you all about it later.

295
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
 Bye.

296
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
 Don't wait up.

297
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,559
 Next time in Extra...

298
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
 The friends go on holiday to Spain.

299
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,679
 Bridget finds her prince.

300
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,438
 And Nick finds his princess.

301
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:37,438
 And Nick finds his princess.
