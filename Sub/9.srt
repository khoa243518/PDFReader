1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,680
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
 Hector and Annie are dating

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,559
 and Hector's English
 is getting better and better.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,519
 Nick fancies Bridget

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,520
 but...well, Bridget does not fancy Nick.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,799
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 To be or not to be,

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
 that is the question. Whe...

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,840
 Oh, no!

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Why is it so dark in here? What's going on?

12
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,799
 Nick, what are you doing?
 The sun is shining outside.

13
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,719
 Hi, Annie.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 -  What are you doing?
 -  Nothing.

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,319
 -  Well, stand up, then.
 -  I can't.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,878
 Why not?

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,879
 -  Right, I'm coming over.
 -  OK.

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
 OK.

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,718
 Nice outfit, Nick!

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,719
 Bridget, look at this!

21
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,879
 You can laugh

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
 but one day I will be a great actor.

23
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,999
 In fact, I might get a part
 in a Shakespeare production this week.

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,438
 In your dreams!

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,638
 Did you have a good day at work, Bridget?

26
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,639
 I'm so tired.

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,160
 Training with the England
 football team this morning.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
 Those boys...so cheeky!

29
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,319
 But they really know
 what they're talking about.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,759
 Football?

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 No. Hairstyles and fashion, of course.

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 Anyway, then I had lunch
 with Kylie Minogue's agent...lovely man.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 -  So funny! I'm exhausted.
 -  Poor Bridget.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 I must get changed.

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 Now Bridget's a researcher for Channel 9,
 all she talks about is sweet stars.

36
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,559
 It's so boring.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 I'll be sweet when I'm famous.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,560
 Where are they?

39
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
 I thought so.

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
 To die...to sleep...

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 -  Nick!
 -  No more...

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 -  Are those my tights?
 -  No.

43
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,958
 Yes, they are!

44
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,798
 These tights! Are they yours, Bridget?

45
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,799
 I'll speak to you later.
 Now, where's Hector?

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,280
 I have some exciting news for him.

47
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,038
 Hi, Bridget.

48
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,638
 Hi, sugar plum!

49
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,639
 Hi, snuggly puppykins!

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 Nice tights, man!

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 Hector, I have some great news for you.

52
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,599
 Channel 9 is looking
 for a television reporter.

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,839
 I can do that!

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,840
 Not an English reporter.
 A Latin American who speaks English.

55
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,999
 -  But I can't speak English very well.
 -  Just audition.

56
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,239
 Go on, Hector, the camera will love you.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 And so will the girls!

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,239
 Not all the girls, I hope.

59
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Well, if you think so, then...

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 Hector, with my help, the job is yours.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 And my new boss
 will be very impressed with me.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,799
 OK, Bridget.

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 Right! Let's do some research.

64
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,159
 Annie, we need CNN. Find it. And, Nick?

65
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 -  Yes?
 -  I want my tights back...now.

66
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,479
 OK.

67
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,558
 You want your tights back?

68
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,959
 They are Versace.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
 The remote, please, Annie.

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 Alas, poor Yorick.

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,639
 I knew him, Horatio.

72
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,278
 What's wrong with it?

73
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,279
 I don't know. I think it's broken.

74
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 Well, we'll have to go to your place, then.

75
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,479
 There you are.

76
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,158
 We're watching CNN.

77
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,159
 We're doing research for Hector's new job.

78
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,639
 Hector's new job? What about my new job?
 I need to do research as well.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 Nick!

80
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,758
 There! That's better.

81
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,158
 To be or not to be...

82
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,159
 -  What's this?
 -  Hamlet. A tragedy.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,398
 What's it about?

84
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,399
 Love, madness and murder.

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 Hamlet's father, the king,
 is killed by Hamlet's uncle,

86
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,719
 who then marries...

87
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:09,959
 Hamlet's mother,

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
 so Hamlet kills his uncle and his mother

89
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,399
 and then...he dies.

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,318
 That sounds like my family.

91
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,919
 It's a masterpiece.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 I'd be great as Hamlet.

93
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,158
 My tights!

94
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,159
 Bridget, I had an accident.

95
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,599
 Buy me another pair
 or you will have an accident!

96
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,319
 Accident or murder?

97
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,679
 OK, Bridget.

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,798
 Right, I'm off.

99
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,799
 Me too.

100
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 -  Good night, sugar plum.
 -  Night, snuggly puppykins.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,279
 Nick, I am worried.

102
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 Hector, I know what you mean.

103
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,599
 When women talk like that,
 it is time to move on.

104
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,239
 No, not Annie. This television reporter's job.

105
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,279
 I don't really think I can do it.

106
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
 Hector, of course you can.

107
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,519
 What you need is...

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
 -  Talent?
 -  No! You don't need talent.

109
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,079
 You need Nick's School
 For Television Reporters.

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Nick's School For Television Reporters?

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 Yeah! I will teach you
 to be a television reporter.

112
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,238
 -  OK!
 -  OK.

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,759
 Rule number one.

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 Imagine you are talking
 to a beautiful woman.

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
 Good evening, this is Nick Jessop

116
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,079
 reporting from the Houses of Parliament
 just for you.

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
 Rule number two. Be mysterious.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I am here to tell you
 the Houses of Parliament may look normal,

119
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,879
 but all is not as it seems.

120
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,478
 Rule number three.

121
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,479
 Make them trust you.

122
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,599
 I can reveal that this building

123
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 is actually an alien space station.

124
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,639
 Trust me. Trust Nick Jessop.

125
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,159
 I will always tell you the truth.

126
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,599
 See you later. Good night and...sleep tight.

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 Do it like that, Hector,
 and you will get the job.

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
 Hi, this is Hector Romero.

129
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
 Well, if you think so.

130
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,319
 OK, Bridget.

131
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,239
 These tights!

132
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
 To die...to sleep...

133
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Nick's School For Television Reporters.

134
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,039
 Did you get my fax?

135
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 Well, did you get my email?

136
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,079
 What did Sting say?
 Will he do the interview?

137
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,919
 You won't even ask him?

138
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,079
 He's never heard of Channel 9?

139
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 Please! Please!

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,798
 Please!

141
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,799
 Well, can I meet him?

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,798
 I can?

143
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,598
 Where is he?

144
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,599
 At the airport? I'll be there.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,998
 Yes!

146
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,758
 Hector Romero for you, Bridget.

147
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,238
 No.

148
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,239
 Hector, I forgot your audition.

149
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 Listen, I must go out for one hour.
 Sting wants to see me.

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,758
 Don't worry.

151
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,558
 Just remember everything I've told you.

152
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,559
 Here's the script, there's the camera.

153
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,758
 Must dash! Be back in an hour!

154
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,759
 But...

155
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,279
 Hello. This is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,478
 What a day!

157
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,479
 First Sting had already departed
 for New York and now this!

158
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,719
 This! From you, Hector!

159
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,158
 Sorry, Bridget.

160
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
 Was this Nick's idea?

161
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,039
 I thought so.

162
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
 So, have I got the job?

163
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,599
 What do you think?

164
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Goodbye, Hector.

165
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:36,319
 And the new editor will be here soon.

166
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,519
 Right! Nick!

167
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,999
 'Nick, I am too angry to speak. Bridget.'

168
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,318
 -  Hi, Bridget!
 -  Nick.

169
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,758
 I thought you were too angry
 to speak to me.

170
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,759
 Shut up, Nick. How dare you?

171
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,958
 How dare I what?

172
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
 Teach Hector to be a news reporter!

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
 -  Sorry, Bridget.
 -  He was ridiculous.

174
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,239
 'Hi, sexy, this is Hector Romero.'

175
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,919
 My new editor will be here soon
 and I wanted to impress her.

176
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,079
 So will Hector get the job, then?

177
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,279
 Of course he won't get the job.
 You made me look a fool.

178
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,799
 You...you and Hector are so stupid!

179
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,919
 Who was that?

180
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
 -  Wrong number.
 -  Nick, look at this.

181
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,079
 -  This could be perfect for you.
 -  What is it?

182
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,279
 'Is Shakespeare in your blood?
 Could you be our Hamlet?'

183
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,878
 Yeah!

184
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,599
 -  'Do you love performing?'
 -  Yeah!

185
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,958
 -  'Do you love travelling?'
 -  Yeah!

186
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,959
 -  'Do people adore you?'
 -  Naturally!

187
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 'Then we need you. Call this number
 for a Shakespearean experience.'

188
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,118
 Hamlet!

189
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,119
 My dream!

190
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,079
 I'll call now.

191
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
 I must learn my lines.

192
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,319
 To be...

193
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
 To be...

194
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 Or not to be?

195
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 Hello, Bridget.

196
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,439
 Eunice! What are you doing here?

197
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 Long time no see, Bridget.

198
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 And how's Nick? Does he miss me?

199
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
 No... Yes.

200
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 You have a new hairstyle.

201
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:26,439
 Yeah. So have you.

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 Yes, but the difference is mine looks good.

203
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,679
 Yes.

204
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
 Anyway, Bridget,

205
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
 I am your new editor.

206
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,199
 Surprised?

207
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 No...no...no.

208
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,358
 Good.

209
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,359
 OK. Two rules.

210
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 One. I am your editor and I am always right.

211
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
 Two. You are the researcher,
 you are always wrong. OK?

212
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,558
 OK.

213
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,559
 Now, what have you got for me today?

214
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 Well, Sting would love
 to come for an interview but...

215
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,479
 But is not coming.

216
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,518
 No.

217
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,519
 But we need a new reporter and...

218
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,479
 and...

219
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 and I have found you
 the most perfect person.

220
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,399
 He's Latin American, speaks English
 and he's very sexy.

221
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,199
 Watch this. I know you'll love him.

222
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Hi, sexy. This is Hector Romero
 for Channel 9.

223
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 Wow, you look beautiful today.

224
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
 Guess what. There's been
 a diamond robbery in London.

225
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,319
 I would love to put diamonds
 on those pretty ears.

226
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,119
 But you, yes, you can sleep safely
 in your bed tonight.

227
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 This is Hector Romero.

228
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 I'll be back.

229
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,239
 Well?

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 Of course! Hector! He is perfect!

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
 Hello, this is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

232
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 Right! Nick!

233
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,399
 I am your new editor.

234
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,399
 He is perfect!

235
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,119
 My dream!

236
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,159
 Don't worry, Hector, my little puppykins.

237
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
 I'm sure you would have been
 a very good reporter.

238
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 But Bridget is angry with me.

239
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 Don't worry about Bridget.

240
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 Guess what. I've got the job.

241
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,438
 -  Hamlet?
 -  Shakespeare?

242
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,439
 Congratulations, man!

243
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,558
 Great! When do you start?

244
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,559
 Tonight. I've got the costume already.

245
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 I think I will go and wash my motorbike.

246
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,079
 You haven't got a motorbike.

247
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 -  I have now.
 -  Hi, everyone!

248
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 Hector, you have a visitor.

249
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,439
 My new editor.

250
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,519
 Eunice, do you remember Hector?

251
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,839
 How could I forget?

252
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
 And...of course...Nick!

253
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,678
 I could never forget you!

254
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,679
 I thought you had a motorbike to wash.

255
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,919
 Thank you.

256
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,719
 Hector,

257
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 I just popped in to say congratulations.

258
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,038
 You've got the job!

259
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,078
 Isn't it wonderful?

260
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,479
 Eunice really liked your tape.

261
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 -  You are perfect, Hector.
 -  Hector will have such fun.

262
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
 I'm off. See you at eight o'clock sharp
 tomorrow morning, Hector.

263
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,279
 There's no need to thank me, Hector.

264
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,479
 I think I've got something in my eye.

265
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 Well, it was nice while it lasted

266
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,079
 but now, Annie, it is time
 to say goodbye to Hector.

267
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:23,199
 He is going to be a famous news reporter,

268
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,239
 so there'll be no room for little old you.

269
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,318
 It's OK, Annie.

270
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,319
 Whatever happens,
 we will always be together.

271
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,840
 But you'll forget me
 when you're a famous news reporter.

272
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
 However many stories I report,

273
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 murders, bank robberies, small cats in trees,

274
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,959
 I shall never forget you.

275
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
 You, light of my life.

276
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 This is Hector Romero
 for Channel 9, London.

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,039
 Oh, Hector!

278
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,118
 Oh, Annie!

279
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,119
 Oh, no.

280
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 -  Nick?
 -  Yes? No!

281
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 'To eat or not to eat,

282
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,439
 'that is the question.

283
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,519
 'Hamlet's burgers,
 eat them without question.'

284
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,798
 Next time in Extra...

285
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,799
 Annie wants to save the animals.

286
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,959
 Bridget has a date with Leonardo DiCaprio.

287
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,798
 And what is in Nick's box?

288
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,839
 Extra. Don't miss it.

289
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:15,839
 Extra. Don't miss it.
