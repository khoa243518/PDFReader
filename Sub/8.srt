00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,439
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,439
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
 Bridget is interested in Hector

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 but Hector is very interested in Annie.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,438
 Annie doesn't know.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,439
 So will he get close enough to tell her?

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 Find out in Extra.

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,438
 'Dear tenants,

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
 'my cousin, your landlady,
 is on holiday this week,

10
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,759
 'so I am in charge.

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,839
 'The same rules apply.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 'No pets, no parties, no visitors, especially boys.

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,079
 'Yours, Eunice Mountain.'

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,080
 Eunice Mountain? She sounds terrible.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,358
 Worse than the tarantula.

16
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,999
 If that's possible.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Do you think she'll say no shelves?

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
 She can't. They'll look fantastic.

19
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,199
 'The timber shelves
 in clear lacquered beech veneer...'

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,678
 'With six casters...'

21
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,679
 'And a TV bench.'

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 Now, where shall we begin?

23
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,958
 Annie, it's easy.

24
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,959
 Rule number one.
 Always read the instructions first.

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
 Well, that will only take a week.

26
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,279
 OK, let's have a drink before we begin.

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,039
 -  Milk, Annie?
 -  Yes, please.

28
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,078
 'I owe you, Nick.'

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,079
 There! Well, no milk.
 Would you like some sparkling water?

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
 Right.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 'I owe you, Nick.'

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 'I owe you, Nick.'

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,758
 'I owe you, Nick.'

34
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,759
 How dare he?

35
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,279
 -  Would you like some cola?
 -  Thanks, Bridget, I was looking for that.

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,638
 Nick!

37
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,639
 Sorry.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 Add it to the list.

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
 Or ask your flatmate to buy your food.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,358
 Wow!

41
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,359
 -  You didn't know Hector was rich?
 -  No.

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 I'll speak to you later.

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,918
 Wow.

44
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,759
 What are all these boxes?

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,679
 Our new shelves, Hector.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
 I can help you build them.
 Where are the instructions?

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,038
 Hector, my friend, rule number one.

48
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,039
 Never read the instructions.

49
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,479
 I see you have a note
 from our new landlady, then.

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,279
 Eunice Mountain.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
 Eunice Mountain. I bet she's the same size.

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,880
 Hello. It's Eunice Mountain.

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
 Who am I? I'm Nick, from Flat B.

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
 You want Flat A? This is...

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 Hello. Yes, this is Flat A.

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 Yes, I am Nick from Flat B.

57
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,879
 Yes, I know this isn't my flat.

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 I want to see you downstairs now.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Sorry. OK. Right away.

60
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,799
 Well?

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 Eunice Mountain
 wants to see me downstairs now.

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,038
 Bad luck, man.

63
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,119
 Oh, dear.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
 Ask her if she has any milk, bread and biscuits.

65
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,718
 OK, so...

66
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,719
 'First open box A
 and take out shelf number one.'

67
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,399
 But which is box A?

68
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,438
 This is box C.

69
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,439
 And I've got box D.

70
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,640
 I've got it. This is shelf number one.

71
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,639
 No, Hector. This is shelf number one.

72
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,519
 No, this is shelf number one.

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
 This is a nightmare.

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 OK, Annie, read out the instructions.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 'Put shelf one against the wall.'

76
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,479
 Hector, I think the books will fall off.

77
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,279
 So what's Eunice Mountain like?

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,478
 You know, not bad.

79
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,478
 Are you in trouble?

80
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,799
 Probably.

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,278
 I've got it.

82
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,279
 'Put pole B on the left and pole A on the right

83
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,399
 'and the shelf on top.' Bridget.

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 Like this, Hector?

85
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,479
 Have you put up shelves before, Hector?

86
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,319
 Many times.

87
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,999
 Or do your servants do it for you?

88
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,839
 -  I'll do it!
 -  No, no, no, I'll do it.

89
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
 Drop! Drop!

90
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:21,119
 I laugh at instructions.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,038
 That was clever.

92
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,039
 It's OK. I can straighten it.

93
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 Stand back and watch the master at work.

94
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
 Well done, Nick.

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
 So where does this piece go?

96
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,518
 Hi.

97
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,519
 I'm Eunice Mountain, your new landlady.

98
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
 Wow!

99
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 Hi.

100
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 Hello. I...

101
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,359
 I am Bridget

102
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,958
 and this is Annie.

103
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,999
 Hello.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And this is Hector from Argentina.

105
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
 Well, hello, Hector.

106
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,319
 Hector lives next door with Nick.

107
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 I've met Nick already, haven't I, Nick?

108
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,559
 Yes, that's right.

109
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 We need to talk about your rent. In private.

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 Great.

111
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,479
 'Measure the distance between the shelves.'

112
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 Annie, hold this, please.

113
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,119
 That's it.

114
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,120
 And this should be it.

115
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,919
 Hector, do you think that's correct?

116
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,559
 These shelves are for mice.

117
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 Can I speak to you please, Hector?

118
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,558
 So, Hector.

119
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,559
 'One of the richest families
 in Argentina, the Romero family.'

120
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 There you are, Hector.

121
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
 So why the secret?

122
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 Because I wanted you to like me,
 not my money.

123
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
 Oh, Hector, of course I do.

124
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,878
 Who else knows?

125
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,198
 Nick.

126
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,039
 I thought so.

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
 But not Annie. Don't tell Annie...yet.

128
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,918
 Why, Hector?

129
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,478
 Because, Bridget...

130
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:44,039
 -  Because...
 -  Yes?

131
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
 I am in love with Annie.

132
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 Nick has entered the building.

133
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
 So where are you going,
 looking like John Travolta?

134
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 He has a date with me, haven't you, darling?

135
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,998
 Another date?

136
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,999
 But that's three times this week.

137
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,718
 Four.

138
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,719
 We've been to dinner,
 to the theatre, to the cinema

139
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,559
 and last night...salsa dancing.

140
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,879
 Can you salsa?

141
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 I am the salsa queen.

142
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,879
 Yeah, with two left feet.

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,398
 -  Pardon?
 -  Nothing.

144
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,358
 It sounds great.

145
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,359
 What is it tonight? Ping- pong?

146
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Tonight's it's karaoke.

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,518
 And I am the karaoke queen.

148
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,318
 Let's go. Bye.

149
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,319
 I love you!

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 I am the karaoke queen.

151
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,639
 I bet she sings like a toad.

152
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 So, Hector, where were we?

153
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
 OK, I think I've got it, Annie.

154
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 I did knock, but the music was so loud,
 you didn't hear me.

155
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 I thought we'd have a little chat.

156
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 Rule number two. No underwear on the radiator.

157
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,558
 It's dry now.

158
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,559
 Give it to me. Give it to...

159
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,479
 Thank you.

160
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,319
 Let me repeat the rules.

161
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
 No parties and no visitors.

162
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,799
 Especially boys.

163
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 Especially boys from next door.

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 Especially Nick.

165
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 He's mine.

166
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,998
 Get the message?

167
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,999
 Yeah, we get the message.

168
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,079
 See you later.

169
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 By the way, that shelf is not straight.

170
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,639
 Bye.

171
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,518
 Well, I have never...

172
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,519
 What does she... Who does she think she is?

173
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,799
 The landlady's cousin?

174
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 I know that, but no Hector and no Nick?

175
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,359
 How dare she?

176
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,479
 How is Eunice?

177
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 Problems?

178
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 She is very nice.

179
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,318
 But?

180
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:25,319
 But she's just not my type.

181
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,759
 What do you mean?

182
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 Look. Presents.

183
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,519
 More presents. Flowers.
 More presents. Chocolate.

184
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,839
 And her energy. I'm exhausted.

185
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
 Nick?

186
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,878
 Let's go dancing.

187
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,879
 Hector, get rid of her!

188
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,158
 Get rid of her? How?

189
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,159
 -  Say something.
 -  What shall I say?

190
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
 Anything! Tell her I'm not well.

191
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,039
 I've eaten a hedgehog. I've gone to the moon.

192
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,959
 Nick, are you in there?

193
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
 -  Go on!
 -  OK.

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,438
 Hi.

195
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
 You're not Nick.

196
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 No. Nick's hedgehog has gone to the moon.

197
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,839
 Pardon?

198
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 Nick's hedgehog is not well. Nick is sad.

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,798
 So he must come dancing to make him happy.

200
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,799
 No! He cannot dance!

201
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,919
 Why not?

202
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920
 He stood on the hedgehog without shoes.
 Very painful.

203
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
 Oh! Very messy.

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,438
 So he cannot dance.

205
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,439
 Oh, that's a pity.

206
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,039
 Well, never mind.

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,040
 Yeah, sorry. Bye.

208
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,198
 -  You'll just have to come instead.
 -  Pardon?

209
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,199
 Come on, let's dance.

210
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
 Do you think that's correct?

211
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
 'And tighten the screws.'

212
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,479
 Annie, you are a genius.

213
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,319
 -  Hi, Hector.
 -  Hi, Annie.

214
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,320
 What's the matter? Are you OK?

215
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,479
 I am exhausted.

216
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,278
 What happened?

217
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,279
 -  Last night Eunice and I...
 -  Yes?

218
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,880
 -  She made me...
 -  Yes?

219
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,440
 ..go dancing.

220
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
 Annie, she dances like a rhinoceros.

221
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,759
 Wow!

222
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,118
 Annie! The shelves!

223
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,158
 You finished them!

224
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,678
 Oh, just a bit more measuring.

225
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,679
 I will help you.

226
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 -  Sorry.
 -  No, sorry.

227
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,398
 Sorry.

228
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,399
 It's OK.
 It happens when people work together.

229
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
 So, where were we?

230
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
 'For the final shelf, take...'

231
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,079
 Hector!

232
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 Help! Hide me!

233
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,278
 -  Eunice?
 -  Eunice.

234
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,159
 Oh, Bridget, save me.

235
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,160
 -  Why?
 -  It's Eunice.

236
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 Nick? Oh, Nick.

237
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,639
 There she is. She's too much.

238
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,319
 I know you are in there, Nick.

239
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 Bridget, Annie, I said no boys.

240
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,919
 Shall I get rid of her, Nick?

241
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 Yes, please. But how?

242
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,359
 I'll think of something.
 Annie, let Miss Mountain in.

243
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There you are, Nick.

244
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,319
 And Hector.

245
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Bridget, I thought I said no boys.

246
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,519
 Yes, you did.

247
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
 Especially boys from next door.

248
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,079
 Yes. Yes, you did.

249
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080
 -  Especially...
 -  Nick. He's mine.

250
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,239
 Oh, Nick!

251
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Well, I... Just wait until I tell my cousin.

252
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 By the way, Hector, I've got a fax for you.

253
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,079
 Please, give it to me.

254
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,878
 It's from your father. It says...

255
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,879
 'Coming to London to meet...
 the Prime Minister?

256
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,599
 'My jet arrives at midday. Will phone. Father.'

257
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,119
 Actually, Hector, I think you're more my type.

258
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,119
 I don't think so, Eunice.

259
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,039
 -  Goodbye.
 -  And don't slam the...door.

260
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,359
 So, Hector, your father is flying to London
 in his private jet to meet the Prime Minister?

261
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 Well, they are one of the richest families
 in Argentina.

262
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,999
 -  So, Bridget, where were we?
 -  No, Nick.

263
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,999
 The trick worked. Eunice has gone.

264
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,719
 Annie, I will buy you a million shelves.

265
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
 Well, we'd better
 start measuring for them, then.

266
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,278
 Next time in Extra...

267
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,158
 Nick dresses up.

268
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,998
 Bridget is working hard in television.

269
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,999
 And Hector goes for an audition.

270
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:55,998
 And Hector goes for an audition.
