00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,439
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector, from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,760
 Annie and Hector have decided
 not to get married.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 Bridget and Nick are dating,
 but Nick is getting bored,

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,559
 so will it last?

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,560
 Find out in Extra.

7
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,998
 Oh, Bridget...

8
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,399
 this is wonderful.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,038
 I'm so glad you like it, Nick.

10
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,039
 I just can't get enough.
 I want more, more, more!

11
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,999
 Nick, honey,
 there's plenty more where that came from.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 -  Nick?
 -  Yes, Bridget darling?

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,759
 -  How long have we been together now?
 -  Erm...

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
 We've been together two days, Nick.

15
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,919
 Wow! That long? Hmm!

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 Yes, it is a long time, Nick.

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 But if...we are to...

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 continue our relationship,

19
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,639
 you must...

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,758
 Will you...?

21
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,759
 Will you treat me like a lady?

22
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,039
 Bridget darling, just call me Gentleman Nick.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
 Nick! Nick!

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 You must... There must be more...

25
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,919
 Snogging!

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 There must be more respect.

27
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,159
 Oh, Nick.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,918
 Let's see what sort of gentleman you are.

29
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,919
 Here's a little test. Follow me.

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 -  Well?
 -  Well, what?

31
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,799
 I want to go out.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 -  Oh.
 -  So...

33
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,878
 -  What do you do?
 -  Oh!

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,679
 -  Kiss you goodbye!
 -  No.

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,199
 You open the door for me.

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,238
 Huh? Ah!

37
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,239
 Because I am the strongest!

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 Rahr! Rahr! Tarzan!

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Oh, come on, Ziggy, we'll be late.

40
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,199
 Is just you and Ziggy doing this protest?

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Yes, but when other people see how important
 it is, they'll join us. We must stop...

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,279
 Oh, excuse me, Annie.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 -  Problems?
 -  What? Oh, no, no, no.

44
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,079
 -  No problems at all.
 -  Oh, look! There's Ziggy. Must dash.

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
 -  Have fun!
 -  This is not fun. This is serious.

46
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,839
 This is serious too.

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,158
 Now, clothes.

48
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:18,198
 What?

49
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,199
 I want you more...like David Beckham.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
 Ah, like this!

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,758
 Now, where is it?

52
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,879
 Aha! Here it is.

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 Now, come here.

54
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,759
 -  Really, Bridget, I don't think...
 -  Oh, don't be silly, Nick.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
 There! That's better.

56
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,279
 Now, we must go deeper.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,678
 There is a bigger problem.

58
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,679
 You have a lot of anger in there.

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 Well, yes, I am wearing this stupid hair band.

60
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,599
 So, we must work on your inner calm.

61
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,439
 I want to see your chest.

62
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,238
 OK!

63
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,239
 Lie down.

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,118
 Close your eyes...

65
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,038
 and relax.

66
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,879
 Ahhh!

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 Now, this may tickle a bit.

68
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
 -  Ready?
 -  Yeah.

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 Here goes!

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 Just feel that anger go!

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
 Acupuncture never fails.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
 -  Oh, hi, Mrs Romero.
 -  Hello, Bridget. Where is Hector?

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,359
 Hello, Mrs Romero.

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
 Do you remember Nick, Mrs Romero?

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Time to party!

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
 I can't forget him.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,839
 Oh! Hola, Mama!

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,878
 Sorry I'm late.

79
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,879
 -  Coffee?
 -  Oh, yes, please.

80
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,839
 Excuse us, Mrs Romero.

81
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,039
 Come on, Nick, I'm taking you shopping.

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 -  Uh- uh.
 -  Oh? So you want some more acupuncture?

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,519
 OK, OK, I'm coming, I'm coming.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 And don't forget your money.

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,798
 Rahr! Rahr!

86
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,799
 Oh, you are learning quickly.

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 I want you more like David Beckham.

88
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,960
 Ah, like this?

89
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,439
 Wow! That long? Hmm!

90
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,319
 Oh! You are learning quickly!

91
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 Oh, oh, oh, oh!
 Mother, when in London, we speak English.

92
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,039
 Yes, we must. English is the language
 of high class, so I must teach it...

93
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,799
 Learn.

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 -  You must learn it, not teach it.
 -  Oh, yes.

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 So your father has found you a wife.

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 He told me. He must stop shopping on eBay.

97
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,039
 Look, Mum, I don't want a wife.

98
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,638
 I've got Annie.

99
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,639
 This girl is from a good family.

100
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
 -  So is Annie.
 -  This girl is rich.

101
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,439
 I don't care about money.

102
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,479
 But she's almost royalty.

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 Mum, Annie is my princess.

104
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,598
 But she's so...

105
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,599
 She's so clever, so kind, so happy!

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 -  Annie?
 -  Very happy!

107
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,439
 What happened?

108
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 Ziggy and I were in a field lying down.

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,158
 Sunbathing?

110
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,159
 -  Protesting.
 -  And...?

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 It began to rain!

112
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 Oh, poor Annie.

113
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,078
 Don't touch her!

114
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,079
 Now, listen, Mum, I've told you I love Annie.

115
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,598
 Be careful, your pullover.

116
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,358
 Hector, your mother's right.

117
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,359
 Don't touch me!

118
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,279
 Why did you do that?

119
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 Because I love you, darling.

120
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,799
 If you knew Annie, you would love her.

121
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
 Well, I'm going home tomorrow.

122
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,719
 Look, Mum, come to dinner tonight
 and you will meet the real Annie.

123
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 And if you don't like her, then...

124
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:40,319
 then I might marry the princess Dad has found.

125
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,239
 Annie?

126
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,879
 -  Annie.
 -  Yes, Hector?

127
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,679
 -  Can we talk?
 -  If that's OK with your mother.

128
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,239
 Oh, Annie, she's gone to her hotel now.

129
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,759
 Look, she's going home tomorrow

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 and I thought
 we would invite her to dinner tonight.

131
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,798
 Well, I'm going out.

132
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,799
 Annie, please don't be silly.
 Stay and be nice to her.

133
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,599
 She is OK, really.

134
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 Well, OK then.

135
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,839
 But you must do one thing for me.

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
 Sure. What?

137
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 -  Scrub my back.
 -  Oh, but I am still dressed.

138
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 So am I. Well, I can't put these
 in the washing machine. They're filthy.

139
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,358
 Apricot?

140
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,359
 No. Annie, will you behave?

141
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 -  When?
 -  When my mother comes to dinner.

142
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,759
 Probably.

143
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 Strawberry.

144
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
 Annie, I have an idea.

145
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 Nick is pretending to be someone different.

146
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 Nick isn't pretending. This is the new Nick.
 Isn't it, Nick?

147
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,439
 You can pretend as well.

148
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 What, Princess Caroline of Monaco?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Look, Nick is pretending
 to be what Bridget wants.

151
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:25,359
 Yeah, a slave.

152
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
 How can I help?
 As you can see, I'm a talented stylist.

153
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 Could I have some more cola, please, sweetie?

154
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,479
 My mother is coming to dinner tonight.

155
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,518
 Oh! So what's on the menu?

156
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,959
 I am!

157
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
 What sort of food does your mother like?

158
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,879
 Babies on toast?

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 I don't know. A traditional English dish.

160
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,199
 I am not going to pretend to eat meat.

161
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,520
 How about roast Annie?

162
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 I know.
 What about sweet and sour prawn balls?

163
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,759
 -  Sweet for me...
 -  And sour for Hector's mum!

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,319
 Nick, behave.

165
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
 Very funny.

166
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,999
 I will cook dinner.

167
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And Nick will look after your mother
 because he's such a gentleman now.

168
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,920
 Don't you worry about Mrs R.
 She'll have a great time.

169
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 Leave it to me.

170
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,759
 So, Annie, will you pretend?

171
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,998
 OK, Hector.

172
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,999
 For you, tonight,
 I will pretend to be the perfect girlfriend.

173
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,918
 Annie,

174
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,919
 you and I are going shopping.

175
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 Too obvious.

176
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 Too Margaret Thatcher.

177
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,039
 Hector will love it, but, no.

178
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,599
 Perfect!

179
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,039
 Don't touch her!

180
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 Your mother's right. Don't touch me!

181
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,479
 -  No!
 -  You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

182
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 What? Princess Caroline of Monaco?

183
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 Perfect!

184
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,440
 Yeah, a slave.

185
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,758
 Wow! Annie!

186
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,799
 You look great.

187
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 I look 45 years old.

188
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:14,719
 But my mother will like it.

189
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,359
 Snap!

190
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,639
 Versace?

191
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
 Marks and Spencer's.

192
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
 Have you enjoyed your visit to London,
 Mrs Romero?

193
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,438
 I love London.

194
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,439
 We often visit our friends, Liz and Phil.

195
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,279
 And where do they live?

196
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,438
 Buckingham Palace.

197
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,439
 There you are, Mrs Romero.

198
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 Oh, you are so handsome, Nick.

199
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 Annie has had an interesting day today, haven't
 you, Annie?

200
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
 Go on, Annie,
 tell Mother about your interesting day.

201
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
 OK. Well, our GM protest went very well today.

202
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,919
 What's GM?

203
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,959
 I don't know.

204
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,079
 Great Men?

205
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,080
 A Great Men protest?

206
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 -  Really?
 -  It means genetically modified.

207
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,839
 Listen, Mum.

208
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:11,199
 So, so the farmer came over
 to see what we were doing...

209
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,838
 Oh, GM, GM! Gorgeous Men!

210
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
 Ooh!

211
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,840
 -  Another drink, Mrs R?
 -  Oh, yes, Nick, please.

212
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 You have lovely eyes.

213
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,359
 Anyway, he told us to go away,
 and when we wouldn't...

214
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,358
 There you are, madam.

215
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,359
 -  Where did you learn your beautiful manners?
 -  Oh, I was born with them.

216
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,639
 Sit down.

217
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,439
 And then the police arrested us,

218
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 but I escaped prison so I could be here tonight.

219
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
 It is a joke!

220
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,159
 Come on, Mum, talk to Annie.

221
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,039
 So, Annie, Hector tells me you like animals.

222
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,999
 Oh, I love them, but I don't eat them.

223
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,719
 I'm a vegetarian.

224
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,759
 How odd.

225
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
 If we cannot eat animals,

226
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,440
 why are they made of meat, then?

227
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,559
 You are so funny, Nick.

228
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,278
 But I do love horses.

229
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,279
 Oh, yes, they're wonderful.

230
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
 And I love riding.

231
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,959
 I love your English hunt.

232
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 Yes, the dogs, the handsome men in red coats.

233
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 -  The dead fox.
 -  Yes, the dead fox.

234
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,679
 No! It's cruel.

235
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,879
 The poor fox.

236
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
 What do you know?
 You are not from a good family.

237
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:00,399
 There's nothing wrong with my family.

238
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,559
 You are not family of beauty.

239
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,759
 Well, anyway,
 I don't believe that Hector is your son.

240
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,838
 He's too good- looking!

241
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,039
 Right, that's it.

242
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,079
 I'm going.

243
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 Mum, Annie didn't mean...
 Annie, Mum didn't mean...

244
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 Yes, we did!

245
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 And another thing.
 You won't need hounds on a hunt.

246
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 When the fox sees you coming, he'll run!

247
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 Hector, I shall see you in Argentina
 for your wedding...

248
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,079
 to our perfect princess.

249
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,959
 Well, that went rather well, didn't it!

250
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:00,639
 Oh, who is this?

251
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 He's darling!

252
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 -  Oh, that's Charley. Charley belongs to A...
 -  Me!

253
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,879
 -  He's my baby.
 -  Isn't he gorgeous?

254
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 Look, darling, here's Mummy.

255
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,358
 Women!

256
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,359
 So, Hector,
 who's this Latin American princess?

257
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 Well, my father wants me to marry her,

258
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 but I will not, of course.

259
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
 Well, if you don't want her, I'll have her.

260
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,359
 More wine, Nick!

261
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,799
 Next time in Extra:

262
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,079
 Nick gets ajob as a bouncer.

263
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 If your name's not on the guest list,
 then you cannot come in!

264
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 Annie gets a tattoo,

265
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,799
 and Hector wants to be a tough guy.

266
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,318
 Extra, don't miss it.

267
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,318
 Extra, don'tmissit.
