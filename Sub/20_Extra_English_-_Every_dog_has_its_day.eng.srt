00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,519
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,798
 Annie and Hector want to be together.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,799
 Bridget wants to meet a new man.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 And Nick wants to be rich and famous.

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 Charley, look at that.

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 Hola, Charley.

9
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,999
 What's wrong?

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,278
 Shaving cream!

11
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:34,279
 Whipping cream!

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,358
 Hector.

13
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,318
 Next time you go shopping...

14
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,038
 kitchen, bathroom, OK?

15
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:43,039
 Bathroom, kitchen, got it.

16
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,519
 What are you watching?

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,438
 It's a dog show.

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,039
 I like that!

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,638
 I didn't know you liked dogs.

20
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,559
 I don't like dogs.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 I like those women with their dogs.

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,319
 Charley likes the dogs.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 The lady dogs.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 You can enter the dog show this year
 and win two thousand pounds.

25
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,878
 What?

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
 Hector, slap me.

27
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:23,958
 Thanks.

28
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,878
 How much did she say?

29
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,879
 Two thousand pounds.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 We must enter this dog show with Charley.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,879
 All right, let's do it.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Yes!

33
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,439
 Oh, no!

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,958
 Hello. Earth to Bridget.

35
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,959
 Earth to Bridget.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,158
 Bridget!

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,158
 What are you looking for?

38
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,159
 My new T- shirt.
 I'm meeting my boyfriend...

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 What boyfriend?

40
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,839
 My new boyfriend.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,959
 Tell me everything.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,118
 Well...

43
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:31,119
 his name's Philip, he's very elegant and...

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,799
 Annie, we've had a really...

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,198
 good...idea!

46
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,278
 Wait.

47
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,279
 Careful.

48
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,719
 We've just seen a dog show on TV.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,319
 Yes, that's right.

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
 A really good dog show.

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,439
 Do you like dog shows, Annie?

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,039
 I...

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 hate them!

54
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,519
 They are cruel.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,479
 Not all dog shows, Annie.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,798
 Yes, Nick, all dog shows.

57
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,518
 They are... They are...horrible.

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,358
 You have to respect animals.

59
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,678
 Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,679
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You are so right, Annie.

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,398
 So what shall we do?

62
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,399
 We will have to train Charley ourselves,

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 without Annie knowing.

64
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,398
 Hey.

65
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,438
 Hey.

66
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,158
 Forget that.

67
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,638
 Read this.

68
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,558
 What? 'How to train your dog'.

69
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:03,559
 Now we can train Charley.

70
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,599
 Charley. Here, boy.

71
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,358
 Sit.

72
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,638
 Sit!

73
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,318
 Good dog.

74
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319
 Good trainer.

75
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,838
 Charley's not there.

76
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,679
 Charley's not there?

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,598
 Annie has taken him to the vet.

78
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,599
 -  The vet?
 -  The vet. The animal doctor.

79
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,399
 Well, we can still start training.

80
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,399
 We can? How?

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,838
 Sit!

82
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,278
 I said 'sit'.

83
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,719
 Sit.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,439
 Good boy, good boy.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,358
 Now roll over.

86
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,158
 Roll over.

87
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,918
 Good doggie, Charley.

88
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,359
 Roll over.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,319
 Roll over, Hector.

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,238
 Good boy!

91
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,519
 Good boy, Hector. Good boy.

92
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,078
 Now, now, I...

93
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,678
 -  I want to be the dog.
 -  No, no, I am the dog.

94
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,679
 I want...

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 -  I don't know these people!
 -  Hi, Bridget.

96
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,358
 Well, they're not my friends.

97
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,359
 What are they doing?

98
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,838
 Well, you've heard of yoga?

99
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,879
 Yes.

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Well, this is a new type of yoga -  dog yoga.

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,239
 Yeah, dog yoga.

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,240
 Do- ga.

103
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,438
 Fantastic!

104
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,439
 Come on, Bridget,
 introduce me to these spiritual boys.

105
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,078
 Philip.

106
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,878
 Hector and Nick.

107
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,919
 Hiya.

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
 Are dogs allowed on the sofa?

109
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,638
 Maybe we should eat out.

110
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,639
 Come on, Philip.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,559
 I don't like that man.

112
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
 I don't think he likes you either.

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,318
 Was that Bridget's new boyfriend?

114
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,319
 Yep.

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,078
 That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

116
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,079
 Top dog.

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 -  Tell me everything.
 -  Well...

118
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,479
 -  Let's do it!
 -  Yes!

119
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 Fantastic!

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
 Come on, Charley.

122
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,598
 Wait.

123
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,759
 Where are you taking him?

124
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,998
 For a walk.

125
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,999
 Time to train Charley.

126
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,798
 Let me take him.

127
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,799
 -  You'll take him for his walk?
 -  Yeah.

128
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
 OK.

129
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,159
 Where's the kettle?

130
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
 Bridget.

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,520
 I'll buy Charley a nice ribbon,

132
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 then the lady dogs will love him.

133
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,839
 Hey, Charley. Come on, walkies!

134
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 Hey, Nick. Catch!

135
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,719
 Bridget, that's my Walkman.

136
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,399
 Well, you take my things.

137
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,838
 I don't take your things.

138
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,678
 Yes, you do.

139
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,679
 Where's my necklace, then?

140
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,598
 I haven't got your necklace.

141
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,479
 Well, I think you have. And my photo frame.

142
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,558
 I haven't got your photo frame.

143
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,639
 -  Yes, you have.
 -  No, I haven't!

144
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,478
 -  Yes, you have!
 -  No, I haven't!

145
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,479
 Yes, you have!

146
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:34,038
 Girls, girls, please.

147
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,199
 Don't touch my things.

148
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,959
 Hello, hello.

149
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,919
 I didn't touch your things.

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Sit!

151
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,759
 Annie is so angry.

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,598
 What have you done?

153
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,278
 Me? Nothing.

154
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,519
 She has been fighting with Bridget.

155
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
 The girls have been fighting. I missed it.

156
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,438
 Anyway, how was your walk with Charley?

157
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,038
 Great.

158
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,718
 Women love Charley.

159
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,719
 Nick, what a handsome dog you have.

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 Look, I've brought him a ribbon for the show.

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
 -  And where is he?
 -  Where is who?

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
 Charley, the dog.

163
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,599
 Stay there, good boy.

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,120
 A quick pint.

165
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,679
 'You are too cruel to own a dog.

166
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,558
 'He is safe with me.'

167
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,559
 But he was only tied up
 at that lamppost for...

168
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,919
 ..a bit.

169
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,118
 What's going on?

170
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,119
 It's called...

171
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
 Dog yoga.

172
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
 Very nice.

173
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
 Oh, no. Not dog yoga again.

174
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,998
 Talking of dogs, where is Charley?

175
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,558
 -  He's asleep.
 -  He's ill.

176
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,999
 -  He's having his hair cut.
 -  He's busy.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So he's asleep and ill and busy,

178
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,599
 and having his hair cut?

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 Yeah.

180
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 OK.

181
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,919
 We have to get Charley back!

182
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,639
 Good boy.

183
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 Good boy, good boy.

184
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,839
 Where is Charley?

185
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,239
 -  He's asleep.
 -  He's ill.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
 -  Having his hair cut.
 -  He's busy.

187
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,239
 I didn't touch your things!

188
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
 Where's my necklace, then?

189
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,199
 Nick.

190
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,719
 Hector, hey.

191
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,798
 Don't worry, I've found him.

192
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,799
 -  I've found him!
 -  Great!

193
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,199
 The other phone is ringing.
 See you later. Bye.

194
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
 Yeah!

195
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,398
 Hello?

196
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,918
 Police?

197
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,679
 What?

198
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,438
 You found our dog!

199
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,119
 Great, thanks very much.

200
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
 Bye.

201
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,358
 But...

202
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:33,359
 if the police have found our dog...

203
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 whose dog has Nick found?

204
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,879
 Sorry. I'm sorry.

205
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 Look, I'm sorry. I thought it was mine!

206
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,319
 Up, up, up.

207
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 Good dog. Up... Don't...

208
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,238
 Hello.

209
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,239
 Nick, where are you?

210
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
 The police station?

211
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,359
 You took a dog from an old woman?

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,878
 Nick, how could you?

213
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,318
 OK.

214
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,718
 OK.

215
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,719
 I am coming.

216
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 That woman, she really went for you
 and she was old!

217
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
 I thought she was Mike Tyson's mother.

218
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,879
 We must go, the dog show.

219
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,239
 Hi, guys.

220
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,518
 Hi, Charley.

221
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,519
 Why are you wearing that?

222
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,039
 We were taking photographs.

223
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,559
 -  Were we?
 -  Yes.

224
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 -  Taking photographs?
 -  Yes.

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I'm meeting Philip tonight
 and I can't find my earrings.

226
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,439
 Come on, they must be somewhere.

227
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,158
 You.

228
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,119
 You've stolen them.

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,679
 I told you, I haven't stolen anything.

230
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 -  Yes, you have. You're a thief!
 -  I am not a thief! I'm...

231
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 Whoa, ladies, no fighting here.

232
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,119
 Break it up!

233
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:05,079
 Where's the fridge?

234
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
 -  Hello and welcome to Croft's Dog Show.
 -  Bridget!

235
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 A dog show, how stupid.

236
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,279
 Where is the fridge?

237
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,278
 Where's Charley?

238
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,038
 Charley!

239
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,839
 Charley.

240
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
 Charley and the fridge have gone.

241
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 Charley has taken the fridge!

242
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 Well, it will be a great day here at Croft's,
 this annual event...

243
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,639
 Charley?

244
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 ..with the culmination of months of work
 for dog owners everywhere.

245
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 These dogs are trained to the highest standards
 and are a credit to their owners.

246
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,679
 It looks hopeful.

247
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,118
 Oh, yes.

248
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,119
 It looks very hopeful. Look at her!

249
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,118
 Look after Charley.

250
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,119
 Hey, hello there.

251
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 Look, there's Hector and Charley.

252
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 And there's Nick!

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
 Who's that woman?

254
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
 It's a very big dog.

255
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,238
 That really is a big dog.

256
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,239
 Yes, I know.

257
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 Your attention, please. The dog show winner is...

258
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,759
 Charley, with his trainers Hector and Nick.

259
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,238
 We've won, we've won!

260
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:49,239
 Two thousand pounds!

261
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:10,158
 Congratulations.

262
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,518
 Thanks, Annie.

263
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,238
 But you hate dog shows.

264
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,239
 Well, if Charley wins, then that's different.

265
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,158
 And you won two thousand pounds.

266
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,478
 Well, not exactly.

267
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,479
 We won two thousand pounds
 to spend in Dog's Heaven.

268
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,199
 This is great.

269
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
 Smells nice and...

270
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 gets rid of fleas.

271
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 I'm ready, Philip.

272
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,959
 Bridget.

273
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 You look nice.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We're going out for dinner,
 a very romantic dinner.

275
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,159
 You stupid dog, get off me!

276
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,719
 Charley, stop it!

277
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 -  What is he doing?
 -  Get off him!

278
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,479
 What?

279
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,879
 My scarf!

280
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,959
 My jewellery.

281
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,959
 My photo frame and more!

282
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,960
 Philip, you've been stealing our things.

283
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,999
 You're the thief.

284
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,518
 Well, I...

285
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,519
 I...

286
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:38,639
 Get him, Charley!

287
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,279
 Charley, Charley, Charley.

288
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,839
 He's a thief!

289
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,279
 Your boyfriend is a thief.

290
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 Well, who can blame him?

291
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,358
 He took souvenirs

292
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,039
 to remind him of me.

293
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 So romantic.

294
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:13,719
 Next time in Extra...

295
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,278
 Annie is a hypnotist.

296
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,158
 Nick and Hector are party entertainers.

297
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,159
 But what happens
 when they lose the birthday girl?

298
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:23,278
 But what happens
 when they lose the birthday girl?
