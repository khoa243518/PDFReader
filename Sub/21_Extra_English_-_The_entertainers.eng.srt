1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,278
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,798
 Bridget loves herself.

5
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,799
 And Nick loves babes, motorbikes and pizza

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,319
 but really needs to make some money.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,079
 You are feeling very sleepy.

9
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 You want to be a cat.

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,479
 Now, Charley, say meow.

11
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,119
 No, Charley, let's try again.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
 I give up.
 Here you are, Charley. Good boy.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 I don't need a dog,
 I need someone more stupid.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Perfect. The boys.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,198
 Hello, boys. Come and sit down.

16
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,199
 -  What are you doing?
 -  I am going to hypnotise you.

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,159
 Hypnotise?

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
 Yeah, you know. Hypnotise.

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,039
 You are feeling very sleepy.

20
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,759
 You are a baby.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,918
 Mama, mama.

22
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,718
 You are five years old.

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,719
 He stole my toy!

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,878
 You are 12 years old.

25
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
 Hey, baby, wanna dance?

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,038
 I know!

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,478
 It sounds fun.

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,479
 It's not about fun.
 Hypnotism can help you with your problems.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 I don't have any problems.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,479
 Are you ready?

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 Now, close your eyes and relax.

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,599
 I'm going to take you back.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,638
 Back.

34
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,639
 Back.

35
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,559
 And open your eyes.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,958
 You made it.

37
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,718
 -  Well?
 -  Have you done it?

38
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,878
 Yes, all done.

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,879
 Now, I am going to say a word to you

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,598
 and when you hear that word,

41
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,478
 you are going to react.

42
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,479
 Ready?

43
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,318
 Butterfly.

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,319
 Anything?

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,759
 No.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,760
 I'll try again.

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,158
 Butterfly.

48
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
 Butterfly.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,999
 Butterfly!

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 -  I don't think it's working, Annie.
 -  You're very good.

51
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,279
 No one can control
 the great minds of Hector and Nick.

52
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,159
 So where did I go wrong?

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,960
 'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'

54
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,519
 So if someone says the word 'butterfly'
 in the next two days...

55
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,919
 Oh, Nick!

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
 -  Why did you do that?
 -  It's so obvious!

57
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,838
 Sue is having an affair with Jim's brother.

58
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,318
 Don't tell me.

59
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,319
 Now it's time for
 On The Road with Bridget Evans...

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,399
 Look, it's Bridget.

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
 If I said 'children's party' to you,
 you'd say,,,

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,518
 No, thanks!

63
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,519
 ..jelly, ice cream, pass the parcel,
 pin the tail on the donkey.

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 Hey, pin the tail on the donkey.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,759
 Pin the tail on the donkey?

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 Great game.

67
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,878
 Poor donkey.

68
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,879
 But not for the lucky children
 of the rich and famous.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,718
 At their parties they have elephant rides,,,

70
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
 So they pin the tail on the elephant?

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 Amazing cakes, top- class entertainers.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 Parties like these
 can cost thousands of pounds

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 but listen to the laughter
 of these lovely children.

74
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,238
 They love it!

75
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,719
 -  Give me that.
 -  I want that!

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,678
 Not now, sweetie, I'm on television.

77
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,679
 -  But I want it.
 -  Be a nice child and go away.

78
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,279
 -  Give it to me!
 -  I said get lost!

79
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,438
 Mum, she hit me.

80
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,439
 This is Bridget Evans
 for Channel 9, Knights bridge.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,439
 Get the police, Mummy!

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 Will you keep your child quiet?

83
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,199
 -  That's it!
 -  What?

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,399
 Children's parties.

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,998
 Rich children's parties.

86
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,399
 You can't go, you are too old.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 No, she said top- class entertainers.

88
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,398
 That's us.

89
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,399
 We will be party entertainers to rich children
 for loads of money!

90
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,198
 Don't we need an elephant?

91
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,199
 No, we've got you.

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 You are feeling very sleepy.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,518
 Butterfly!

94
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
 I don't think it's working, Annie.

95
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,519
 'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'

96
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 We'll be party entertainers to rich children
 for loads of money.

97
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,279
 OK, guys, what do you think of this?

98
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,679
 'We are top- class children's entertainers.

99
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,559
 -  'We make them laugh...'
 -  We make them cry.

100
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,959
 It's not like that, Hector.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
 'Book Posh Parties
 for the best party in the world.

102
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,559
 'Only millionaires need apply.'

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
 -  What do you think?
 -  I think you'd be lucky to get one reply.

104
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,959
 Hello.

105
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
 Yes, this is Posh Parties.

106
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,799
 Who is calling, please?

107
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,919
 Mrs George Ducas?

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,279
 Not the wife of Mr George Ducas?

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 -  Who?
 -  George Ducas, the Hollywood director.

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,679
 You know who it is, don't you?

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,959
 Victoria, Lucas's mother.

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

113
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,398
 Hello.

114
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,399
 You'd like to book a party,
 for your stepdaughter?

115
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,998
 She loves fairies?

116
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
 Well, I have just the fairy for you.

117
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,159
 Princess Nicky.

118
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,719
 And here she is.

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
 Hello, Princess Nicky speaking.

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
 Yes, of course I know what little girls like.

121
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,919
 I used to be one myself, you know.

122
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,799
 Certainly, Mrs Ducas.

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 Daisy's birthday on Friday, we'll be there.

124
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,199
 Bye.

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,519
 Oh, no!

126
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,319
 Nick, that's fantastic news.

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,319
 -  It's your first booking!
 -  Yeah!

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 But I will have to go
 to the home of George Ducas

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,438
 dressed as a fairy princess!

130
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,439
 What will Victoria say?

131
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,639
 Who cares?
 This is my chance to get into Hollywood.

132
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,318
 It's the nearest you'll ever get to Hollywood.

133
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,998
 Anyway, what can you do?

134
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,999
 -  What can I do?
 -  What can you do to entertain children?

135
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,199
 I...can juggle.

136
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
 So can I.

137
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,599
 Is that it?

138
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 No, I can...do lots of things.

139
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,039
 Anyway, I will have my assistants,

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,479
 Hector and...

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 I'm working on Friday. She's not.

142
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,599
 -  Bridget.
 -  Oh, no, no.

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 Children and I do not work well together.

144
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,279
 Oh, well, suit yourself.

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
 It's only the home of George Ducas

146
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
 with the children of Hollywood stars.

147
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
 Celebrities?

148
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,679
 All right, but I'm not dressing up.

149
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,439
 -  I feel ridiculous!
 -  You feel ridiculous? What about me?

150
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,399
 There.

151
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 -  This is the last box.
 -  Great!

152
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,959
 Are you ready?

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
 Nick!

154
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,718
 Princess Nicky.

155
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,159
 Hi, Victoria. I mean...

156
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,079
 Hello, Mrs Ducas.

157
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
 So, how's the acting going?

158
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,798
 Great, great.

159
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,799
 This is just a temporary job.

160
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,878
 Is George here?

161
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,879
 He's next door, chatting to a few friends.

162
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,839
 Catherine Zeta- Jones,

163
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
 Orlando Bloom,

164
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,759
 Jude Law.

165
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,760
 That's nice.

166
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,998
 Well, let's bring in the birthday girl.

167
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,999
 Daisy, in you come.

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,038
 Have a good time.

169
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,039
 Anyway, I'm just going next door
 to have drinkies.

170
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 You'd like to book a party?

171
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,159
 -  I feel ridiculous!
 -  You feel ridiculous? What about me?

172
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 Have a good time.

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,158
 Hello, little fairies.

174
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,159
 My name is Princess Nicky.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Hello!

176
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,479
 And this is Princess Hector- ina.

177
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,719
 And this...is Tinkerbell.

178
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 She's really old.

179
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,679
 Now, Princess Hectorina
 is going to show you a magic trick.

180
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 Aren't you, Princess Hectorina?

181
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,959
 Now, we are going to have a magical time
 this afternoon, aren't we?

182
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 Now, would you like to meet Mr Whizzy?

183
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,799
 Of course you would.

184
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,118
 Come on, Daisy.

185
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,119
 Come and meet Mr Whizzy.

186
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 Now, Daisy, is Mr Whizzy in the hat?

187
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,039
 Go on, put your hand in.

188
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 Not too far!

189
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,078
 Well, is he there?

190
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,199
 No!

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,038
 No, he's not.

192
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,039
 Now, give the hat a magic tap.

193
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,038
 Careful!

194
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,039
 You'll give him a headache.

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Who is this?

196
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
 It's Mr Whizzy!

197
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 Say hello to Mr Whizzy.

198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 Mr Whizzy hasn't got any clothes on!

199
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,199
 Thank you, Daisy!

200
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
 Now, Tinkerbell,
 stop that and come over here.

201
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,079
 You've got hairy legs and a hairy chest!

202
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,879
 Now, Daisy, that's not a very nice thing
 to say about Tinkerbell.

203
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 I think she meant you.

204
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,279
 Now...

205
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,439
 I am going to make someone disappear.

206
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,239
 Who shall it be?

207
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,039
 You!

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
 Daisy, do you want to be
 part of the magic trick again?

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
 Hey, Daisy!

210
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,478
 Come on.

211
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,479
 Magic Wigwam!

212
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 Now, Daisy,
 this is Princess Nicky's magical wigwam.

213
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 If you go in there,
 you'll find a wonderful, magical land.

214
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,759
 -  Do you want to go in?
 -  No!

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Of course you do. Now, in you go.

216
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 Come on, poppet.

217
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,319
 Get in.

218
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,239
 There we are. Marvellous!

219
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 Now, we say the magical words - 

220
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,038
 Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky,

221
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,039
 hey, presto, ping!

222
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 Is Daisy still here?

223
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
 She's gone!

224
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 She must be having a wonderful time
 in the magical land.

225
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,399
 But it's time to come home now, Daisy!

226
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
 Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky, ping!

227
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
 And hello, Daisy.

228
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
 -  Where did she go?
 -  I don't know.

229
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,278
 I'll get the cake. She'll come out then.

230
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,279
 Where is she? Where is Daisy?

231
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,999
 What a good game, Princess Nicky!

232
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,479
 Can't you remember where Daisy is? Really!

233
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
 Your mind is like a butterfly's!

234
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,399
 Butterfly!

235
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,399
 The cake!

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 Come out, Daisy, wherever you are.

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 We've got a surprise for you.

238
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,518
 She'll come out when she sees this!

239
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,158
 Happy birthday, Daisy.

240
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,159
 Cue, Bridget!

241
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 What's going on?

242
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,718
 Annie?

243
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,399
 Bridget, I forgot to say,

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
 whatever you do,
 do not mention the word butterfly.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,118
 Why not?

246
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,719
 It's the word I used
 to hypnotise Nick and Hector.

247
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,719
 They might behave strangely.

248
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,719
 Stranger than usual?

249
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,358
 Yes.

250
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,359
 I think it worked.

251
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 So how do you dehypnotise them?

252
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,158
 There's a special word.

253
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,759
 What is it?

254
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 Dragonfly... Bee...

255
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,160
 No, wasp... Ant...

256
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,119
 Dragonfly, bee, wasp, ant...

257
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,039
 Nothing's happening!

258
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,278
 I'll be right there.

259
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,279
 Hurry!

260
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 -  What the...
 -  Hey, Victoria, come and rock!

261
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,878
 Where's Daisy?

262
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,478
 What's going on?

263
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,038
 The thing is,

264
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,358
 we were doing this magic trick and...

265
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,318
 We lost her.

266
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,319
 Nick, how could you?

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 That's it, I'm calling the police.

268
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,478
 Police.

269
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,479
 Daisy, darling!

270
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,398
 Wicked!

271
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,278
 She was in Princess Nicky's van.

272
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,718
 So, have you remembered the word?

273
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:34,719
 Yes. Caterpillar.

274
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,319
 What a mess!

275
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,839
 I'm not paying you.

276
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,839
 Well, then, you won't mind

277
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 that I've put parking tickets
 on four Mercedes,

278
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,119
 five Ferraris and two Porsches,
 illegally parked outside.

279
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:03,479
 Catherine parked outside

280
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,558
 and Jude did too.

281
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,559
 All of George's friends parked...

282
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
 Surely we can come
 to some kind of an arrangement.

283
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,039
 Very well.

284
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,278
 Well, I didn't meet George...

285
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,279
 It was a great party, though,
 and the money was good too.

286
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
 -  You'll need that for your fine.
 -  What fine?

287
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,118
 We had to tow your van away.

288
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,958
 I'm sorry, I didn't know it was yours.

289
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,959
 What?

290
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,999
 Come back!

291
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,278
 Next time in Extra...

292
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,238
 Annie is reading her crystal ball.

293
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,239
 Bridget wants to meet a handsome stranger.

294
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:18,439
 And what is scaring Hector and Nick?

295
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:18,759
 And what is scaring Hector and Nick?
