00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,599
 They have a neighbour, Nick.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,358
 Nick fancies Bridget.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,359
 But Annie fancies Nick.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 That's the way it is
 until Bridget gets a letter from Argentina.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Is he stupid?

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 I told you...

9
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,919
 Sorry. B.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
 Yes, John?

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 Yes, I got the cards
 and the flowers and the chocolates.

12
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,799
 Yes. And I got the cushion as well.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,038
 But it's finished. Sorry.

14
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,959
 But please don't leave me.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,399
 -  Don't cry.
 -  I love you so much.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,238
 Goodbye.

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
 Oh, and happy birthday.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 Ah, men!

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 Come on, Charley. Come on.

20
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 Post, Bridget. Charley and I have the post,
 haven't we, Charley?

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,439
 Give me the post, Charley.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 Give me the post, Charley.

23
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,919
 Drop it, Charley.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Oh, good boy!

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 What's this?

27
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,959
 A parcel for you, Bridget.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 Good. What is it?

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 Oh, it's from Mother.

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,919
 'Bridget darling, this arrived for you
 and I made you this.

31
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,399
 'Love, Mummy.'

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
 Oh, very you, Bridget.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,878
 Mother!

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,879
 Ooh, this is from Argentina.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,558
 Argentina? Who from? What does it say?

36
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,559
 Erm, it says, 'Hello, do you remember me?'

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
 No.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 'Seven years ago we was penpals.

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
 'We was...' We were penpals.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
 Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's Hector.

41
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,078
 Who's Hector?

42
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
 He was my penpal seven years ago.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
 Oh.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,598
 'I speak English good now...'

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,599
 I speak English good.
 I speak English well now...

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,278
 '..and I am coming to England.'

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,279
 Ooh, Latin Americans!

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 'I would like to sleep with you.'

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
 'Do you have a bed for me?'

50
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,039
 Oh, he wants to stay here.

51
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,919
 But, erm, what about the rules?

52
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,919
 Ooh, a Latin American here.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,919
 Ooh, like Ricky Martin!

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 -  Tall, handsome...
 -  Rich.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
 So, erm, when is he coming?

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 Oh, erm, let me see. It says...November 5th.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 Oh, November 5th. But that's...

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 Today!

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,798
 Oh, it's you, Nick.

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,558
 Hi, babes!

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,559
 -  Hello, Nick. How are you?
 -  Great.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,758
 Nice muscles.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,759
 -  Here's your milk.
 -  Our milk?

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 You mean our milk
 you borrowed three weeks ago.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,319
 Oh, thanks, Nick.

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 I forget nothing!

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,119
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,319
 -  Uh- huh?
 -  I said, 'Would you like a drink, Nick?'

70
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,359
 Oh! Sorry.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 No, thanks.

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, erm, Bridget's friend is coming.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 -  Oh, yeah?
 -  Uh- huh. From Argentina.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,799
 Wow! From Argentina!

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,039
 -  What's she like?
 -  She is a he.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 -  Huh?
 -  Not a girl, a boy.

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
 Tough guy, eh?

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Why don't I show you how to do it properly?

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
 Nick, I've told you before,
 nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

80
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,359
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 If you touch my bike again, you are out.
 O- U- T, out. Clear?

82
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,239
 What?

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 I said...

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,878
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,358
 You mean, 'I am called Hector.'

87
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,398
 You are called Hector?

88
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,078
 Oh, no, no, no. I am called Annie.

89
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,638
 I am called Annie.

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,639
 No. She means, 'I am called Hector.
 I am from Argentina.'

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
 You are from Argentina?

92
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
 Come in.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Hello.

94
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,079
 -  Hi, babes!
 -  Hello, Nick.

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
 I forget nothing.

96
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
 Nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 My cars.

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,919
 You play with cars?

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Yes. You play...no.

102
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,359
 I play with cars.

103
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,638
 He plays with cars.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,639
 I read. I love the library.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,999
 Fascinating.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We go to the library too, don't we, Bridget?

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
 Yes, it's great.

108
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,759
 Good.

109
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,799
 I live here.

110
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
 You live in a museum, full of old things?

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 Old things? Yes, I have lots of old things.

112
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,439
 I live in a museum.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
 OK, I live in a museum.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Well, thank you, Hector.
 And now we'll show you the flat.

115
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
 This is the bedroom.

116
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,759
 Thank you.

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,119
 Who- hey!

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,479
 Where do you sleep?

119
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 Er, no, you don't understand.
 We only have one bedroom.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
 One? I have 20.

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,518
 20?

122
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
 Yes, he lives in a museum, with 20 bedrooms.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Oh! Very funny, 20 bedrooms.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 Well, you can sleep here.

125
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,799
 Oh, thank you.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 -  Oh, no, no, no, Hector.
 -  Uh?

127
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
 It's a bed.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,638
 A bed? Oh, wow...

129
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,598
 Oh...

130
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,358
 -  Here's a cushion.
 -  Oh, thank you.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,359
 Oh, this of course is the TV.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 But just relax. I must go to the bathroom.

133
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,119
 Psst! Annie! Bathroom!

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 Now!

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,159
 Oh, my goodness. What are we going to do?

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,278
 He plays with toy cars.

137
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
 He is not a sexy Argentinian.

138
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,478
 But he is sweet.

139
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,479
 And he is polite.

140
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,198
 But those clothes!

141
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,199
 He is so old- fashioned.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 He must go.

143
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,239
 Room service.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,199
 Hello. Who are you?

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 -  Oh. You are quick. Good.
 -  Eh?

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 -  My luggage is downstairs.
 -  What?

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,199
 -  Bring it up, please.
 -  What are you doing?

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,879
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

149
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,758
 The butler?

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,759
 I am Nick. I live next door.

151
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,598
 I am Hector.

152
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,599
 Oh, Hector, from Argentina.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Yes, from Argentina.

154
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,079
 Where are the girls?

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,679
 -  The girls?
 -  Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,399
 Oh, they live here.

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Yeah, I know. Where's Bridget?
 Does she know you are here?

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 Bridget, she gave me this.

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 Hello, Nick. Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,638
 Yeah, I know.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,438
 -  Isn't he wonderful?
 -  Wonderful.

162
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,918
 -  Are you hungry?
 -  Uh?

163
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,919
 We'll buy your lunch.
 What would you like to eat?

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 -  Fish and chips?
 -  Oh, fish and ships!

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 Erm, Nick, Hector, make friends?

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 Nick, teach Hector some English.

167
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,638
 Yeah, OK.

168
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 I'll teach Hector some English.

169
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,359
 Oh, you are quick. Good.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

171
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,999
 The butler?

172
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 She gave me this.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 I'll teach Hector some English.

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 OK...this is the oven.

175
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,198
 This is the oven.

176
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

177
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So you say, 'Annie, the dog is in the oven.'

179
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
 Annie, the dog is in the oven.

180
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,718
 Great! Now Bridget.

181
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,719
 -  Oh. Oh, dear.
 -  Huh?

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Well, Bridget likes strong men,
 especially strong legs.

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,318
 I am strong.

184
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,319
 Yeah? Can you cycle 50 kilometres?

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,078
 -  Yes.
 -  No way.

186
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,798
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, go on, then, show me.

187
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,799
 Yes, look.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 Adios, amigo.

189
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
 Ah. Bridget, Annie, lunch.

190
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,678
 Fish and chips.

191
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,679
 Yes, lunch, Hector.

192
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
 Look, Bridget, 50 kilometres.

193
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 What?

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,359
 Hi. Everything OK?

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 Great!

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I am... How do you say? Erm...

198
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,039
 -  Dead.
 -  Hot.

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,999
 Hot. Yeah, I am hot. I need a...

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 -  Shower.
 -  Yeah, I need a shower.

201
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,119
 -  Be my guest.
 -  Oh, thank you.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,519
 Right, that's it. He must go.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,238
 Why? He is so nice.

204
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,759
 He used my bike.

205
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 Yeah, and he said that the dog was in the oven.
 What a horrible joke.

206
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Where is Charley? Charley!

207
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 -  What a bad, bad boy.
 -  He must go.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 -  Can he stay with you, Nick?
 -  Uh- uh. Sorry, ladies.

209
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 -  Oh, please, Nick. You have a spare room.
 -  No way. Not my problem.

210
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,039
 -  He must go now.
 -  But he's in the shower.

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 I don't care.

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
 Hector, please come out,
 we want to talk to you.

213
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 I like fish and chips, I...

214
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,998
 Hector, please come out, we want to talk to you.

215
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,358
 OK, one moment, please.

216
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,198
 I like fish and chips...

217
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,199
 Yes, you want me?

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 -  We think...
 -  We...

219
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 We...we have a problem.

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
 It's like this.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 Go on, then, tell him.

222
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,518
 Yes, Bridget?

223
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,519
 Hector, the thing is...

224
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,199
 Stay there. I'll talk to him.

225
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,239
 Hector, can I have a word, please?

226
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Ricky Martin!

227
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Hector, is this you?

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 Yes, and my parents.

229
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 'The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.'

230
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,639
 Who are these?

231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 My...

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 -  Servants.
 -  Yeah, my servants.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
 -  Your cars?
 -  Yeah, my cars.

234
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Hector, you are rich.

235
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,238
 Why stay here?

236
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 I want friends. Good friends.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 People like you for your money?

238
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
 That's awful.

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Erm... Listen, keep it a secret.

240
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,359
 -  OK.
 -  OK.

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 Perhaps he could stay here.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 Yes. Poor boy.

243
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,439
 Hector, come and stay with me.
 I have two rooms.

244
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 -  Shut up, Nick.
 -  Hector will stay with us, won't you, Hector?

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Hector, come and...sit down.

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hector, please, call me Gigi.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
 Oh, Charley, there you are.

248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

249
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
 The oven?

250
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 Yes. Nick is a good English teacher.

251
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,239
 Yes, a very good English teacher.

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 -  I'd love to see your photos again.
 -  Oh, me too.

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Oh, your sweet toy cars!

254
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,718
 They are not toys.

255
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,719
 Today Hector arrives and it's Bonfire Night.

256
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,118
 Let's party!

257
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,119
 -  What sort of music do you like?
 -  Music?

258
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,399
 Yeah, music. You know, soul, funk, dance.

259
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 Watch me. Like this.

260
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
 Interesting.

261
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,759
 I dance...like this.

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 I'll get it. I'll get it.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,318
 Hello.

264
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,319
 Oh, yeah, that's great.

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 Sure. Come up.

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,398
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  The tarantula!

267
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,399
 -  Quick, hide, Hector.
 -  I'm off. I owe two weeks' rent.

268
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,398
 Next time in Extra...

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,238
 The flatmates go shopping for Hector.

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,238
 Hector goes shopping for the girls.

271
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,239
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

272
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,199
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

1
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,078
 They have a neighbour, Nick,

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,198
 who likes Bridget.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,919
 But Annie likes Nick.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 That is until Hector arrives from Argentina,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
 and Hector is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,639
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 Oh. Argentinian.

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,239
 Maybe...

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,839
 Hector, please,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 call me Gigi.

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 'Oh, Hector, call me Gigi.'

13
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,439
 -  A.
 -  Is Hector still asleep?

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Yep.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
 Hector, wakey- wakey.

16
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,799
 Come on. Rise and shine.

17
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 Sweet.

18
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,758
 Good morning.

19
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,198
 Oh, good morning.

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,838
 No, no, no. Good morning.

21
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,878
 -  Ah- ah- ah.
 -  Oh.

22
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,559
 Good morning.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,438
 Ah- ah- ah.

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,119
 No, Hector.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,078
 -  I have a cold.
 -  And so have I.

26
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,318
 Oh, you have a cold, Bridget.

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
 Yes, I have a cold.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
 Yes. We have a cold.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,919
 So let's begin again.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,678
 Good morning.

31
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,918
 Good morning.

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,159
 Oh, never mind.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 Hector, would you like some...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 new pyjamas?

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 Hector, please excuse me for a moment.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 Pssst. Annie. Bathroom.

37
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,679
 Now.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 -  Good morning.
 -  Good morning.

39
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,839
 Is it fancy dress?

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,878
 Fancy dress?

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,318
 Yes.

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,519
 Oh. Nice.

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,158
 Hey.

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,199
 Nice car, eh?

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,679
 I have this car at home.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 Wow. You have this car at home?

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,079
 Girls must love you.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,038
 Girls?

49
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,039
 -  No.
 -  No?

50
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,719
 Hector, can I tell you something?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,679
 OK.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 The car looks good.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,878
 Yeah?

54
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,879
 So you must look good too.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,798
 -  I look good.
 -  No.

56
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 You don't look good.

57
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,879
 But I can help.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,398
 OK.

59
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
 OK.

60
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,679
 Yes.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 -  Hector's clothes are awful.
 -  They're so old- fashioned.

62
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,519
 I know. I'll take him shopping.

63
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,559
 But, Bridget, you are so busy.
 I'll take him shopping.

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,359
 -  No, it's all right, I'll take him shopping.
 -  It's no problem, I'll take him.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 I said I'll take him shopping!

66
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,959
 You need...

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,638
 You need a...

68
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Well, hi, babe.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,118
 -  Oh, it's you, Nick.
 -  Oh, hi, Nick.

70
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,119
 Hector has asked me what clothes to wear.

71
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,839
 Yeah, right.

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 You need a look

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
 like on a fast bike.

74
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,198
 No, no, no, Hector, don't listen to Nick.

75
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,118
 -  Listen to me.
 -  OK.

76
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,119
 You need a designer look.

77
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,959
 No, no, no, Hector, that's not for you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,398
 You need,

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,399
 you need...a cowboy look.

80
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,919
 -  No, no. A leather jacket.
 -  A bandanna and a vest.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,918
 A denim shirt.

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,158
 -  A motorbike.
 -  Designer.

83
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,478
 Cowboy.

84
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,919
 Stop.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
 OK.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,598
 I will go shopping.

87
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,798
 -  What?
 -  On your own?

88
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,799
 But...you need us.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,678
 How? What will you say?

90
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,238
 Er...

91
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,679
 It's OK. Leave it to me.

92
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 I am the shopkeeper, you are the customer.

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,158
 -  Uh?
 -  This is a shop.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,159
 -  I sell, you buy.
 -  Oh, OK.

95
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,519
 Ding- dong.

96
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,239
 Good morning.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,038
 Good morning.

98
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,079
 Can I help you?

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 Yes. I...

100
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,198
 I would like...

101
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,199
 Oh. I would like...

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
 a jacket, please.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,199
 Trousers.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,158
 I would like a pair of trousers, please.

105
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,159
 Oh, I would like a pair of trousers, please.

106
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,038
 And...

107
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,438
 a shirt.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,998
 No.

109
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,558
 Shoes.

110
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,559
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

111
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,759
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

112
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,719
 And a cat for my head.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I think you mean a hat.

114
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,159
 This is a cat.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,078
 A cat? A cat for my head.

116
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,079
 A cat for my head!

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,119
 Hector. Come shopping with me.

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,519
 -  Or me.
 -  No, me.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 -  He's my pen friend.
 -  All right.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,239
 I will go to the shoe shop.

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,438
 And I will go to the clothes shop.

123
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,038
 No, I'll go to the clothes shop.

124
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,039
 OK. I'll just buy the shirt.

125
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,118
 I'll buy the trousers.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,118
 Good.

127
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,318
 Good.

128
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,319
 Right. Let's go.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
 Oh, no. I completely forgot.

130
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
 We need eggs, lemons and dog food.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
 Oh, it's all right. I'll do it online later.

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 Oh, well done, Hector.

134
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,119
 Bye, Hector. Oh, and don't answer the phone.
 It might be the tarantula.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,918
 OK.

136
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,758
 Bye, Hector. Be good.

137
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,198
 And if you can't be good, be careful.

138
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,199
 -  Huh?
 -  Never mind.

139
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,599
 ..new pyjamas.

140
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,039
 I'll take him shopping.

141
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,199
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 You need a cowboy look.

143
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,279
 You need a look like on a fast bike.

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
 Good morning, sir.

145
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,958
 I would like...

146
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,959
 a cat for my head!

147
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,199
 A cat...

148
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Oh. Room service.

149
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,239
 Hello. I would like an egg for my head.

150
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,359
 Lemons for my head!

151
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,279
 -  Dog food for my head!
 -  Who's that?

152
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,999
 The tarantula!

153
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,559
 I said, 'Who's that?'

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,278
 -  Hello?
 -  Where's Bridget?

155
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,279
 Er... Where is Bridget?

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
 Me.

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,919
 I am Bridget.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,759
 I don't believe you.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Yes, I have a cold.

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,399
 -  Atchoo! Atchoo!
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Oh, thank you. Atchoo!

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,479
 Charley!

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,679
 Is that a dog?

164
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 No, no, it's not a dog, it's a...

165
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,239
 Annie. Yes.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Annie has a cold also.

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,598
 Oh, poor Annie.

168
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,039
 Thank you. Atchoo. Now goodbye.

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 Atchoo! Atchoo!

170
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,278
 Ole.

171
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,039
 I am Hector.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,919
 I speak English.

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.

174
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,119
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

175
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,518
 Oh, hi. Good afternoon, Annie.

176
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,359
 Good afternoon, Hector.

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,078
 I bought this for you.

178
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,478
 What is it?

179
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,159
 Try it on.

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,758
 Try...

181
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,918
 it...

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,278
 on.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,599
 Try...

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
 it...

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,718
 on.

186
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,719
 Oh. Try it on.

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,559
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In the bathroom.

188
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,558
 Good. I'll give this to him.

189
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 -  It's OK, I'll give it to him.
 -  No, it's all right.

190
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
 Hector.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,359
 Hector.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 I've got something for you.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,758
 Oh. OK.

194
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,759
 Come in.

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
 Spoilsport.

196
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Hector?

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,998
 Hector?

198
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,999
 -  Hello?
 -  Here are your clothes.

199
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,638
 You will look so cool.

200
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 -  Cool?
 -  Cool.

201
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,039
 Cool.

202
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,479
 Nice melons.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,079
 Melons? Who are those from?

204
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 I think Hector has been shopping online.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 I'm really thirsty. I need a drink.

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
 -  But we don't need any melons.
 -  Well, he did try.

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,478
 And he bought some eggs.

208
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,318
 Yeah.

209
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,319
 Just a few.

210
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,239
 Nice melons.

211
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 Just a few.

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Thank you.

213
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,398
 Try...

214
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,439
 it...

215
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 on.

216
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 I've got something for you.

217
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,839
 So how did Hector do the shopping?

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 Hector ordered ten melons
 instead of ten lemons.

219
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,679
 Oh, an easy mistake. He did try.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,319
 Yes, he did try.

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,039
 -  What about the eggs?
 -  OK. Eggs.

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,558
 You buy a dozen eggs, yeah?

223
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,599
 Yep. A dozen is ten.

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,559
 A dozen is 12, stupid.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,638
 I know.

226
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
 Well, Hector has put the number 12 here.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,118
 Well, that's OK. That's one box.

228
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,119
 No. He ordered 12 boxes.

229
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,159
 144.

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,118
 Now...dog food.

231
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,039
 I can't wait.

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
 OK. I'm ready.

233
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,479
 -  We're ready.
 -  Enter.

234
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,239
 Do you like it?

235
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,959
 Well?

236
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,679
 Er... I like the shirt.

237
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,239
 -  I like the sarong.
 -  I like the shoes.

238
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,278
 So...

239
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,799
 am I cool?

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,919
 Erm...

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
 No.

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,439
 I'm not cool.

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 Er...no.

244
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,679
 So...I will go shopping.

245
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,959
 Here we go again. Hector.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 You can't go out there on your own.
 You went shopping on the Internet.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,398
 Yes.

248
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Your ordered melons instead of lemons
 and too many eggs.

249
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,519
 -  Have you ever been to a supermarket?
 -  No.

250
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 My...

251
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,078
 Who are these?

252
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,079
 My...

253
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,239
 -  Servants?
 -  Yeah. My servants.

254
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,439
 -  Servants. Now I understand.
 -  Come on, Hector.

255
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 -  I will teach you how to shop, Hector.
 -  Till you drop.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,319
 Bridget and I will be the shopkeepers.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 And you are our customer.

258
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,559
 OK.

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,438
 -  Good afternoon.
 -  Good afternoon.

260
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,439
 Can I help you, sir?

261
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,319
 What would you like to buy?

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Oh. I would like some...

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,478
 Clothes.

264
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,479
 Yes. I would like some clothes, please.

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,919
 What size?

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,079
 What erm, erm...

267
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,518
 size?

268
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,518
 I don't know.

269
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
 I'll have to measure you, then.

270
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,279
 Arms up, please.

271
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,679
 Arms up, please.

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 Arms up, please.

273
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,999
 Chest.

274
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,758
 112 centimetres.

275
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,759
 Chest, 112 centimetres.

276
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:45,199
 And waist.

277
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,599
 82 centimetres.

278
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,678
 Waist.

279
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,518
 82 centimetres.

280
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,358
 And leg.

281
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,679
 -  I'll do that!
 -  No, it's OK.

282
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 I shall do that.

283
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,918
 Eight...

284
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,118
 y- seven centimetres.

285
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,919
 Now, do you like these trousers?

286
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,759
 Do you like this shirt?

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,198
 Yes.

288
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,199
 Good. That's erm...

289
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,999
 £5,000, please.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,678
 OK.

291
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,719
 No, no, no, Hector.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
 £5,000 is...

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,439
 is...

294
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,318
 8,000 dollars.

295
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,999
 Yeah.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's too much. It's too expensive.

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,439
 Not for Hector.

298
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,839
 So...

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I am ready to go shopping.

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,119
 -  Good luck.
 -  Yeah. Good luck.

301
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 You'll need it.

302
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 Where's my lemon drink, Nick?

303
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,759
 Nick, are there any more tissues?

304
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 All right. I'm coming as fast as I can.

305
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
 OK.

306
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,439
 Oh. I feel awful.

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 Me too. Nothing will make me feel better.

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 Can you get that, please, Nick?

309
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,759
 Ah, it's only Hector.

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,198
 Well?

311
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,199
 Is it...cool?

312
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 Wow, man. Well done, you look great.

313
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,559
 I would like a shirt, please.

314
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Excellent. Oh, the clothes are super.

315
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 And a pair of trousers.

316
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,679
 Oh. You are clever, Hector.

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 And a pair of shoes, please.

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I have been shopping!

319
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
 Oh, I'll get it.

320
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,838
 Hello?

321
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,879
 -  It's me.
 -  Oh, hello.

322
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,839
 It's the tarantula.

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,278
 How are you?

324
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,718
 -  Fine, thank you.
 -  Oh, good, good.

325
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,478
 -  How's your cold?
 -  How's my cold?

326
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 -  Well, how do you know I have a cold?
 -  You told me this morning.

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,118
 Me.

328
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,119
 -  I am Bridget.
 -  I don't believe you.

329
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,559
 Yes. I have a cold.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 -  Thank you.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

331
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,798
 Yes. Silly me.

332
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,598
 I told you this morning.

333
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,599
 Why are 400 tins of dog food here for Annie?

334
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,799
 Pardon?

335
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,839
 I don't know.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,398
 -  How strange.
 -  400 tins!

337
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,399
 Yes, that's a lot of tins. I really don't know.

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 -  Can you ask Annie?
 -  Yes, I'll ask Annie.

339
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Goodbye.

340
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,879
 The tarantula said

341
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 why are 400 tins of dog food downstairs?

342
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 400 tins?

343
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,119
 Hector...

344
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,639
 Next time in Extra...

345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
 Annie goes dating on the Internet,

346
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,839
 and so do Nick and Hector.

347
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

348
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
 But do they like their dates?

1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,600
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,639
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,478
 Hector and Annie were in love,

4
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,479
 but now things are not so good.

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,079
 Bridget has given up on love,

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 And Nick -  well, his mum loves him!

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra!

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,438
 Hector.

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,439
 -  Yes?
 -  Please could you pass the salt?

10
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,079
 Yes.

11
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,399
 Hector.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,638
 Yes?

13
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,639
 Please could you pass the pepper?

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 Of course.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,278
 Hector.

16
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,279
 Let me guess.
 Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Actually, I was going to say we should talk.

18
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,639
 So, now you want to talk to me!

19
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,399
 It's only been a week!

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 -  I was hurt!
 -  Well, you hurt me too.

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,959
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!

22
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,119
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,478
 There were other people there, too.

24
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,479
 -  Who?
 -  People who work on the programme.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 You mean other women
 who work on the programme.

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,478
 Yes, and men -  why not, huh?

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,519
 I knew it!

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,079
 So, who is she?

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,758
 -  Who?
 -  The other woman.

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,239
 There is no other woman!

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 Huh!

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 Annie, listen.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,679
 Excuse me.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 Hello. Hi, Debbie.

35
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,119
 How are you? Good.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.

37
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,958
 Bye.

38
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,879
 So, was that her?

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

40
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,079
 That was Debbie from the make- up department,
 confirming my call time for tomorrow.

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 Some excuse!

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,398
 -  Hector.
 -  Yes.

43
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,399
 Please could you pass me your fork?

44
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,639
 Here, I'm going.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 You can have my dinner!

46
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,879
 You should have seen Eunice's face!

47
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,079
 She was furious!

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 When Eunice gets angry,
 she is a very scary lady!

49
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,239
 Hello.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,678
 Yes.

51
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,679
 Excuse me. No, no, to her...

52
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,239
 Bye, Bridget.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 All right, Hector. Bye.

54
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,359
 Hola, Lola!

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 -  Guess what?
 -  Prince William wants to marry you?

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 I know that! No, I've got a promotion!

57
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,278
 That's nice.

58
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,998
 Nice? Nice!

59
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,999
 It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

60
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
 Eunice is no longer my boss!

61
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,078
 Is that Hugh Grant?

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,079
 It's Bridget Evans here.
 Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
 Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?

64
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,239
 Fab! Ciao!

65
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,038
 Eunice is so jealous!

66
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,039
 Now, that is good news.

67
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
 Annie, what are you doing?

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,678
 I'm doing my own editing.

69
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,679
 Why are you cutting up
 photos of you and Hector?

70
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,999
 Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,798
 Really?

72
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,839
 Why?

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Because he is having an affair!

74
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,239
 Really?! Who with?

75
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,599
 Well, I thought it was Eunice,
 but now I think it's Debbie.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.

77
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,279
 Lola? Who's she?

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
 He's women mad!

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,038
 It's fantastic!

81
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,039
 I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

82
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,319
 Hola, Lola!

83
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,918
 I didn't go out with Eunice!

84
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,919
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,319
 So, was that her?

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

87
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,039
 Hi, Nick.

88
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,438
 What are you doing?

89
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,439
 I am not doing, I am being.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,719
 What are you being?

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 -  Can't you guess?
 -  A man on the toilet?

92
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,679
 A Sumo wrestler?

93
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,479
 Can't you see? I am an egg.

94
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,039
 Of course, you are an egg.

95
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,479
 Now, what sort of egg am I?

96
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,079
 Hard- boiled.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,999
 -  Scrambled.
 -  Scrambled?

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 -  Fried.
 -  Nearly!

99
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,759
 Poached!

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
 Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.

101
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,318
 Yeah.

102
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,319
 Well, you're making a mess on your bed!

103
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,959
 It's my new acting class.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Total Being.

106
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,318
 What are you next week? A piece of wood?

107
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,319
 -  A piece of wood?
 -  Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,159
 Anyway, can poached eggs talk?

109
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,118
 Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.

110
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,958
 No, no, I mean,

111
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,959
 when you are
 'being' a poached egg, can you talk?

112
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,958
 Yeah.

113
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,959
 Anyway, I want to stop now,
 my arms are hurting.

114
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,198
 So, what do you want to talk about?

115
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,199
 It is Annie.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,919
 She thinks I am having an affair.

117
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
 -  Who with?
 -  Eunice.

118
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,038
 -  And Debbie.
 -  What?

119
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,399
 Two women, Hector!

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,438
 You cheeky thing!

121
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,439
 But I am not!

122
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,879
 -  So tell Annie then.
 -  I have but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,639
 -  Why not?
 -  I don't know.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 Excuse me.

125
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,639
 Hola, Lola.

126
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,678
 I'll take this outside.

127
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,879
 How are you, Lola?

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 So, it's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?

129
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,599
 Stop, please!

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
 I knew it!

131
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,519
 It had to be a selfish man- driver!

132
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,359
 Please, I have a voucher.

133
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.

134
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,279
 Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 People park on yellow lines and then are
 surprised when they get a parking ticket!

137
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 There was this one guy today - 
 'Please, I have a voucher.'

138
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,438
 No excuse!

139
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,439
 Mind you, he was quite cute.

140
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,958
 Nick.

141
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 Nick, are you OK?

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.

143
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,998
 Well, there's something wrong with Nick.

144
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,999
 -  Well, I could have told you that!
 -  No, he won't speak, he won't move.

145
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
 I know. He is being a poached egg.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 -  A what?
 -  For his new acting class.

147
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,919
 Hi, Nick.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,758
 Let me guess.

149
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,759
 You are being - a potato.

150
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,599
 Do I look like a potato?

151
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,839
 Yes. A couch potato!

152
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,118
 What about a fish?

153
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,119
 Yes, a frozen fish!

154
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,759
 I am not a fish.

155
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
 I...am...'Pain'.

156
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,758
 You are a pain.

157
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,759
 Yes, Nick is a pain!

158
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 No! I am 'Pain'.

159
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
 Hurt, agony.

160
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,039
 So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?

161
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,078
 What a day!

162
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,079
 I had a very important meeting.
 Big decisions to make.

163
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,959
 Like which celebrities,
 new programme ideas?

164
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
 No, like which pen to use at my meeting?

165
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,478
 Blue, black...

166
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,479
 -  Which one did you choose?
 -  Blue.

167
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,519
 Bad choice.

168
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
 You think so? Oh, no!

169
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,959
 Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job,
 she won't talk to anyone!

170
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 -  Not even you?
 -  Not even me! It is great!

171
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
 You don't want her to talk to you?

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
 -  Really?
 -  Really!

173
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
 Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,438
 So do I.

175
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,439
 -  I miss you.
 -  I miss...

176
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 Hola, Lola.

177
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 Right. Two can play that game.

178
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,759
 I am not doing, I am being.

179
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 A man on the toilet?

180
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,280
 Yeah!

181
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.

182
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,879
 It's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be -  Lola?

183
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 Hola, Lola!

184
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?

185
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,599
 I am just doing my job - Zeus!

186
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,079
 -  Hello again.
 -  Hello.

187
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,199
 -  We meet again.
 -  You're happier today.

188
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,639
 Yes, I am now!

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,479
 But I'm sorry...

190
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 I parked here, so you would come back.

191
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,238
 You wanted to see me again?

192
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,239
 You are so beautiful!

193
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,919
 Well, I'm sorry
 but I am going to have to give you...

194
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,358
 -  No...
 -  This!

195
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,159
 My phone number.

196
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Call me.

197
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,439
 Who needs Hector?

198
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,719
 Hi, Bridget.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,518
 What 'oh'?

200
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,438
 I know -  Superman!

201
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,118
 -  What?
 -  I mean, Clark Kent.

202
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,839
 You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.

203
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,519
 No. I'm not.

204
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
 I'm long- sighted.

205
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,479
 You're being long- sighted?

206
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,518
 No.

207
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,598
 I am long- sighted.

208
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,599
 I need to wear glasses for reading.

209
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,799
 They suit you.

210
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 Thank you.
 So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?

211
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,319
 I'm working from home today.

212
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,878
 I've so much to do!

213
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,198
 Bridget, what's the matter?

214
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:48,199
 I can't do it! Eunice hates me!

215
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,399
 Eunice hates everybody!

216
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 -  They all hate me!
 -  No, they don't!

217
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 -  They all look at me!
 -  Bridget, you are their boss.

218
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,319
 I have to use the executive loo!

219
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,799
 What's the matter with that?

220
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 I want to chat to all the girls!

221
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,999
 Bridget...

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 you are one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful women I know.

223
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,518
 Really?

224
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,519
 -  Well, who are the others?
 -  What do you mean?

225
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,119
 You said I was only one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful girls you know.

226
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 Bridget! You can do this job.

227
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Channel 9 needs you.

228
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,239
 -  Thank you, Nick.
 -  Hey, it was nothing.

229
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,519
 You really look handsome in those glasses.

230
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,438
 Hi, Annie.

231
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,518
 Hi, Hector.

232
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,519
 -  You look smart.
 -  Yes, I am going to meet someone.

233
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 Annie, I have something to tell you.

234
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,519
 Sorry.

235
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
 Lola!

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 Vale. Si, si, ya voy.

237
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 Hasta luego.

238
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
 'Annie, I have something to tell you.'

239
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 That he is going on a date with Lola!
 That's what!

240
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

241
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,719
 Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.

242
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 Nick! Stop it!

243
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Is everybody happy, apart from me?

244
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,639
 Hello.

245
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,038
 Zeus! Hi!

246
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,039
 Well, of course I remember you!

247
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,598
 A drink? Tonight?

248
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,599
 Well, I'd love to.

249
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 Stop it! You're tickling me!

250
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.

251
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 -  Hi.
 -  Hi.

252
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,119
 Well, hello, Zeus!

253
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,758
 Annie, where did you find him?

254
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,759
 Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses,
 though, does he?

255
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,959
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?

256
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,079
 Wonderful, Annie.

257
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,319
 Now I must say goodnight.

258
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 Please, first may I use your bathroom?

259
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,839
 -  Certainly.
 -  Thank you.

260
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 Zeus is such a gentle man.

261
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,639
 He certainly is a man.

262
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,439
 Hi.

263
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,479
 Annie, I must talk to you.

264
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 What about? Your date with Lola?

265
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,758
 My date with Lola?

266
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,759
 Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old
 chief executive for ATV.

267
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 -  What's ATV?
 -  Argentinian Television.

268
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,158
 And...

269
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,159
 She wants me to return to Argentina
 to present their number one show.

270
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,679
 But I don't want to go.

271
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
 I want to stay here - with you.

272
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,559
 That's better.

273
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Hector, this is...

274
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 Zeus, my new boyfriend.

275
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,879
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!

277
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,199
 So, Hector, will you take the job?

278
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,839
 What do you think I should do, Annie?

279
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 So we must say goodbye
 to our friends for now.

280
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,759
 Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?

281
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 Will Annie go with him?

282
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

283
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,039
 Extra - will the story continue?!

284
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,159
 Extra - will the story continue?!

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,798
 Hector works for Channel 9.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,399
 Annie is getting jealous.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Bridget has seen it all before.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 And Nick just wants to have fun.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,118
 Hello, Nick. Have you lost a button?

9
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,119
 Hi, Bridget.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
 I'm just...

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,079
 practising.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,198
 Practising what?

13
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,199
 I am going to join the SAS.

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,159
 The Special Air Service?

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 -  Yeah.
 -  You?

16
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,319
 What's so funny?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 Nick, the SAS is for tough guys,

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,959
 real men who are fit.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
 They're highly trained.

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 I was in the Scouts.

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
 You...

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 were in the Scouts?

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,359
 Annie.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 Nick's going to join the SAS.

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 That's wonderful, Nick.
 Don't you need special training?

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 It's OK, he was in the Scouts.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,718
 Hello.

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,719
 Here in the National Camping Exhibition...

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,918
 There's Hector.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 ..it is all tents, tents, tents.

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 In every shape, size and colour.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,558
 And Eunice.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,559
 -  And we will be showing you the best...
 -  And the worst of camping.

34
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,958
 So, stick around.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,879
 Back to studio.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags,
 Hector?

38
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,919
 Calm down, Annie, it's only a television report.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 I know but, well,
 he's been working with Eunice a lot recently.

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,758
 And?

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
 And, well, I'm just worried that he...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,198
 well, that she...

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,998
 You know.

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,999
 Annie, don't be silly.
 You've got nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
 Although...

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 Hector is a good- looking man.

47
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,119
 Yep, and she's a good- looking woman.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
 Incoming, Broad Sword calling Danny Boy,

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Broad Sword calling Danny Boy...

50
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,678
 I was watching that.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,278
 Not any more. Go on, it's late.

52
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
 Back to your own tent.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,159
 What's so funny?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,438
 You.

55
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,278
 A Scout.

56
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,158
 Yeah, so?

57
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,159
 I can just imagine.

58
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,039
 Trying to light fires.

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
 Jessop, you cheat.

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 Helping old ladies across the road.

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
 Tying knots.

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 -  What was that?
 -  I didn't hear anything.

63
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,638
 Hello, Hector.

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
 Good evening, Annie.

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,839
 Don't you mean 'good morning'?

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,678
 Where have you been?

67
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,679
 You know, for a couple of beers.

68
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,878
 Who with?

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,879
 With the lads.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 So when did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 I forgot, Eunice was there too.

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 So what did you talk about?

73
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,759
 Tents.

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,118
 Tents?

75
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,119
 You talked about tents all night?

76
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,039
 Where? In her tent?

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,999
 Or yours?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Annie. Annie...

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 I am going to join the SAS.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
 I was in the Scouts.

81
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

82
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Where have you been?

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 When did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,119
 Yes! I've got it!

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,398
 It was my turn for the toy.

86
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 No, you've got the Incredible Hulk.

87
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,599
 So I get two turns.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 -  Hey, Nick.
 -  Yeah?

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 What do you think of Eunice?

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,118
 Well, she isn't an English rose.

91
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,119
 No, I don't think she is a flower.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
 No, it's a saying.

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
 An English rose -  a sweet, pretty girl.

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,318
 -  Like Annie.
 -  No.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,319
 Eunice is not a sweet, pretty girl.

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 No. Eunice is more...

97
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
 What is that plant that grows all over walls
 in England?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,758
 Honeysuckle.

99
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,759
 Wallflower.

100
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
 -  Ivy?
 -  Yeah, ivy.

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 Eunice is more like English ivy.

102
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,519
 -  What do you mean?
 -  Well, she...

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
 Likes dancing?

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,598
 No, she...

105
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,599
 She's all over you?

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
 Do you like it?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 I see trouble ahead.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 What's so funny?

109
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,118
 Come on.

110
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,119
 Share the joke.

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
 It's Hector.

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Hector came home late last night, is that it?

113
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,959
 He was out with Eunice.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,158
 Don't worry about Eunice.

115
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,159
 She likes flirting, that's all.

116
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,759
 This will cheer you up.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 Look what I found.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,519
 It's pictures of us when we were Brownies.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 -  And you're wearing the Brownie uniform.
 -  It still fits.

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
 Look at all your badges.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 What was the Brownie law?

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 A Brownie Guide thinks of others
 before herself...

123
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 And does a good turn every day.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,958
 Remember the Brownie law, Annie.

125
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,999
 OK.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,918
 OK.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
 Hello, Hector. How are you?

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,879
 Fine.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,999
 Did you have a good night's sleep?

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,599
 What was left of it.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 Dib- dib, dob- dob.

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,519
 What's all this, then?

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 It is the Brownie salute.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,879
 That's not a salute.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 This is a salute.

136
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
 -  What do you think, Hector?
 -  Well, both salutes are nice.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,879
 -  Brownies.
 -  Or Scouts.

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,078
 -  Brownies.
 -  Scouts.

139
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,158
 What are you talking about?

140
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
 What are Brownies? Biscuits?

141
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 When Bridget and I were little girls,
 we were Brownies.

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,119
 We went camping, we sang songs.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,959
 We were given badges for good work.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,878
 Brownies are for girls.

145
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,879
 In the Scouts we survived.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 It was just like being in the SAS, wasn't it, Nick?

147
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,558
 Yeah.

148
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,719
 So what are all those badges for?

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,678
 This one is for first aid.

150
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,679
 And what is second aid or third aid?

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 First aid is for helping people who are hurt.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
 How hurt?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,839
 Like if they can't breathe.

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,078
 Shall I demonstrate, Bridget?

155
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,079
 Go ahead, Annie.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Lie down, please, Hector.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
 Now, this is called the kiss of life.

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,358
 Sounds good.

159
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,359
 It means I breathe into your mouth.

160
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
 And if you still can't breathe, I do this.

161
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
 Well, that is...

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 And I keep doing this until you can breathe.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,638
 Are you breathing yet?

164
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
 Yes, yes, yes, I can breathe.

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
 And that is my good turn for the day.

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,278
 Now, Nick,

167
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
 bites and stings.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,599
 No, thanks.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,439
 Of course, when I was in the Scouts,

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,358
 I went camping.

171
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,918
 So did we.

172
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,919
 Ah, but this was proper camping, survival.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,198
 What? Like the SAS?

174
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
 We had to live off the land.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
 What? No tins of baked beans?

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 No.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,039
 So could you do a survival test?

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,119
 Yeah, no problem.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,319
 Yeah.

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
 Right, then.

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,638
 We will give you a survival test.

182
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,639
 Great.

183
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,878
 What is a survival test?

184
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,358
 You'll see.

185
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 Just be prepared.

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,279
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 -  Certainly am.
 -  OK. Test number one.

188
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
 The jungle is full of horrible things
 that creep and crawl.

189
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,959
 And some that wriggle everywhere.

190
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,638
 Especially...

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 worms!

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,878
 OK.

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,879
 Test number two.

194
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,479
 Food.

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 You have run out of food,

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 so you have to eat whatever you can find.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 Open very wide, please.

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 Ready?

199
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,119
 Beetles!

200
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,398
 OK.

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,158
 Test number three.

202
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,159
 Pain.

203
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,558
 I haven't touched you yet.

204
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 I'm sorry, boys,
 you have failed the survival test.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,798
 But in the jungle

206
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,198
 it is going to be different.

207
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,199
 Yeah, we were just pretending.
 It wasn't real.

208
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
 What? Like real camping?

209
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,719
 -  Why don't we do it?
 -  Do what?

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
 -  Let's go camping.
 -  We haven't got a tent.

211
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 Well, Hector can get us a tent
 from the National Camping Exhibition.

212
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,158
 Well, isn't tomorrow
 the last day of the exhibition?

213
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,318
 Yeah.

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,319
 And you and Eunice will be doing another report.

215
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,158
 Yeah.

216
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
 Well, then, you can buy a tent
 and come home early.

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,878
 You'll miss your drinks after work.

218
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,879
 Shame.

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
 What do you think of Eunice?

220
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,359
 I see trouble ahead.

221
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
 Lie down, please, Hector.

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
 That's not a salute.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is a salute.

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,518
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

225
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
 Certainly am.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Worms.

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 Beetles!

228
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,439
 Let's go camping.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,199
 In the jungle it is going to be different.

230
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,319
 You will wake Annie.

231
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,519
 Hey, I have an idea.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 I must show you to Annie.

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
 You know, I have a better idea.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,158
 Come, come.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
 Come. You too, come, come.

236
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
 Nick.

237
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,159
 Nick, wake up.

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
 No more beetles!

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,358
 -  Hector.
 -  Nick.

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,118
 -  What's going on?
 -  I've got it.

241
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,719
 -  Got what?
 -  The tent.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 That's nice.

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,799
 -  Come on, let's put it up.
 -  What?

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,039
 The tent.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,719
 Hector.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,079
 -  Have you seen the time?
 -  No.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,918
 It's three o'clock in the morning!

248
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
 -  Is it?
 -  Yeah.

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,878
 Really?

250
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,879
 Wait a minute.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,439
 Where have you been?

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,438
 For a couple of beers.

253
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,879
 And a dance.

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 What's that on your collar?

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,438
 Paint.

256
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,439
 Pink paint. That's nice.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,158
 When Annie wakes up,

258
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,638
 she is going to be cross with me.

259
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,118
 If she sees that on your collar, she will be.

260
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,238
 Have you been dancing with Eunice?

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,638
 Yes.

262
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,038
 You are dead.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
 But...when Annie sees that I bought the tent...

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,918
 she is going to forgive me.

265
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
 At three o'clock in the morning?

266
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,199
 Late- night shopping.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
 It is OK, Charley, it is me, Hector.

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,358
 Where shall we put it?

269
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,479
 Here.

270
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,638
 Here.

271
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,598
 In the middle.

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
 Guy ropes.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,318
 What?

274
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,599
 -  Guy Ropes, who is he?
 -  No.

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,078
 Guy ropes.

276
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,079
 Ropes called guy ropes.

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 Somewhere here.

278
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,438
 -  Look.
 -  That's them.

279
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 Tie them to the furniture.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,638
 There. That is it.

281
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
 Right, let's go to bed.

282
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,518
 What? What's this?

283
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,798
 Who put that there?

284
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Hi, Annie. I've bought you a tent.

285
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,118
 What is going on?

286
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,119
 Well, do you like your tent?

287
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,159
 Anyone for camping?

288
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,278
 It's so cold.

289
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,199
 I'll warm you up.

290
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,358
 Did somebody say something?

291
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,959
 I want a hot drink.

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,518
 We can't even make a fire.

293
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,519
 And there's no water left.

294
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,359
 How long have we been here?

295
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 It feels like ages.

296
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,999
 It's so creepy.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Yeah. Very creepy.

298
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,719
 Are you tired, Hector?
 Did you have another late night with Eunice?

299
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,879
 So who's going to go outside
 and get us some water?

300
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,238
 Well, I won't.

301
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,239
 Well, I won't either.

302
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,638
 All right, I'll go,

303
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,639
 but if I'm not back in ten minutes,
 you can have my Action Man collection.

304
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off you go.

305
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,919
 Morning, Nick, dear.

306
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
 Thought you and your friends
 would like a nice cup of tea.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,999
 Thanks, Mum.

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Thanks, Mrs Jessop.

309
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,718
 Next time in Extra...

310
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,518
 Bridget gets a new job.

311
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,519
 Hector receives a phone call from Lola.

312
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,479
 And Annie is looking for trouble.

313
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,438
 It's not Eunice. It's not Debbie.

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

315
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

316
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,399
 Could it be Lola?

1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 and the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector fro Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Annie are in love.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
 Bridget likes to party and party.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 And Nick will do anything
 to earn some money.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,198
 I love this time of year.

8
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 Sleigh bells, mince pies,
 presents under the tree!

9
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,519
 What? Easter?

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 No, silly! Christmas!

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 I'm going to show you what
 a traditional English Christmas is like.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 Starting with...mistletoe.

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,999
 Mistle-toe?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,958
 It's an English tradition.

15
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,959
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
 But I am not under any mistletoe.

17
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,919
 You are now.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,159
 Oh, you poor things!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,398
 You're stuck together again.

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,399
 Don't worry, I can help!

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,798
 There, panic over!

22
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,839
 - Right, I'm off.
 - What?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,918
 Another television party?

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,919
 Not a party, three more parties.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,118
 And that's just tonight.

26
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,119
 But you've been to a Christmas
 party every night for two weeks.

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,159
 I know.
 It's so difficult being so popular.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First, there's a champagne party
 at the Savoy,

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 then at nine o'clock
 I'll get a taxi to the Ritz

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,878
 and get changed on the way...

31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,599
 What? In the taxi?

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,439
 Naturally.

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 And then at 1 1 :30
 I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.

34
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,998
 Annabel - who is she?

35
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,999
 Annabel's - the night club.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 Will you change your clothes
 in the taxi again?

37
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,519
 And there I hope
 I Will meet a young, handsome man.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 An early Christmas present!

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 I hate Christmas!

40
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,079
 Did you have a bad day
 at the grotto, dear?

41
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,759
 - Nick, is that snow?
 - No.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,398
 Well, what,s that on your beard then?

43
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,399
 I was holding this baby...

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 when suddenly...

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
 - Christmas!
 - But children Love Christmas.

46
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,358
 - Is the money good?
 - Yeah.

47
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,399
 Well, stop complaining then!

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Hector and I are going to have
 a lovely Christmas, aren't we?

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 Christmas is all about
 parties and presents!

50
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,079
 So, Bridget, have you got your
 Christmas stocking ready?

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
 She's taking her stockings off
 in the taxi!

52
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,959
 Don't wait up.

53
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,518
 What is a Christmas stocking?

54
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,519
 On Christmas Eve,
 you hang up your Christmas stocking

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes
 and fills it up with presents!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 Who put that sleigh there?

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 My sleigh! I forgot!

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Mind my leq.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 Right, right...
 Whoa! Not too fast!

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,719
 I feel terrible!

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Poor Bridget. Are you in pain?
 - No.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,519
 But what about the parties?
 I can,t go like this!

63
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,599
 I could take you dancing!

64
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,759
 Christmas is cancelled!

65
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,719
 - Is that it?
 - Yeah, crackers are great!

66
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,359
 So, what else
 do you have at Christmas?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Mince pies. How do you make them?

69
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,559
 It's just pastry and mincemeat.

70
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,718
 - Mincemeat?
 - Yeah, it's traditional

71
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,719
 It's sultanas, raisins and spices.
 It's mince...

72
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,079
 - Meat.
 - Yeah.

73
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,159
 Listen to this.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 What do you get
 if you cross a chicken with a clock?

75
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,719
 - I don't know.
 - An alarm cluck!

76
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,319
 An alarm cluck!

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 I don't get it.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 An alarm cluck!

79
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,999
 One a cluck, two a cluck...

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,079
 A clock?

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,398
 Mistle-toe?

82
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,319
 It's an English tradition.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 I was holding this baby...
 when suddenly...

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 It's so difficult being so popular.

86
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,639
 My sleigh! I forgot!

87
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,158
 Mince pies!

88
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,999
 First, the pastry!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And now the minced meat
 from the best butcher!

90
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,439
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

91
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Well, I've finished
 all my Christmas shopping.

92
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,198
 Oh, madam!

93
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,199
 Refreshment? Mince pie?

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,958
 I followed the re-ceep.

96
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,879
 - Pee.
 - Mince pee?

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,478
 No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.

98
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,479
 Re-ci-pe.

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,918
 Something wrong?

101
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
 Delicious...Delicious.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 You know, Hector,
 Christmas is all about sharing.

103
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,279
 Would you like some, Charley?

104
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,439
 It's Saint Nicholas!

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,878
 What happened to your beard?

106
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,879
 One Christmas candle,
 one small child...

107
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,759
 Mince pies, yummy!

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 With best mince from the best butcher.

109
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 Hector. What did you put in the pies?

110
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,199
 Minced meat - from the best butcher.

111
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,598
 This is mincemeat.

112
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,599
 This is minced meat.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,958
 Isn't it the same thing?

114
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,959
 - Not quite.
 - Delicious!

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,278
 I've got an idea!

116
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 Let's make this a special Christmas,
 just for Bridget.

117
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 Night-night.

118
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,999
 Hey, Bridget.

119
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,239
 - Do you want to come carol singing?
 - Who is Carol?

120
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,439
 Carols are Christmas songs.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 You knock on people's doors
 and sing to them for money.

122
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,799
 - Let's do it!
 - For charity!

123
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 For poor little children.

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Some children have no Christmas.

125
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,599
 Just like me.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And your job as Santa Claus
 is so important.

127
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,959
 You help children
 to believe in Christmas!

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.

129
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,958
 My job is important!

130
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
 I help children to believe!

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,039
 Right, let's go!

132
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,638
 And that Will make you happy?

134
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,639
 Here, have a mince pie.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 All right.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Away in a manger...

137
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 Dog in a manger more like! Good night!

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 Silent night...

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
 I wish you were - all night!

140
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
 We Three Kings of Orient are

141
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,518
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

142
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,158
 Get Iost!

143
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,399
 Merrlly on high...

144
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,159
 Get 'em, Gnasher!

145
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 Come all ye faithful

146
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,479
 Joyful and tri...

147
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,879
 Hi, Annie. I like the tree.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Thank you. It's nearly finished.

149
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 Please, use these. My decorations.

150
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,558
 Oh, sweet, Hector.

151
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,559
 - Are they from Argentina?
 - No.

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 Oxford Street.

153
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 - Aren't they great?
 - Great.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Hi, Nick.
 How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Great! Such nice children.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 One of them
 let me play with his binoculars!

157
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,558
 Really?

158
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,159
 And I've just finished
 my Christmas shopping.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 - But the shops are shut now.
 - No.

160
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,359
 The petrol station was open.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,958
 Look I've bought my mum this.

162
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,279
 A map of Watford.

163
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 - But your mum doesn't live in Watford.
 - I know.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,078
 She might go there one day, though.

165
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,838
 I bought shampoo for my sister.

166
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,438
 Car shampoo.

167
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,439
 Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.

168
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 I like the tree...but I Love these!

169
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,998
 I've got some too.

170
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,999
 It was the Iast day of the grotto today,
 so they were throwing these away.

171
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Can you believe it!

172
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,319
 No!

173
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,759
 Perfect.

174
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.

175
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,319
 Why?

176
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties,
 let's have a party here!

177
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,839
 - When?
 - Oh, I don't know.

178
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 In about 15 minutes?

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 Look at the Christmas tree!

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I know. It makes me want to cry too.

181
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
 What's the point of having Christmas
 if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now Christmas just makes me cry!

183
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,118
 Bridget, cheer up.

184
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

185
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,559
 Have you got your stocking?

186
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 Yes.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,519
 And I've got mine!

188
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 What are you hoping for? A motorbike?

189
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,079
 Yes! Why not?

190
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 The only thing
 that Will make this Christmas worse

191
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,799
 is if you invited all my friends round
 for a surprise party to cheer me up.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Surprise!

193
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 And now the minced meat,
 from the best butcher!

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

195
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,639
 We Three Kings of Orient are

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,959
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

197
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 Good night!

198
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,279
 Joyful and tri...

199
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 Surprise!

200
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,359
 Hang on, I,m coming!

201
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 - Merry Christmas!
 - Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.

202
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 I'm sorry,
 we had a little party Iast night.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm here for dinner.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,998
 Isn't it a bit early?

205
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,999
 Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 - Bernard, where's your mother?
 - At church.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Well, I'll just go and get dressed.

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 To Bernard, Love from Annie.

209
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,198
 Sherry. Thanks, Annie.

210
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,638
 Nearly finished this one.

211
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,639
 To Bridget, Love from Annie.

212
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,479
 A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!

213
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label.
 It was meant for Charley.

214
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,479
 Is she sure it was meant for Charley?

215
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 To Bridget, from Hector.

216
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,119
 Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,199
 What To Wear At Christmas Parties.

218
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,999
 I bought it before you...

219
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,239
 I've got a little something for you, Nick.

220
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,519
 Gorilla -
 because you are the original man.

221
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,838
 It smells like a gorilla.

222
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,839
 Well, you should know.

223
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,599
 I wonder what this could be.

224
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,759
 Merry Christmas, sugar plum.

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 One heart, forever.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 This Will stop it!

228
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
 Bridget, nothing Will stop
 my Love for Hector.

229
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,119
 Well...

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I just called to say Merry Christmas!

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Hector.

232
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,879
 Bridget, what has happened to you?

233
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,079
 - I had an accident.
 - Oh, what a pity!

234
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,119
 You've missed some fabulous parties -

235
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,639
 especially at the Beckhams'.

236
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Elton John is a very naughty boy!

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Still, never mind,
 there is always next year.

238
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,438
 OK, must dash.

239
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,318
 Off to a top restaurant for lunch.

240
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,639
 - Eunice?
 - Yes?

241
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?

242
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,679
 I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.

243
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,039
 It's true, there is a Santa!

244
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 And she's a woman! Wait for me!

245
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 I want to tell you
 what I really want for Christmas!

246
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,879
 - Can you smell something?
 - Yeah.

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Is something burning?

248
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
 I forgot - the turkey!

249
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 Water, water! We need water!

250
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,439
 Not on me! On the turkey!

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 Move! Move!

252
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 There. The fire is out.

253
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,879
 Anyone for turkey?!

254
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,998
 Shall we just have pudding?

255
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,999
 No mince pies, thanks.

256
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,958
 I have another surprise for you.

257
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,959
 Another English Christmas tradition.

258
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,479
 Chocolate log. One slice or two?

259
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,799
 Next time in Extra...

260
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,559
 Nick wants to join the SAS,

261
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 Bridget and Annie
 train the boys for action

262
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 and why is Hector home so late?

263
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

264
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,319
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 Nick loves babes and motorbikes

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 and Bridget loves make- up,
 mirrors and chocolate.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,759
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

9
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,239
 It's Marty!

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
 But what Sharon doesn't realise
 is we've got a camera in the bathroom.

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,518
 That's disgusting.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,519
 She must know that we can see her.

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
 I think it is quite clever.

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
 And what are Paul and Mandy doing
 in the living room?

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
 They're kissing. They're kissing.

16
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,558
 They're not kissing. They're whispering.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 What? Do you call this whispering?

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
 Let's think of another name for it.

19
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
 Paul and Mandy said they could live
 without kissing for 24 hours.

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,159
 And look, they've failed.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Paul and Mandy lose points for that.
 We caught them kissing.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,999
 See you after the break.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Can You Live Without...?
 is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.

24
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,279
 Well, I couldn't live
 without kissing Hector for 24 hours.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,758
 Why don't you try?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,759
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 -  I'm not chewing.
 -  Yes, you are. You're always chewing.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 No...

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,079
 I bet you couldn't stop
 chewing gum for 24 hours.

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,678
 Well, yes, I could.

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,679
 And, anyway, you suck your thumb.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 I do not.
 Well, only when I'm stressed.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,079
 -  I've had an idea!
 -  Oh, no!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 We could be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,599
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
 It would be easy.
 Think of the prize money.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,319
 And Marty Ross presents it.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,879
 He would come to my apartment again.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Oh, Marty.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 He's got such good taste.

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
 And this is fantastic. Original.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,078
 What happened to Marty?

43
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
 He said he needed time away from me
 to really appreciate me.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 -  So he dumped you, then.
 -  He did not!

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,479
 Anyway, Bridget,
 are you feeling persuasive?

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,039
 Of course.
 I'm always feeling persuasive.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,759
 Well, it's time to persuade Marty

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,118
 And then Marty can make it happen.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 I'll try.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,839
 Mr Ross to Studio B, please.

52
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
 -  Hello, Marty.
 -  Hello...

53
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,839
 -  Bridget!
 -  Bridget?

54
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,279
 Bridget, Eunice's researcher.
 We had dinner last month.

55
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
 That Bridget. What do you want?

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,238
 I've got something to say.

57
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,239
 Well, I'm not the father.

58
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,039
 -  No! Nothing like that.
 -  Well, what is it, then?

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
 My friends and I want to be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

60
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
 I wish I could help you, but it's not
 my decision, it's the producer's.

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,599
 Now, I must go.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 -  You can't help me? That's a shame.
 -  Yes, it is.

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

64
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,039
 Or this.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,159
 Where did you get them?

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 Don't you remember?
 I'm Eunice's researcher.

67
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,318
 I research.

68
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,319
 I wish I could help you,
 but it's not my decision,

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 it's the newspapers'.

70
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
 All right, all right.
 I'll see what I can do.

71
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,558
 It's time to persuade Marty

72
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,559
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

73
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,559
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

74
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,119
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Or this.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

77
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,079
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

78
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

79
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,279
 It's Marty!

80
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hello, darlings.

81
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 Do you want to spend
 the next 24 hours with me?

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,518
 -  Yeah!
 -  Correct answer!

83
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,519
 Yes, let's see what the people
 who live here...can live without.

84
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,279
 But it looks like
 they live without anything anyway.

85
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
 Well, let's meet the contestants.

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
 You first, pretty lady. What's your name?

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 You already know my name, Marty.

88
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
 We have a pretty joker here.

89
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,559
 Don't get smart, sweetie.

90
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 This is my show, photo or no photo.

91
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,479
 -  Bridget.
 -  Good luck, Bridget.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 -  And who do we have here?
 -  Hello.

93
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,079
 My name is Annie
 and I'm Hector's girlfriend...

94
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,159
 and I love Charley, my dog.

95
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,519
 So, which one could you live without?

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
 Enough said!

97
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 And this is Hector.

98
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 So, Hector,
 Annie loves her dog more than you.

99
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,559
 Mind you, Hector does sound
 like a dog's name, doesn't it?

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 Here, Hector! Here, boy!

101
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,438
 Don't bite!

102
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,439
 And, last of all and least of all...

103
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,959
 it's...

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Hello? Is anybody there?

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 I know, you're a fish.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 Hi. I'm Nick.

107
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,159
 Hi, Nick. And what do you like?

108
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,839
 Bananas!

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,439
 Baboons. You like baboons!

110
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 You are a baboon.
 You're a small baboon.

111
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,358
 No, it's not baboons.

112
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,118
 You like babes!

113
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,119
 Sorry, this is Nick and he likes babes.

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,958
 Well, let's get on with it.

115
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 As usual, each of these contestants
 has picked one thing

116
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 that their flatmates
 cannot live without for 24 hours.

117
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,238
 Bridget...

118
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
 You must live without chocolate...
 mirrors...and make- up.

119
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Annie, you must live without...

120
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 touching Hector, sucking your thumb...

121
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 and, most of all,
 you must live without Charley.

122
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Hector, you must live without...

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
 touching Annie and chewing gum.

124
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,318
 Nick, you must live without...

125
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
 talking about babes
 or talking about motorbikes.

126
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
 And all of you must live without

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 television, magazines and music.

128
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 24 hours of living without starts now.

129
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
 Come on, Charley.
 You're coming with me.

130
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
 Don't forget -  I'll be watching.

131
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,999
 No television!

132
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,958
 No touching.

133
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
 If you touch, we lose points
 and we won't win a big prize.

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 No make- up. What must I look like?

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 And no mirrors!

136
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 Look at that guy.
 He looks like a monkey at the zoo.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 So how will they do? Top points
 could mean a holiday in the Caribbean.

138
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,038
 But if they fail, they lose points

139
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
 and their prize holiday could be this.

140
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,159
 Of course, we might give them one or two
 temptations to make interesting television.

141
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,679
 Join me after the break.

142
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 You must live without touching Hector.

143
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 Nick, you must live
 without talking about babes

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 or talking about motorbikes.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 24 hours of living without starts now.

146
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,718
 I think it's going to rain.

147
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,719
 -  Do you?
 -  I agree.

148
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,798
 Manchester United are doing well.

149
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
 -  Are they?
 -  I agree.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 I think it's going to rain.

151
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
 Weather and football - 
 is that all you can talk about?

152
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 Well, yesterday I met this really cute b...

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Don't say it! Do not talk
 about babes or motorbikes.

154
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,079
 Careful!

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Bridget, no mirrors. You lose ten points.

156
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,439
 But it's not a mirror, it's a kettle.

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
 Don't argue!
 You lose another ten points.

158
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 Well, it's all quiet now.

159
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 What about some temptation?

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Hector, what is in your mouth?

161
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,878
 Nothing.

162
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 -  Are you chewing gum, Hector?
 -  No.

163
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
 No, he's not. He's chewing this.

164
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 Open.

165
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
 That was from the Red Sea.
 It cost a lot of money.

166
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,319
 I could kill for some chocolate.

167
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,599
 This should be fun!

168
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,719
 'Bridget.

169
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 'I love the show, love from...

170
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
 'Orlando Bloom.'

171
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 Orlando Bloom...watching me!

172
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
 I hope you didn't hear me say that.

173
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 What do I look like?
 What do I look like?

174
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,958
 What are you doing, Annie?

175
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm talking to Charley.

176
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,719
 Annie, you must live without Charley.
 You lose ten points.

177
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,199
 What?

178
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,039
 Hector...

179
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 - Don't move!
 -  What is it?

180
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,879
 It's OK, just don't move.

181
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 I'm not going anywhere.

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
 What Hector doesn't know is that
 we've put that spider on his jumper.

183
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,599
 This is wonderful TV

184
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,999
 Think, think!

185
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 One minute.

186
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,599
 That's better.

187
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Now, we'll just
 brush this little fellow off.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 Don't touch it!

189
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
 It's OK.
 I'm sure it's not poisonous.

190
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,038
 How do you know?

191
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,039
 Anyway, if you touch me,
 we will lose points.

192
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 OK.

194
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,919
 Now...stay still.

195
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,159
 Don't move!

196
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 Hang on a minute!

197
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
 Hector, this is a toy.

198
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,999
 I knew that.

199
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,119
 Hector, you were so funny.

200
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 Marty has played a trick on us.

201
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 Yeah, very funny.

202
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,798
 Who's a cross boy?

203
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
 Things are getting really hot now

204
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 and they've still got over 12 hours to go.

205
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,279
 You know, Hector,
 I really think we can do this.

206
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,159
 We can win that holiday.

207
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,758
 Hello, Annie.

208
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,118
 Bridget, what are you doing in there?

209
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,119
 I'm...just reading the electricity meter.

210
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,839
 Come here.

211
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
 Why are you wearing dark glasses?

212
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 I don't want Orlando to see me
 without make- up.

213
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,159
 Bridget! Is that chocolate?

214
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
 No.

215
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
 But they're from Orlando!

216
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 No chocolate, Bridget.
 You lose 100 points.

217
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 Nick has entered the building!

218
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Nick!

219
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 Yes! Annie and Hector touched.
 They lose 200 points.

220
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 -  What?
 -  It was an accident.

221
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,479
 And best of all, Nick,
 you can't live without motorbikes.

222
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 So you lose 500 points.

223
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,199
 No, no, no, no!

224
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 You said no talking about motorbikes,
 actually, big nose!

225
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,278
 Yeah, Marty.

226
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
 So thanks for the present.
 You can keep your holiday.

227
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,119
 What? You can't do that.

228
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Baby, fancy a ride?

229
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
 Yeah!

230
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,678
 Hector, this is for Marty.

231
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,679
 Or should I say...Martina?

232
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 So, Marty, if you want the bike,
 come and get it.

233
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 Sorry, Marty, we can live without you.

234
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
 Goodbye.

235
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,279
 And, Marty, I think your audience
 will love this picture of you.

236
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,438
 Oh, no!

237
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
 Come on, Annie.
 We have lots of catching up to do.

238
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
 Hector, catch me!

239
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,758
 Next time in Extra...

240
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie play under the mistletoe.

241
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie plays under the mistletoe.

1
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,319
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,399
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Annie cares about animals.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,119
 Hector cares about Annie.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,999
 Bridget mostly cares about herself.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,880
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,559
 Bridget Evans?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,438
 Annie Taylor?

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
 So we went to the restaurant
 and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 and I had the peppers
 and Hector had the mushrooms,

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 which was very nice
 because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,999
 so I said to him that it was good for him to try.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,118
 Annie!

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,119
 And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,319
 and it was such a beautiful evening

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,039
 and the birds were singing...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Annie! Will you shut up?

21
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,878
 Sorry.

22
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,879
 You have been talking non- stop
 for 20 minutes.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,759
 I know. It's...

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence
 for the charity Pigs With No Parents.

25
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,719
 Sponsored...silence!

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,279
 So why are you talking?

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk
 a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,118
 Nothing.

30
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,119
 Have you got a spot?
 I'll call an ambulance!

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 No, but I am going to see my beautician later.

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,398
 What for?

33
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,159
 Just for a check- up.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 A check- up? But you go to the dentist
 for a check- up, for your teeth.

35
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,119
 Exactly.
 I'm going to the beautician's to check...

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,999
 Check that you are beautiful?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Of course not.
 I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?

38
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,839
 Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,639
 Nick!

40
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,999
 Nick! What is the matter?

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 You can tell me.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,439
 You have a toothache.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
 Then if you have a toothache,
 you must go to the den...

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 Can't I say the word 'den...'?

45
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 OK, I won't say the D- word.

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 I call him 'plumber'.

47
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,719
 OK, so when did you last see the plumber?

48
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,119
 That's not too bad, five months ago.

49
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,559
 Five years ago?

50
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:27,679
 When you were five years old?

51
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,119
 It is going to be a big job!

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 He'll need a big drill.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,039
 Come on.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 The girls must know a good plumber.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,359
 Come on.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 Do you want a sweetie?

57
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,679
 Do you want a sweetie?

58
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,879
 Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,199
 Hi, sugar plum.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,118
 Hello, snuggly puppykins.

61
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,158
 Nice clothes. New?

62
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,039
 Yeah. Thanks.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 No, he has a toothache
 so he must see the plumber.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 No, no, no, Hector.
 For a toothache, he must see the dentist.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
 I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.

67
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,479
 'Dentist'.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.

69
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,278
 So do you know a good plumber?

70
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,478
 A plumber? What for?

71
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
 Nick has toothache.

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 Well, he doesn't need a plumber.
 He needs a dentist.

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 Yes, Hector, we have
 the number of a very good plumber -  Julian.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,238
 Julian!

75
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,199
 He's so gentle.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,638
 He's so married!

77
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,519
 Hi, Julian.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Listen, we have an emergency here.

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,519
 What are the symptoms?

80
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,199
 Shaking, squealing...

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, just a toothache.

82
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,079
 You can?

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Thank you. Bye.

84
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,798
 Sorted. He'll see Nick now.

85
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,798
 OK, come on, Nick.

86
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,519
 Come on. Come on, Nick.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 Come on...

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 Come on, Nick.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,279
 Julian looked in my mouth once.

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,839
 With a mouth that big,
 I'm surprised he didn't fall in.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,078
 Hello.

93
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,119
 Who's this?

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,358
 Bernard?

95
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,278
 Hello, Bernard.

96
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,999
 Hello, Bernard.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,038
 You've been what?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,078
 Robbed?

99
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,799
 When?

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 When you were in the bath?

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,398
 All your clothes?

102
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,719
 And your keys?

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,038
 Poor Bernard.

104
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
 Listen, you must call the police, OK?

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 OK. Bye.

106
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,799
 Poor Bernard.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 It's ten o'clock!
 My sponsored silence starts now.

108
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
 He'll need a big drill.

109
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,159
 If I talk a lot now,
 then I won't have to talk later.

110
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,039
 Have you got a spot?

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 I'll call an ambulance!

112
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,678
 All your clothes?

113
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,679
 And your keys?

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,319
 Bridget Evans?

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,559
 Annie Taylor?

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
 Why not?

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,719
 You can't speak? I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,759
 You can speak.

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 One word. Three syllables.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 First syllable...

124
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,598
 Sit.

125
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,559
 Seat?

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 Chair?

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,278
 Second syllable.

128
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,719
 A? E?

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 I? I.

130
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,959
 T.

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,839
 Chair- I- T.

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
 Chair- I- T?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're being silent for charity!

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But which charity?

135
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,078
 Cow? Dog? Cat?

136
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,119
 Pig?

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

138
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
 Is this man bothering you, Annie?

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 Because if he is,
 I am going to show him some Argentinian...

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

141
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,838
 ..respect.

142
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,839
 -  And you are?
 -  Hector Romero.

143
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
 I suspect you're not English?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 He is a very good detective.

145
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,718
 And you are?

146
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,678
 Nwiff?

147
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,959
 He's just been to see the plumber.

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
 -  The plumber?
 -  Yes, he had a toothache.

149
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,159
 But you don't go to the plumber
 when you've got a toothache.

150
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,798
 -  You go to the den...
 -  Biscuit?

151
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,799
 Dentist.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery

153
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,078
 of Bernard Reynolds'...

154
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,079
 Somebody has stolen Bernard!

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 There's been a robbery
 of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

156
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
 Who would want Bernard's clothes?

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 So I'm investigating everybody in the building

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 because someone
 has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

159
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 Where were you last night?

160
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,079
 I was with Annie.

161
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 -  Annie...
 -  It's OK.

162
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:50,119
 She can't speak for chair- I- T.

163
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
 Anyway, what about Nwiff?

164
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,799
 I...

165
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Show me, Nick.

166
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
 I went to Leo's Bar.

167
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,639
 I had a beer.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 There was a beautiful girl.

169
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,639
 And a motorbike?

170
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 You were with a young woman on a motorbike?

171
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,879
 Motorbike. Registration?

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 Name of young woman?

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 He wasn't with her.

174
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,079
 The young woman
 was on television on a motorbike!

175
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
 I saw that! Very nice!

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Gee, I'm getting good at this.

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,598
 Bridget Evans?

178
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,599
 Annie Taylor?

179
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Could I have a word with you, please?

181
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
 Chair- I- T?

182
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,599
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

183
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,919
 What about Nwiff?

184
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,598
 Motorbike. Registration?

185
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,599
 Name of young woman?

186
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,878
 There you are!

187
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,679
 Hello, Mr Reynolds.

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,638
 Well, have you caught them?

189
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,679
 -  Who?
 -  The robbers.

190
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,799
 The robbers who stole my clothes.

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 Yes. My investigations are going very well.

192
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,999
 You have a cold, Bernard?

193
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,359
 You need some clothes?

194
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,519
 What a week! First, Mum went away
 to play bingo all weekend.

195
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,679
 Bingo?

196
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,959
 Two fat ladies, 88.

197
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 Clickety- click, 66.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.

199
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,398
 Bingo!

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,399
 Digestives! My favourite.

201
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,678
 You must be Miss Evans.

202
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,679
 And this is Sherlock Holmes!

203
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,519
 Bridget.

204
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 I'd like to ask you a few questions.

205
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!

206
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 What are you staring at?

207
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,759
 Nothing.

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 Is there something wrong with your top lip?

209
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,799
 No.

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Yes, there is. It's bright red.

211
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 It doesn't show, does it?

212
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,878
 No, no, no.

213
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,879
 They told me in the salon no one would notice.

214
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Thank you.

215
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,159
 I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have
 enough money, so a student did them.

216
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,559
 What, a butcher student?

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,358
 There, there. You're still very pretty.

218
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,758
 Am I? Really?

219
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,759
 Really.

220
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,199
 Where were you last night?

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,199
 -  Looking in the mirror.
 -  All night?

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,239
 Yes, all night.

223
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 How can anyone spend all night
 looking at themselves in the mirror?

224
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,039
 Bridget would.

225
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,319
 I think that someone here

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 is not telling the truth

227
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and I think that someone is you.

228
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 But I told you. I was with Annie.

229
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,159
 Annie hasn't said she was with you.

230
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,319
 That's true.

231
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,238
 She can't speak.

232
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 She is doing
 a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.

233
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?

234
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,119
 -  Yes.
 -  Where?

235
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,438
 -  Shopping.
 -  Shopping?

236
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,478
 For what?

237
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,278
 Some new clothes.

238
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,279
 These new clothes?

239
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,278
 Now, let me get this straight.

240
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,279
 You need some new clothes
 and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.

241
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 So what does that tell me?

242
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,079
 Yes, but I...

243
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Why buy new clothes
 when you can steal somebody else's?

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 Yeah!

245
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,239
 Do these look like Bernard's clothes?

246
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 They could be. My colour.

247
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,999
 Oh, no! I spoke!

248
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,599
 You! You made me speak!

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.

250
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 Bernard, it's your mother.

251
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,198
 Hello, Mum. You're back.

252
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:57,199
 How was bingo?

253
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,679
 Mum, someone stole my clothes.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,118
 OK.

255
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,999
 Right, I'm off.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,799
 Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.

257
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,878
 Bernard, what about your clothes?

258
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,719
 It's OK. She's got them.

259
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,999
 -  What?
 -  What? What?

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 She put them in the washing machine
 before she went to bingo.

261
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
 Mum!

262
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,279
 So Bernard's clothes

263
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 were in the washing machine all the time.

264
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
 Well, yes, as I suspected.

265
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.

266
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,439
 No, you won't!

267
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,638
 What?

268
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:01,639
 You owe me £120 for Pigs With No Parents.

269
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,559
 You made me speak!

270
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Well, will dollars do?

271
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,518
 Next time in Extra...

272
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,519
 The girls enter a game show.

273
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.

274
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:25,879
 And guess what Hector finds on his Jumper.

1
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,159
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 Annie works for the environment.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
 And Nick works as little as possible.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
 It's Friday, it's seven o'clock.

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,759
 Yes, it's time for an evening with Marty Ross.

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,879
 And here's Marty!

10
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,239
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

11
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,919
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this afternoon together.

13
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,359
 Marty! Hi.

14
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 I was just writing notes for your show.

15
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,159
 You like what you see?

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 Marty, you're so funny.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,479
 Is Lady Macbeth in?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 -  Who?
 -  The dragon. Eunice.

19
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,359
 No.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,838
 Marty, you're so funny.

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,839
 Has Eunice got me tickets
 for Damian Pollasco's latest exhibition yet?

22
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,798
 Who?

23
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,799
 Damian Pollasco.
 The most important artist this century.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 He's so raw,

25
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,239
 so angry.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
 Of course he is. Silly me. I forgot.

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,359
 Good old Damian.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
 Anyone who is anyone
 will be there tomorrow night.

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,919
 So of course I must be there.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,118
 Yes.

31
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,119
 So tell the dragon if there are no tickets,
 I will not present Saturday's show.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 But you must, Marty. You're the star.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 But if there are tickets,
 then I will take her out to dinner.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,039
 In fact, I'll take anyone out to dinner
 who gets me those tickets.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Anyway, must go. I've got fans to ignore.

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 Well? Carry on.

37
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,879
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

38
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,239
 What a professional.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
 So if I get tickets for Damian Pollasco,

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 I get dinner with Marty Ross!

41
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,598
 Who do I know? Who do I know?

42
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,599
 I know! Dave! He's crazy about me.

43
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,719
 Hi, Dave. It's Bridget.

44
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,639
 I've got a little favour to ask you.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 Is anybody home?

46
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,159
 Annie, is that you?

47
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Is that Ziggy? I think you should let her out.

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 No, it's OK. We're seeing
 what it's like to be a battery chicken.

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,359
 A chicken that runs on batteries?

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,479
 -  No.
 -  No!

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
 A chicken that is kept in a small box
 to lay her eggs. Poor thing.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,438
 But isn't Ziggy a bit...

53
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,439
 No. It makes it more real, doesn't it, Ziggy?

54
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
 Tomorrow there is a big Farm Animal
 Freedom Protest in Trafalgar Square

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,318
 and we will be demonstrating.

56
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
 -  Demonstrating what?
 -  What it's like to be a farm animal.

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,879
 Sounds exciting.

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
 Boggy and Moss are coming from Manchester.

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,599
 Boggy and Moss?

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 Boggy and Moss
 are very, very serious eco- warriors.

61
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,479
 Eco- warriors?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 They fight for the environment.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 And you two will help us prepare.

64
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,559
 Won't you, boys?

65
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,439
 Bye.

66
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 Good old Dave. I knew he'd help me.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 He just can't resist me.

68
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,319
 Now...Marty.

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,079
 Hi.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,080
 Hi, Marty. It's Gigi.

71
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,439
 -  Gigi?
 -  Bridget.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 -  Bridget who?
 -  Bridget. Eunice's researcher.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 -  Have we met?
 -  Well, only about one hundred times.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Listen, I've got two preview tickets
 for Damian Pollasco.

75
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,919
 Oh, that Bridget. How could I forget you?

76
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,199
 How about meeting for drinks
 at your place first?

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
 I'd...love to...

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 but it's just a simple loft- style apartment.

79
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,598
 Well, I'm sure it's very arty.

80
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,599
 I can tell a lot about a woman from her art.

81
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,199
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 And if I like your art, Bridget,
 maybe dinner afterwards?

83
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,559
 Marty! What a surprise! I'd love to.

84
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,039
 See you tomorrow, baby.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
 -  Bye.
 -  Ciao.

86
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
 Dinner with Marty,
 dinner with Marty, dinner with Marty!

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,758
 What shall I wear?

88
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,959
 My flat! Arty?

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,078
 Annie, look at this flat.

90
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,959
 Sorry, Bridget.

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
 Right, I've got 24 hours.

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 -  I think you should let her out.
 -  No, it's OK.

93
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
 Boggy and Moss
 are very, very serious eco- warriors.

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
 And you two will help us prepare.

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 I've got two preview tickets for Damian Pollasco.

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

97
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,559
 And what is going on this time?

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 Hi, Bridget. I'm feeding Hector cornflakes.

99
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 Really? And why?

100
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,759
 He's a turkey.

101
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
 Yes, of course he is.

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,919
 Turkeys are made to eat lots for Christmas.

103
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,199
 Well, we all eat lots at Christmas.

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 No, it's cruel.
 It's to make them fat for humans to eat.

105
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
 Let me guess. He is a baby cow?

106
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,599
 Nearly. He is a veal calf. Poor thing.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We're preparing
 for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,559
 No, you're not.

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 You're preparing this flat
 because Marty Ross is coming for drinks.

110
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,439
 Not Marty Ross?

111
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,119
 Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

113
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
 So this preparation, what is it?

114
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,519
 I want this flat to look
 like the coolest art gallery in London.

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 The Tate Modern.

116
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,839
 -  The Tate Modern?
 -  No furniture.

117
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,079
 I want 21st century. I want art.

118
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,279
 So how are you going to do this?

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 I'm not going to do it.

120
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,199
 You are.

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,838
 I must get my beauty sleep.

122
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
 See you in the morning. Have fun.

123
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,479
 Well, I'm not doing it.

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 Come on, Nick. It won't take long.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
 I'll give Ziggy the keys to your flat.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 OK, let's get on with it.

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
 There! That's better.

128
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,159
 Marty will love it.

129
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
 The things I do for Bridget's love life.

130
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,439
 What about Bridget's love life?

131
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,679
 Right, I'll be back with Marty at six o'clock,

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,319
 so, Annie, I want nibbles...

133
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,838
 -  Nibbles?
 -  Nuts, crisps.

134
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,119
 Hector, you prepare the drinks.

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
 And Nick...

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,919
 try to be more interesting.

137
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 Now, don't let me down.

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
 I want 21st century. I want art.

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
 Yeah...

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 I'll show her interesting.

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm taking the day off work today.

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 No, you're not.
 We've got lots to do before tonight.

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,718
 Bridget's nibbles?

144
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,719
 No! The Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 Boggy and Moss are coming here
 and I want you to look after them, Hector. OK?

146
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,559
 Come on, Ziggy.

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
 Interesting?
 I'll show you interesting, Bridget Evans.

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 Interesting, interesting!

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 No, too Picasso.

150
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,519
 No, too sporty and stupid.

151
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,919
 Yes! This is the one.

152
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 No.

153
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,199
 Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
 Nearly. Not quite.

155
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 Bingo!

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,799
 Poor thing.

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 We're preparing
 for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

158
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,319
 I want 21st century. I want art.

159
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,919
 Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

160
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
 Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

161
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 Oggy? Moth?

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Excuse me, I am... Nuts...

163
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
 Come in, come in.

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
 Please...sit down.

165
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 So, you are Annie's friends?

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
 I am Annie's boyfriend.

167
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 Would you like a drink?

168
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 You would? You wouldn't?

169
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 Tea? Coffee? Sugar?

170
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,318
 It is my phone.

171
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,959
 I know you know it is a phone,

172
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,960
 but it is ringing, so I must...

173
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 Excuse me.

174
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,038
 Annie, I'm so happy you rang.

175
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
 Hector, I'm in the ladies' toilets
 in Trafalgar Square.

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,398
 Have Boggy and Moss arrived yet?

177
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,759
 Yes.

178
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 Annie, they are a bit...

179
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,959
 Aren't they sweet?

180
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,959
 Yes, very sweet.

181
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 It is just that they...

182
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,639
 All right, chaps? Won't be a minute.

183
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 It is just that they are a bit scary.

184
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,879
 Hector, don't be so silly.

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 Tell them to come to Trafalgar Square now.

186
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Great.

187
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 You found something to eat. Good.

188
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,359
 You like them?

189
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Good, good, good.

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
 Annie says you can go to Trafalgar Square. Now.

191
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 It is the phone again.

192
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 Phones ring, don't they? They...

193
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,279
 Excuse me.

194
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,719
 Hello.

195
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 Hello, Hector. Did you get the nibbles?

196
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,039
 The nibbles. The nibbles.

197
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,038
 Yes, of course, Bridget.

198
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 Well done, Hector. I knew I could rely on you.

199
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
 That was Bridget, Annie's fr...

200
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,599
 Now am I interesting?

201
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
 Do I look that bad?

202
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
 This is interesting!

203
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 What shall I do? It was Boggy and Moss.

204
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
 Look, don't worry. We can tidy this up.

205
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,199
 Look. See? Look.

206
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
 Yeah, that looks much better.

207
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 -  Still, at least I've brought the drinks.
 -  And I have the nibbles.

208
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
 -  What?
 -  The nibbles.

209
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,278
 Very good.

210
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,279
 Oh, no! Boggy and Moss ate them.

211
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 Look at this!

212
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,999
 Tastes good.

213
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 See? Bridget won't even notice the mess.

214
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,359
 Marty, you're so funny.

215
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,119
 Anyway, here is my humble home.

216
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
 Mr Ross, I'm a huge fan.

217
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 What is that?

218
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 It's a pigpen. We stole it from a farm lorry.

219
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,038
 What a shame, no pig.

220
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,039
 Boggy and Moss are bringing her later.

221
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
 -  This place...
 -  This place is very...

222
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,798
 I'm so angry!

223
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,799
 ..angry. I love it!

224
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 Yes. Yes, it's my angry art phase.

225
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,758
 All my own ideas, you know.

226
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,759
 -  Cocktail?
 -  Nibble?

227
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And this is fantastic. Original?

228
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,998
 Very original.

229
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,999
 Very Damian Pollasco. I love art.

230
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

231
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 Is it...for sale?

232
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
 The man's an idiot. He wants to buy a wall.

233
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,198
 Much too expensive.

234
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,199
 Much too precious.

235
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
 Name your price.

236
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,519
 Can you deliver them to me tomorrow?

237
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 Sure. No problem.

238
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,038
 Nick, what's this cocktail called?

239
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,519
 It's an Arty Marty.

240
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 It's rich, sickly and very thick.

241
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,239
 Nick, your date is here.

242
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,319
 Of course she is.

243
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
 Next time in Extra...

244
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,599
 Nick goes to the dentist.

245
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,638
 Annie can't speak.

246
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,639
 And why does an inspector call?

247
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,038
 And why does an inspector call?
