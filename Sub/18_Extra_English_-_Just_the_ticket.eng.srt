1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,440
 Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,559
 and Annie wants a job too,

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 but Nick just wants
 babes, babes and babes.

6
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,199
 'Dear Miss Taylor,
 thank you for your recent CV,

8
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,679
 'but at present we haven't got anything
 to suit your talents.'

9
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,879
 'Dear Miss Taylor...
 Blah- blah- blah- blah.'

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 How surprising.

11
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,519
 What is the point of all that studying
 if I cannot get a job?

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,278
 Right, last one.

13
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:39,279
 Paws crossed, Charley.

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 'Dear Miss Taylor...'

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 What is the point of having a car
 if you cannot park?

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,238
 'Thank you for your recent letter...'

17
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,239
 She's got four eyes and reptile skin.

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,479
 'We are very pleased to tell you...'

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 -  She sees your car...
 -  '..that you have been successful...'

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,160
 She slides over to it.

21
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,679
 She's got you!

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,199
 '..in your application as a...'

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
 Yes, she is the...

24
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,558
 Traffic warden!

25
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,398
 -  Correct.
 -  What?

26
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,719
 I've just got a ticket.

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 I've just got a job.

28
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,638
 As a traffic warden?

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,639
 -  Annie, you'll be one of them.
 -  One of who?

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,760
 Annie is going to be a traffic warden.

31
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 Well, I have to pass
 the entrance exam first.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 -  What is a traffic warden?
 -  Someone who spoils your day.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 A traffic warden is someone
 who stops stupid people

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,599
 parking their stupid cars
 in stupid places.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
 See? It's started.

36
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,479
 I didn't know
 you wanted to be a traffic warden.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 I didn't know either,
 but no one else would have me.

38
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,399
 But it is good for the environment
 to reduce the cars on our roads.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 -  So you will have another exam?
 -  Yeah.

40
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,399
 Another exam.

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,398
 Well, don't worry. I can help.

42
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,399
 I've got experience of traffic wardens.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
 OK, Hector, you can be the driver...

44
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,078
 and I will be the traffic warden.

45
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,038
 -  OK.
 -  You can't park there.

46
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,798
 -  Yes, I can.
 -  No, you can't.

47
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,958
 -  Yes, I can.
 -  No.

48
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,959
 Yes, I can, because this is a bus stop
 and I am driving a bus.

49
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,879
 The excuses I hear.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 Sorry, sorry.
 Emergency appointment.

51
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,559
 -  Bad leg.
 -  Which leg?

52
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,919
 No, no, no, it's not me. It's my hamster.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Sweet.

54
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 Sorry, Eric! Eric?

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
 Surely we can come to some arrangement?

56
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,438
 Of course we can, sir.

57
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,439
 You can pay for the ticket,
 I can go home for my tea.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
 and there wasn't a place to park.

59
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,398
 But surely we can sort this out?

60
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,399
 When a beautiful woman
 meets a handsome man...

61
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,679
 Well, you're in my little black book now,
 darling.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,558
 I've only been two minutes!

63
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,559
 Well, I have started...so I'll finish.

64
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,799
 Sorry, I got stuck up a chimney.

65
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
 Yes, and there are fairies
 at the bottom of my garden, sir.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,478
 Rudolph!

67
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,479
 Rudolph!

68
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 See? Now you know what to expect.

69
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 I can't wait.

70
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,479
 'Late ironing -  penalty £20.'

71
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:59,559
 'Late washing- up -  penalty £5.'

72
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
 Annie.

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 I need a drink.

74
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,239
 I don't believe it.
 She's clamped the fridge.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,959
 Did you have a good day, Bridget?

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 -  Yes, I did.
 -  Why is the TV moved?

77
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,839
 Annie towed it away this morning.
 No licence.

78
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,679
 Really, Hector, you must talk to her.

79
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,680
 She's too serious
 about this traffic warden exam.

80
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,199
 I do try, but if I stop to talk to her,

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,639
 she gives me a parking ticket.

82
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,398
 Anyway, exciting news.

83
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,399
 Channel Nine is presenting
 the Miss Euro babe Beauty Contest.

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,438
 And guess who Eunice wants
 to present the show.

85
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,318
 -  Me!
 -  You, Hector!

86
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,319
 I could enter the contest myself,
 but I might...

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
 -  Frighten the judges?
 -  Win.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,318
 The programme will need my expertise.

89
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
 And mine!

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
 -  So will you present the show, Hector?
 -  When is it?

91
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 -  Next Friday.
 -  That's the day of Annie's exam.

92
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,399
 A double contest, then.

93
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,839
 But you'll be OK. I'll help you.

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,238
 Think of those babes!

95
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,239
 It's my job to give you
 all the information about the girls,

96
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,279
 so nothing can go wrong.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
 -  Well, OK, then.
 -  Good. Great.

98
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,159
 So, when do we start?

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,519
 We?

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,478
 Well, Hector will need an interpreter

101
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,479
 to help him talk to all those babes.

102
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 Nick, you're not getting involved
 in this show.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 What is the point of having a car
 if you cannot park?

104
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,439
 -  What is a traffic warden?
 -  Someone who spoils your day.

105
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:27,359
 Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
 and there wasn't a place to park.

106
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,118
 And guess who Eunice wants
 to present the show.

107
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,119
 -  Me!
 -  You, Hector!

108
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,879
 -  Well, OK, then.
 -  Good. Great.

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 You have a very difficult job.

110
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,759
 You are right.

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 But a very important job.

112
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,318
 Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,239
 No, I mean it.

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 I know, but I've still
 got to give you a ticket.

115
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,959
 That's OK. It's your job.

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 There you are, sir. Have a nice day.

117
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,159
 Thank you. And you.

118
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,599
 How nice to meet a reasonable customer.

119
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,839
 Why are you dressed to go to war, Annie?

120
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 I'm going for my traffic warden exam.

121
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,399
 Are you expecting trouble?

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 There are a lot of difficult motorists
 out there.

123
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
 What have you got there?

124
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 It's the information
 for the Euro babe contestants.

125
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,759
 Hector must learn
 what each girl likes and dislikes.

126
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,359
 -  Anything interesting?
 -  Let's see.

127
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,159
 She likes children and animals.

128
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,079
 She likes children and animals.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 She likes children and animals.

130
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 This one's different. Miss Holland Babe.

131
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,959
 She likes reading and her ambition...

132
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
 is to learn to read.

133
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,919
 Here's another one. Miss Belgium Babe.

134
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,999
 Her ambition is to go to the moon.

135
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,679
 But she doesn't like flying.

136
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,240
 Well, it should be an exciting show.

137
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 I hope so.
 Well, at least Hector is ready for it.

138
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,839
 And so...

139
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,718
 am I.

140
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,719
 I said no.

141
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,558
 Cue Hector.

142
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,559
 Good evening
 and a very warm well...come

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 to Channel Nine's Eurobaby Contest live.

144
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,718
 Yes, OK. Get on with it.

145
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,719
 Have we got some lovely ladies
 for you tonight. Have we?

146
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,319
 Yes, of course we have.

147
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,399
 Yes, yes, we have. Of course we have.

148
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,359
 So let's meet our lovely contestants

149
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,799
 eager to wear
 the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

150
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,639
 Nick, get off now.

151
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,639
 Nick! Get off now!

152
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
 If you don't get off
 by the time I count to three,

153
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,918
 I will cut off your ears.

154
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,919
 One...two...

155
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,638
 Comedy!

156
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,678
 Cue Miss Swedenbabe.

157
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,679
 So let's meet our first contestant.

158
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 Miss Swedenbaby!

159
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 This is why I didn't want you here.

160
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,918
 What's that?

161
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,919
 Miss Englandbabe is where?

162
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
 She's been clamped?

163
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:29,119
 Well, tell her to get a taxi, then.

164
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 She won't leave her Porsche?

165
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,799
 I'll come and get her.

166
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 Who's going to do this?

167
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,639
 Listen to me.

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
 You have one simple job.

169
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,359
 You must tell Hector who each girl is.

170
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
 Their names are on these cards. Got it?

171
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,759
 Do not mess it up.

172
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,839
 Who? Me?

173
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,159
 Thank you, Miss Swedenbaby!

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Miss Finlandbabe!

175
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,799
 Miss Finlandbaby!

176
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,759
 Well, good luck with the elephants.

177
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,359
 Thank you, Miss Finlandbaby.

178
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,199
 Miss Spainbabe!

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 Miss Spainbaby!

180
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 You are not Miss Spainbaby.

181
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,639
 So, Miss Italybaby,

182
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,920
 it says here that your hobbies
 are children and animals.

183
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,799
 Fascinating.

184
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,559
 Yes! It's your favourite traffic warden.

185
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 It's...me!

186
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:19,479
 I passed!

187
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 Where is everybody?

188
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,039
 The Eurobabe Contest.

189
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,759
 Well, good luck with the dolphins.

190
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Thank you, Miss Italybaby.

191
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 Miss Hungarybaby!

192
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 Are you Hungary? Are you Hungary?

193
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,519
 You are not Miss Hungarybaby.

194
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 So welcome, Miss...oh, no.

195
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
 -  How's it going?
 -  Very well. No problems.

196
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,399
 She's a bit emotional, I think.

197
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,919
 We've got big problems.

198
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,839
 Miss Englandbabe will not come here.

199
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,478
 -  She's broken a nail.
 -  Nasty.

200
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,479
 But we've got to have
 a Miss Englandbabe. We are in London.

201
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,920
 Yes, Eunice? Right away, Eunice.

202
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,438
 Eunice wants to see me. Now.

203
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,439
 Think of something, Nick, and fast.

204
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,559
 ..eager to wear
 the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

205
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
 Miss Englandbabe is where?

206
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,479
 Miss Spainbabe!

207
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
 Think of something, Nick, and fast.

208
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,559
 She's a bit emotional, I think.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 -  She's broken a nail.
 -  Nasty.

210
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 And we come to our last contestant

211
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 in this fantastic Eurobaby Contest.

212
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,919
 Last but not least, it is...

213
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,439
 It is...

214
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,479
 Of course!

215
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,480
 It is Miss Englandbaby!

216
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,559
 Welcome, Miss England...

217
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,119
 -  Welcome.
 -  Thank you. Thank you.

218
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:21,439
 Well, let's find out about you.

219
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,478
 You like pizzas...

220
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,479
 rock 'n' roll and motorbikes.

221
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 My kind of girl!

222
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 And dancing with women.

223
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 I think you mean men. Dancing with...

224
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,239
 Nick!

225
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,039
 What do you think you're doing?

226
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,040
 You said you needed
 a Miss Englandbaby fast.

227
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,439
 I meant a woman.

228
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,438
 -  Nice legs, Nick.
 -  Thanks, Annie.

229
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,439
 -  Hi, Annie.
 -  Thank you, Miss Englandbaby.

230
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
 And next, we find out why our babies

231
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,159
 want to represent their country.

232
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,558
 There are beautiful women everywhere.

233
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,319
 I know!

234
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,919
 Miss Englandbabe is still missing.

235
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,958
 What are we going to do?

236
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,959
 Eunice said she'll fire me
 if I don't find someone.

237
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:32,199
 Oh, no! No.

238
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,759
 Bingo!

239
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,559
 I hear we have a replacement
 for our last contestant.

240
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 It is the new Miss Englandbaby!

241
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 So tell me, Miss Englandbaby...

242
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:05,879
 why do you want
 to represent your country?

243
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,558
 I want to represent England

244
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,559
 because I care
 about the environment, pollution.

245
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 I care about people.

246
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,119
 And I have great legs.

247
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,999
 And the winner of the Channel Nine
 Eurobaby Contest is...

248
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,039
 Miss Englandbaby!

249
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
 Congratulations, Annie! You did it!

250
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,239
 You are the most beautiful
 traffic warden in Europe!

251
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 Next time in Extra...

252
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,198
 Nick gets a job in a kung fu movie.

253
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:17,199
 Bridget nearly loses her job.

254
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:20,719
 And what happens
 when Annie meets a new man?

255
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:21,919
 And what happens
 when Annie meets a newman?
