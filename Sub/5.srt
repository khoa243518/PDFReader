1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,640
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,759
 The girls like Hector because he is...pure.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 And Nick likes Hector because he is rich.

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,439
 And Hector likes Nick
 because he is one crazy guy.

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,759
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,758
 But I can't live without you.

8
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,719
 I love you.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
 I love you too, but it's for the best.
 It's finished.

10
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:25,279
 Oh! Oh, darling, no. I'll die without you.

11
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,879
 Ohh. She can't!

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
 No, she can't. He's too good- looking.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
 And her husband is so awful.

14
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,679
 I'm sorry. I'm more sorry than you are.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
 It's your turn.

16
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,879
 Hello.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 A message for who? Rock Thrust?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Erm, I'm sorry,
 but I think you have the wrong number.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 That's OK. Bye.

20
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,638
 Well, who was that?

21
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,639
 Someone wanted Rock Thrust.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 Rock Thrust? What a stupid name.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,559
 I know. Who would have a silly name like that?

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 Go, go, go, go, go!

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,478
 Go!

26
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,759
 It's a raid!

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
 Don't move. Legs in the air.

28
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,399
 Hands. Not legs. Hands in the air.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,679
 OK.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
 Hands in the air.

31
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,759
 Hello, Nick. Hello, Hector.

32
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,479
 -  How did you know it was us?
 -  Huh?

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
 Oh, lucky guess.

34
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,959
 Great. It's like Piccadilly Circus here
 on a Friday night.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,359
 Uh?

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 This apartment is very busy.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 Crazy phone calls, crazy names and now the FBI!

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 So, Bridget darling, any messages for me?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 What do you mean, messages?

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,878
 Who do you think I am? Your secretary?

41
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,879
 This is not your apartment. You do not live here.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,799
 I never have any privacy.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,039
 But they cut off my telephone.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 That's not my problem.
 You should pay your bills.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,718
 Sorry, Bridget.

46
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,719
 And, Hector, you live with Nick now.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 Please knock on the door.

48
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,279
 Now, I want to be alone.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 Well, that went well. What's wrong with her?

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,119
 -  Nick, what day is it?
 -  Erm, Wednesday.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 -  And what time is it?
 -  I know. Half past six.

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 -  So...
 -  So...

53
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,919
 So what's on television?

54
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,999
 Oh, Love's True Dream.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 Love's True Dream. What is that?

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 Oh, Alberto, Alberto!

57
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,599
 I love you, I love you!

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 And I love you too, Penelope.

59
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,919
 -  Bridget's favourite programme.
 -  Yeah, and mine.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 Oh, really, Annie? Why?

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,399
 Because it's about the simple love

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
 of a boy from Argentina and a girl from England.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,399
 Uh?

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
 The simple love of a boy from Argentina
 and a girl from England.

65
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,599
 Oh.

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 Nice.

67
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 Oh, Hector! I love this advert.

68
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,758
 What is it?

69
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,759
 It's for chocolate mousse. Shh.

70
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,999
 Chocolate so smooth
 it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.

71
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,399
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 Mmm, I love chocolate mousse.

73
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,199
 Hey! This advert's good too.

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,919
 # Ooh! Popcorn in the microwave

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,598
 # Popcorn in just seconds

76
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,879
 # Popcorn in your tummy

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,199
 # They're Poptastic #

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 Ha! And do you like popcorn, Annie?

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 Oh, yeah, especially Poptastic popcorn.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,799
 Well, we don't have
 Poptastic popcorn in Argentina,

81
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,159
 but we make great popcorn.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 -  Yeah?
 -  Yes. I'll make it in the frying pan.

83
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,919
 Oh, yes! Yes, great!

84
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,159
 I've got the part! I've got the part!

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 Wow, man! That is great! Hey!

86
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,798
 What is it?

87
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,799
 Let's just say
 that my face will be on your television

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 every night at six o'clock
 in front of a huge audience.

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
 Oh- ho! Ladies and gentleman, a star is born!

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,318
 Oh, Nick, that's fantastic!

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,798
 Ha- ha! This is it, Nick.

92
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,799
 Today, London, tomorrow, Hollywood.

93
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 I'd just like to thank my parents,
 my brothers, my sisters...

94
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,079
 my dog, his vet...

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
 and of course my adorable girlfriend Bridget.

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Huh! I don't think so.

97
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,158
 Anyway, what's going on?

98
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,558
 Oh, it's wonderful news, Bridget.

99
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Nick is going to be on television.

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,759
 Well, tell us, Nick. What is it?

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
 Well, it's on every night.

102
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,758
 It'll be hot.

103
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,759
 Sometimes it'll be stormy.

104
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 So will you still love me when I'm a superstar?

105
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,919
 Yes, Nick, and I'm going to help you
 to be a great superstar.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,398
 Yes!

107
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,398
 Lesson number one.

108
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 This is how all superstars make a big exit.

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 Goodbye, Nick. See you at the Oscars.

110
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,238
 -  Annie?
 -  Uh- huh?

111
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,239
 I really think you're watching too many adverts.

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,239
 What do you mean, too many adverts?

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Well, remember Chunky Chunks?

114
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,119
 Oh, Chunky Chunks...

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 Hello and welcome
 to the Chunky Chunks challenge.

116
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,959
 Nick, in front of you are two plates

117
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,679
 and all you have to do is tell me
 which plate is Chunky Chunks - 

118
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,159
 A or B.

119
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,638
 Ready? OK.

120
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,639
 This is Plate A.

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
 Good. And this is Plate B.

122
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,359
 OK, Nick.

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
 Which plate do you think was Chunky Chunks?
 A or B?

124
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 Well, they both smelled great.

125
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,918
 Correct! Well done!

126
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,919
 Both plates were Chunky Chunks.

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,639
 -  By the way, Annie...
 -  Uh- huh?

128
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,639
 What are Chunky Chunks?

129
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
 Dog food, of course.

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
 -  Do you see what I mean?
 -  Oh, I think so.

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,078
 What's that noise?

132
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,079
 Oh, Annie's popcorn!

133
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,879
 -  My popcorn?
 -  Yes, I wanted to make popcorn just for you.

134
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 Oh, Hector, thank you. Oh, you are sweet.

135
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 I like popcorn too, Hector.

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
 -  Rock Thrust? What a stupid name!
 -  I know!

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
 Go, go, go, go, go!

138
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,559
 # Popcorn in your tummy

139
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 # They're Poptastic #

140
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
 Man, that is great!

141
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 Today, London, tomorrow, Hollywood.

142
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 Ah. I co- starred with Russell Crowe in this one.

143
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,518
 You, in Gladiator?

144
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,519
 Wow, Nick, I didn't realise. What were you?

145
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,559
 The centurion.

146
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,919
 Which centurion?

147
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 Er... Ah! Here it is.

148
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,838
 There, that's me, on the ground.

149
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,599
 Huh! A dead centurion.

150
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Yeah, good, eh?
 I had some words, but they were cut.

151
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
 -  What did you say?
 -  Erm...

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 Hey, but now I've got the whole script
 just for me on television every night.

153
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,999
 Nick, tell me.

154
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,119
 -  What is it?
 -  It's my show.

155
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,239
 When I'm a star, I will not forget you, my friend.

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,759
 ..at 5:30pm today

157
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 when I'll show you how to make
 a delicious chocolate mousse,

158
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,679
 a dessert for lovers.

159
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 You'll need chocolate, eggs and butter.

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 And don't forget the way to a heart
 is through the stomach.

161
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,239
 The way to the heart is through the stomach.
 What does that mean?

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 It means if you want a girlfriend, cook for her.

163
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
 I want to learn how to cook.

164
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 Anyway, what do you mean
 by I watch too many adverts?

165
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 Well, remember when you wanted us
 to change our washing powder?

166
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,239
 Oh- ho! Hello there.

167
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,479
 As a mother,
 I must fight difficult stains every day.

168
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,479
 Tomato ketchup.

169
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:43,239
 Chocolate...ooh!

170
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 Gravy.

171
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
 And...egg.

172
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,319
 But help is here.

173
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
 I will wash one shirt in ordinary washing powder

174
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,079
 and the other in new Zap!

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 So, the shirt
 washed in normal washing powder is...

176
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,599
 Oh! Still dirty.

177
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 But the shirt washed in new Zap! is...

178
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,519
 Oh.

179
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 Annie, have you seen my red T- shirt anywhere?

180
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,079
 Oops!

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
 See what I mean?

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
 -  Oh, hello, Bridget.
 -  Hello, Hector.

183
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,919
 Oh, hi, Annie.

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
 Oh, thank you. Yes, I know.

185
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,358
 Do you know where Nick is?

186
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,039
 -  No, we've just arrived.
 -  I'm a great actor.

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,118
 Erm, I think I know where Nick is.

188
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,119
 (Nick) ..love to do the part, but I'm too busy.

189
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,919
 No, it's not the money.

190
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,639
 I don't need 15 million quid.

191
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,559
 Look, talk to my agent, Bridget, hm?

192
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,118
 I have an idea.

193
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,119
 Oh. So Robert De Niro said yes already?

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 Hm? Well...

195
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello?

196
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,958
 -  Nick Jessop?
 -  Yeah.

197
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
 I have an executive from Warner Brothers
 on the line for you.

198
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,439
 Right.

199
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,479
 Hello, Nick.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 You are very big in England.

201
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,959
 What are you working on now?

202
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 Hi. Well, it's something
 that all of England watches.

203
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 It's the, erm...

204
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,999
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- ha.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,119
 You can laugh,

206
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
 but tomorrow night at six o'clock

207
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,239
 you will see that Nick from next door

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,598
 has star quality

209
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,599
 and then Spielberg will call.

210
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
 Now, excuse me, I must learn my line.

211
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,999
 Hello and welcome
 to the Chunky Chunks challenge.

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 New Zap!

213
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,919
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

214
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,279
 Hello, all you gorgeous chefs. Mwah.

215
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,159
 And welcome to Charlotte's Kitchen.

216
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,078
 Today...mmm...

217
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,079
 chocolate mousse, a dessert for lovers.

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
 -  First, take some chocolate.
 -  Chocolate.

219
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,398
 And melt it over hot water.

220
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,399
 Melt?

221
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,399
 Oh! Over hot water.

222
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,319
 Now, my darlings, you must
 separate the eggs into two bowls.

223
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 Separate the eggs?

224
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,559
 Separate the yolk from the white.

225
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,759
 Oh, the yolk from...

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,639
 -  Hector?
 -  Ah, hello, Annie.

227
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 Mix the yolk and the chocolate.

228
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,159
 Add the butter.

229
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
 And now for the fun -  whisking!

230
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,039
 I love whisking. Don't you?

231
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 -  Oh, whisking?
 -  Ah! You need Annie's magic whisk.

232
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 Yes, please.

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,599
 Nearly finished, my darlings.

234
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 Finally, add the whites to the chocolate

235
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,479
 and put it in the fridge.

236
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,518
 And in 30 minutes,

237
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,519
 this delicious chocolate mousse
 will be ready for your lover to taste -  mm!

238
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
 And put it in the fridge.

239
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,440
 Why, Hector, who's the lucky lady?

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 I think I know!

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Chocolate mousse, my favourite dessert.

242
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,799
 Nick! What time is it?

243
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 -  Six o'clock.
 -  Quick! Change channels!

244
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,159
 It's six o'clock
 and time for the weather with Rock Thrust!

245
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,199
 With Rock Thrust.

246
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,799
 Oh, me. I'm ready.

247
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 -  The weather?
 -  Rock Thrust?

248
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,438
 Nick!

249
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,439
 Hi! I'm Rock Thrust.

250
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,599
 -  Get on with it.
 -  Huh.

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 And here is the weather. Big smile.

252
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 And here is the weather.

253
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 In the south, it will be hot.

254
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,839
 Sun, sun.

255
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
 Oh, sorry. Hot.

256
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,679
 So put on your beach clothes.

257
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 And in the west, it'll be windy.

258
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
 And in the east, it will rain,

259
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,439
 so don't forget your, um...

260
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,199
 ..brella.

261
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
 And there could be some...

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 Oh, no. Not lightning.

263
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,879
 And that's the weather with me, Rock Thrust.

264
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 Ah, come in and sit down.

265
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,159
 Close your eyes.

266
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 Now, are you ready for a taste of paradise?

267
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:38,399
 Chocolate so smooth

268
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,999
 it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.

269
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
 Ready?

270
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,080
 Mmm!

271
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

272
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,239
 Oh, Hector, that was so much fun!

273
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,439
 I love doing adverts,
 especially with your delicious chocolate mousse.

274
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 Oh, I'm glad you like it.

275
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,399
 Well, hello! It's Rock Thrust.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,559
 Would you like your messages, Mr Thrust?

277
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,318
 As your agent, I take ten per cent.

278
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,319
 Oh, poor Nick. You must be very tired now.

279
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,278
 Yeah, I am.

280
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,279
 Working in television must be exhausting.

281
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,359
 Yes, because I had to run
 all the way from the studio.

282
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,158
 Run? Why?

283
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,159
 Because I was chased.

284
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,719
 Next time in Extra...

285
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Bridget wins the lottery.

286
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,839
 Nick finds love at the traffic lights.

287
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 And why does Hector become a dustman?

288
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:21,879
 And why does Hector become a dustman?

289
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
