1
00:00:03,80 --> 00:00:08,870
being a princess sometimes i think that
i would like to be a princess a Princess

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,790
would live in a palace and wear
beautiful clothes she would have

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,640
servants to do chores for her and she
would probably marry a handsome prince

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,910
people would recognize her they would
wave to her as she drove by it seems

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,130
like it would be a lot of fun to be a
princess but maybe it wouldn't be so

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,750
nice

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,809
maybe it would be terrible to be
recognized by everyone

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,199
maybe a princess would feel like
everyone was watching her she would have

9
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:42,979
to look nice

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,330
every time she left the palace there
would always be people with cameras who

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,119
wanted to take her picture a princess
would have no privacy even in her own

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,839
palace

13
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:59,330
there would be servants around so she
would never really be alone if I were a

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,260
princess

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,260
I would worry about security for my
family

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,780
sometimes people who are in high
positions are threatened by other people

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,990
that would be a worry I'm not so sure
that being a princess would be all that

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,979
much fun

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,610
I think it might be better to be just a
normal person like me

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,990
I don't have to worry about looking
wonderful all the time

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,820
people don't follow me around and take
my picture whenever you see a picture of

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,679
a princess she is smiling

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,540
I wonder if she's smiling on the inside
or just smiling for the camera

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,810
my worst fear I am afraid of water

25
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't know why i am afraid i have
never had a bad experience in the water

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,600
I just never learned to swim I should
have done that when I was just little it

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,789
would be easier for me to swim now if i
had started when i was young i will go

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,990
into the shallow water but I start to
panic when the water gets higher than my

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,980
chest

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,880
I don't like the feeling of not being
able to put my feet on the bottom of the

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
pool or the lake

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I don't like to get water up my nose I
choke and cough when that happens my

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,120
friends just tell me to relax and i will
float but i find it hard to relax in

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,170
deep water

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,570
they keep telling me that if I panic i
will think most of my friends have had

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,829
swimming lessons

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,440
some of them are even lifeguards they
have tried to teach me to swim but I

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
think I need to go to a place where they
actually teach swimming

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,000
it would be nice to jump into a pool of
cold water on a hot summer day

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,709
that would be so refreshing if I go out
onto a boat

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,130
I always wear a life jacket I think it
is wise to do that everyone should wear

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
a life jacket on a boat

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:08,830
I would rather be safe than sorry I have
decided that I will overcome my fear I

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,750
will go and take swimming lessons

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,110
I have a goal by this time next year

46
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,950
I would like to be able to swim the
length of the pool without being afraid

47
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,30
it is best to face your fears and deal
with them

48
00:03:22,30 --> 00:03:25,30
I hope that I can overcome my fear of
water

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,420
if I live to be 100 i think i would like
to live to be 100

50
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,819
it seems like an awfully long time to
live it is an entire century

51
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,290
imagine all the changes that you would
see if you live to be 100

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,260
I had a neighbor who was 85 she used to
tell me what things were like when she

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,880
was a little girl she told me what my
town used to look like what her clothes

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,280
were like and what her school was like I
used to enjoy listening to her stories

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,370
everything was so different when she was
young

56
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,370
listening to her was like having history
come to life

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,250
I used to try to imagine what life was
like for her back then if I was a

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
hundred and I had grandchildren and
great-grandchildren

59
00:04:21,29 --> 00:04:26,10
I would tell them stories about my
childhood I would hope that I had a good

60
00:04:26,10 --> 00:04:28,860
memory so that I could remember
everything

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
if i do want to live to 100

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,510
I'll have to have a healthy lifestyle
not too many people live to be that old

63
00:04:37,20 --> 00:04:42,570
if I do get to be that old I hope I'll
still be mentally alert and physically

64
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,390
agile in my country

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,650
the Prime Minister sends a letter of
congratulations to anyone who has their

66
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,969
hundredth birthday

67
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,970
people who live to be 100 are very
special

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,330
maybe in the future with better medical
care and healthier lifestyles more

69
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,680
people will live to be 100 if I live to
be 100 all have a birthday cake but I

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,140
won't put 100 candles on the cake

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I could never blow out 100 candles

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,490
what I like most and least about myself
I was trying to think of the best and

73
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,530
the worst things about myself

74
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,888
I think the best thing about me is that
i am very friendly

75
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,69
I have a lot of friends and they all
like me

76
00:05:38,69 --> 00:05:43,229
I try to be good to my friends I don't
often have arguments with people i think

77
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,210
that i am quite easy to get along with
the worst thing about me is that I

78
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,940
sometimes feel sad sometimes I don't
feel sad for any particular reason I

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,909
just get into moods where I am depressed
sometimes there is a reason to be sad I

80
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:05,940
was sad when my pet frog died I was sad
when I lost my favorite baseball card on

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,750
those days

82
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,979
I'm still nice to my friends but inside
I feel like there is a heavyweight in my

83
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,909
chest

84
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,949
I think that everyone feel sadness
sometimes I try to do things that make

85
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:17,819
me happy

86
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,250
whenever I get into one of my sad moods
last Saturday I felt a bit sad so I

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,550
called up my friend John and asked him
if he wanted to go to the movies

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,860
we went to a comedy we laughed all the
way through the movie so that by the

89
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,190
time the movie was over I didn't feel
sad anymore

90
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,610
my friendliness is my best trait and my
sad moods are my worst traits i have to

91
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,979
work at getting over my sad moves more
quickly being sad doesn't do anyone any

92
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:47,849
good

93
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,849
there is no use and feeling sorry for
oneself

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,740
the trunk in the Attic last month my
grandmother asked me if I could help her

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,120
to clean out her attic

96
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,860
I was happy that she asked me my
grandmother says that our attic is full

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,60
of junk

98
00:07:14,60 --> 00:07:18,530
I think that our attic is full of
treasures I helped her to dust and

99
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,849
vacuum the Attic

100
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,60
I pulled and pushed around boxes and
crates

101
00:07:23,60 --> 00:07:26,210
I helped her to wash the floors and
walls

102
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,919
my favorite thing that I did was to sort
through the old trunk that she had up

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,790
there

104
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,320
the trunk had a rusty latch on it it was
a bit difficult to open

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,260
but my grandmother got a knife and pride
the latch open the trunk was full of all

106
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,670
kinds of things

107
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,800
there are lots of clothes some of the
clothes had been my grandmother's there

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,220
was a blue velvet dress that she had
worn to a dance when she and my

109
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,720
grandfather were dating

110
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,560
it was a beautiful dress but there were
a few more holes in it

111
00:07:58,70 --> 00:08:02,480
there were some of my mother's old
clothes there was a pair of bell-bottom

112
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,730
slacks that had bright flowers on it

113
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,780
I couldn't believe that my mother had
ever worn something like that

114
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,840
there were some of my mother's old
report cards

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,000
some of her marks weren't very good I
had fun reading the report cards

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,830
there were photographs there was a
picture of my grandparents holding my

117
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,570
mother when she was a baby

118
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,409
there was an old baseball glove that one
of my uncle's had owned

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,390
there was even one of my old dolls in
there one of her legs was missing my

120
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,679
grandmother said that I was rough on my
dolls when i was little i should have

121
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,719
taken better care of my toys

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,910
there was even some old jewelry I tried
on some of the old clothes and jewelry

123
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,930
I told my grandmother that I like
looking through old things

124
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,140
my grandmother told me to keep whatever
I wanted

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,950
she said that it was all junk I still
say that her trunk was full of treasures

126
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,199
hot and cold I noticed that whenever it
is summer people complain about the heat

127
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,99
but whenever it is winter people
complain about the cold

128
00:09:19,29 --> 00:09:22,29
it seems that people are never satisfied

129
00:09:23,50 --> 00:09:28,839
I don't like the winter it is usually
much too cold for me my teeth chatter

130
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,300
and my fingers turn them whenever the
weather gets cold it is hard for me to

131
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,339
warm up once i start to freeze

132
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,470
I try to wear layers of clothes but
winter winds go through my clothes

133
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,480
no matter how much i wear my feet feel
like they are blocks of ice on a cold

134
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,850
January day when I walk home from school
I would not like to live in a place that

135
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,130
had cold climate all year long

136
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,189
I am not comfortable when it is too cold

137
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,949
I like the summer some people say that
it is hot and sticky in the summer but I

138
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,810
don't mind the heat at all

139
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,529
I love to feel the warm sunshine on my
skin

140
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,790
I like the freedom of not having to wear
heavy coats and boots

141
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,50
I am the happiest when there is a
slightly cool breeze that comes along to

142
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:19,389
refresh you on a hot summer day

143
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,870
I could live in a place with a hot
climate I would enjoy that

144
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:28,540
of course when you are in a place with a
hot climate there are more bugs than in

145
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,370
places with cooler climates

146
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,670
I don't care for bugs where I live

147
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,750
it is very humid the heat and moisture
combined to make it uncomfortable

148
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,260
sometimes it is nicer when the heat is
high but the humidity is low it would be

149
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,100
better if I live somewhere where it was
hot but not humid

150
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
that would be just perfect

151
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,630
walk a mile in my shoes have you ever
heard the saying walk a mile in my shoes

152
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,569
I think it's a very good thing do you
know what it means it means that before

153
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,490
you judge someone you should put
yourself in his or her position for

154
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,530
example if someone was running in a race
and they did very poorly and came in

155
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,430
last

156
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,849
it wouldn't be fair to say oh he's just
a terrible runner

157
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,750
you would have to look at all the
circumstances that made the person lose

158
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,590
the race

159
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,590
maybe they pulled a muscle in their leg
the day before

160
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,290
maybe this is their very first race
maybe they are not in good form because

161
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,910
something isn't right in their lives
there can be so many things that affect

162
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,610
a person's life performance and moods

163
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,550
there can be so many things that affect
a person's life performance and moods

164
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,870
if someone was very quiet at a party you
couldn't just assume that they weren't

165
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,920
friendly

166
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,689
you don't know what is happening in
their lives they could be feeling ill or

167
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,60
they might have just had a bad
experience

168
00:12:07,60 --> 00:12:12,819
nobody can know exactly how another
person feels even if someone tells you

169
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,620
what he or she is experiencing you still
won't fully understand what is going on

170
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,50
inside the other person everyone
perceives and feels things differently

171
00:12:23,50 --> 00:12:28,479
to walk a mile in someone else's shoes
is to try and understand things from

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,310
that person's perspective we are all
shaped by the events that have taken

173
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,229
place in our lives

174
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,890
no two people have gone through the
exact same things

175
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,990
so before you are quick to judge someone
stop and think about what it is that

176
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,790
they might have gone through

177
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,260
you won't always understand why people
do what they do but you can try to

178
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,260
understand and put yourself in their
position

179
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,710
if I could go back in my life if I could
go back in my life and do some things

180
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,640
differently

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,140
this is what i would do I would not
waste so many hours in front of the

182
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,790
television set

183
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:23,459
I would get out and enjoy my life rather
than watching actors and shows i would

184
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,370
be a little more considerate of other
people

185
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,440
I would realize that my mother has more
to do and pick up after me i would pay

186
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,460
more attention in school tests are
easier when you have paid attention

187
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,650
rather than fooling around in class I
would save more money rather than spend

188
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,380
it on useless things i would read more
reading is enjoyable and it opens the

189
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,320
doors into all kinds of wonderful places
both real and imagined I would learn to

190
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,410
play an instrument music is always
appreciated if it is played well I would

191
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,640
eat better foods

192
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,300
I would try to stay healthy through my
diet and exercise

193
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I would take more pictures and I would
keep a journal

194
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,420
memories are very precious i would take
the time to listen to what people have

195
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,349
to say

196
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,839
people appreciate a good listener I
would take the time to enjoy each day as

197
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:19,890
it comes

198
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,540
sometimes I am so busy looking forward
to what is coming up that I don't take

199
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,150
the time to enjoy the day that i am
living in

200
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,150
that's what I would do if I could go
back in my life

201
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,100
in fact I think I'll just make a habit
of doing all of those things all through

202
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
my life

203
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,829
joking joking is good jokes can be very
funny jokes can also be hurtful jokes

204
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,810
can be tasteless -

205
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,69
it is not an easy thing to find jokes
that do not offend anyone

206
00:15:00,70 --> 00:15:04,89
some jokes make fun of different races
those jokes are not funny

207
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,570
they are hurtful it is not right to tell
racist jokes many jokes use bad language

208
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,990
or are about questionable subject matter

209
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,779
these jokes are also not acceptable many
people are highly offended by rude jokes

210
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,779
what some people find funny others will
not

211
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,160
comedy is a very personal thing some
people like slapstick comedy

212
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,689
that is the kind of comedy that the
three stooges use some people like very

213
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,70
subtle humor

214
00:15:33,70 --> 00:15:37,300
some people will laugh at just about
anything sometimes it is not appropriate

215
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,389
to laugh but you feel like laughing
anyway

216
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,230
did you ever see anyone fall down did
you feel like laughing when they fell

217
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,980
down

218
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,449
you are probably worried that they had
hurt themselves yet the way that they

219
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:54,310
fell was so funny that you felt like
laughing it's not funny when someone

220
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,89
falls but you can't help but laugh even
though you try to hide it

221
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:04,240
jokes and comedy differ from culture to
culture many people from other countries

222
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,970
come here and don't understand our
comedy jokes and comedies are often

223
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,160
geared toward our environment sometimes
comedians make fun of the things that we

224
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,630
do in our day-to-day lives like going to
the bank are going grocery shopping

225
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,500
we can all relate to that being a
comedian is not an easy job telling

226
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
jokes and making people laugh is
extremely difficult

227
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,889
jokes are fun and they are funny if they
are good jokes can get you into a lot of

228
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,660
trouble if they are inappropriate and
sometimes they're just not funny

229
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,850
and nobody laughs here's a joke why does
the cow wear a bell

230
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,600
because its horns don't work do you get
it

231
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,660
do you think it is funny

232
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,579
well maybe it's not that funny I told
you that it was difficult being a

233
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,579
comedian

234
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,859
drugs there are two different types of
drugs

235
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,839
there are legal drugs and there are
illegal drugs legal drugs are the type

236
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,419
of drugs that the doctor gives you when
you were sick

237
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,480
illegal drugs are the drugs that people
sell on the street

238
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,960
illegal drugs are very dangerous if
someone ever wants you to try any type

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,660
of substance that you are not sure about
you should always say no people who sell

240
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,880
drugs on the street are criminals

241
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,150
if they get caught they will be sent to
jail

242
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,790
they sell drugs to get money they don't
care that people's lives are ruined from

243
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,930
taking drugs

244
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,950
if you take illegal drugs you can become
addicted to them

245
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,190
that means that you just have to have
the drug no matter what some people

246
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,40
steal from other people to get money to
buy drugs drugs affect your mind if you

247
00:18:03,40 --> 00:18:03,879
take drugs

248
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,160
you will not be able to think clearly
your marks in school drop your memory

249
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,750
won't be very good

250
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,750
your personality won't be the same

251
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,870
it is very unfortunate that some people
do try drugs they think that it won't

252
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,989
hurt them they are wrong if you are
smart you will stay away from all drugs

253
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,50
except for the ones that the doctor
gives you

254
00:18:29,50 --> 00:18:33,790
drugs are just bad news if you know
someone who is thinking about trying

255
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,820
drugs tell them that their entire life
could be ruined

256
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,560
in America they have a saying just say
no to drugs

257
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:48,310
it is a good saying but i think i would
rather say I'm just too smart to take

258
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,310
drugs

259
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,740
divorce

260
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,809
Mary's parents just got a divorce Mary
is very upset

261
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,370
she thinks that her parents don't love
her anymore she thinks that they got a

262
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,370
divorce because of her she is wrong

263
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,290
her parents love her just as much as
they always did they aren't getting

264
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,210
divorced because of Mary

265
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,679
sometimes marriages just don't work out
it isn't really anyone's fault

266
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,929
marriage isn't easy it is hard for two
people to stay together for a lifetime

267
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,158
sometimes people change as they get
older and they move on

268
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,210
some people have perfectly good
marriages and they stay together for

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,890
their entire lives

270
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,480
divorce doesn't happen because the
parents don't love the children anymore

271
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,710
a lot of children feel that it is their
fault but it isn't their fault at all

272
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,850
children either caused the divorce nor
can they prevent it

273
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,408
it is up to the parents divorce isn't
the end of the world

274
00:19:57,10 --> 00:20:00,279
children can still see both parents and
stay with them

275
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,559
life goes on sometimes children can get
new stepmothers or stepfathers that can

276
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,730
be a good thing

277
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,659
you just have to be understanding and
know that your parents still love you

278
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,610
life doesn't always go the way that we
planned it but it has its twists and

279
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,750
turns

280
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,750
life is an adventure if your parents got
a divorce

281
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:25,149
just be understanding know that they
love you and that this is a hard time

282
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,20
for them

283
00:20:26,20 --> 00:20:30,158
it is a hard time for you to but these
things have a way of working themselves

284
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,159
out in the end

285
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,130
if my fish could talk

286
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,880
I have a goldfish he swims around in his
bowl all day

287
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,000
he looks bored I look inside the bowl
and watch him his mouth always moves

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,730
he looks like he is talking I imagine
what my goldfish would say if he really

289
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,80
could talk

290
00:21:00,80 --> 00:21:03,740
I think he would say hey i'm bored in
this little Bowl

291
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,70
why don't you get me a bigger tank with
more fish in it

292
00:21:07,70 --> 00:21:10,70
I would like to have some friends to
swim around with

293
00:21:11,90 --> 00:21:14,659
I went out and bought a bigger tank for
my goldfish

294
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,440
I put some plants at the bottom of the
tank and I got a miniature deep sea

295
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,50
diver to put at the bottom of the tank

296
00:21:21,50 --> 00:21:25,820
I looked into the tank and imagine what
my goldfish was saying he seemed to be

297
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,639
saying this is a nice tank

298
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,20
it's roomy in here and you decorated it
well but i still don't have any friends

299
00:21:33,20 --> 00:21:38,480
to swim with i went to the pet store and
bought three more gold fish

300
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,770
I put them into the tank all of the
goldfish seem to look at each other they

301
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,129
swim near each other and seem to be
playing games

302
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,200
I knew which one was my goldfish because
he has a black spot on his fin

303
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,10
I looked at him and imagine that he was
talking again

304
00:21:55,10 --> 00:22:01,10
he said this is great i have a big new
home and friends to swim with these are

305
00:22:01,10 --> 00:22:03,680
nice goldfish that you brought home for
me

306
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,800
thank you goldfish can't really talk

307
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,120
i know that i just like to pretend that
my goldfish talks he seems very happy

308
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,360
now with his nice new home and his new
friends

309
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't think goldfish can smile either
but it looks like my goldfish has a

310
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
smile on his face

311
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:32,630
the best teacher

312
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,40
I have had a lot of teachers some of
them are good and some of them are

313
00:22:37,40 --> 00:22:37,940
boring

314
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,650
there is one teacher whom I remember
very well he is the best teacher that I

315
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,880
ever had

316
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,60
his name was mr. Alvin he was a history
teacher

317
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,440
history is not my favorite subject

318
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,60
I don't really enjoy history a lot when
I was in mr. albums class he made

319
00:22:56,60 --> 00:22:57,860
history seem exciting

320
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,149
he was more of an actor than a teacher
if he was describing a war he would make

321
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,600
us feel all the emotions that the
soldiers and their families would have

322
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,550
felt we could almost hear the guns
firing and the people shouting he would

323
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,919
paint a picture in our minds that was
very vivid when I had a history test in

324
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,610
this class

325
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,409
I didn't have to study much I would
remember every word that he had said I

326
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,890
would see him doing the actions that
went along with his stories

327
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,570
he was very animated he would shout out
orders as if he was a general or you

328
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,110
would speak softly and reverently when
describing the death of a great hero

329
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,510
the most important thing that I learned
from mr. Albin was that I did really

330
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,890
like history

331
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,610
I just thought that I didn't like it
because most people had made a doll by

332
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,740
just reading from the textbooks

333
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,220
history is not just a series of dates
and all facts

334
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,310
history is what really happened history
is real life

335
00:23:53,90 --> 00:23:57,770
all the historical figures had real
families and emotions they weren't just

336
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,570
fictional people after i took history
for mr. Alvin I realized that I really

337
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,820
did have an interest in it

338
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,80
he was my favorite teacher and I will
always be grateful to him for making me

339
00:24:09,80 --> 00:24:12,350
aware of just how interesting history
really is

340
00:24:23,59 --> 00:24:25,59
weather

341
00:24:25,59 --> 00:24:28,629
sometimes I watch the Weathermen on
television

342
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:32,379
it is fascinating to watch them . to
different areas of the country on the

343
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,39
map

344
00:24:33,39 --> 00:24:36,549
he tells us where the weather will be
nice and where it will be bad

345
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,960
the weatherman is not always right
weather reporting is not an exact

346
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,740
science

347
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,179
nothing is very exact when it comes to
the weather the weather department does

348
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,659
a lot of research but they can never be
sure of exactly what will happen

349
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,490
sometimes it looks like it will be clear
but the wind changes direction and

350
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,869
clouds move in the weatherman can warn
people if there is a chance of a

351
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,580
hurricane or tornado

352
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,320
the weatherman can also warn people of
floods sometimes entire towns have to be

353
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,570
evacuated because of bad weather

354
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,39
it is important to be aware of the
weather for example it is not good to be

355
00:25:12,39 --> 00:25:15,309
caught in the middle of a field when
there is going to be a thunderstorm

356
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,399
you might want to take extra precautions
if there is going to be a heavy

357
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,479
snowstorm

358
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,379
you would need to be in a secure place
of a hurricane or tornado was predicted

359
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:28,240
you might want to cancel a picnic if you
knew that it would rain that day the

360
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,369
weather affects us in so many ways

361
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,428
some people are really affected by dog
cloudy days

362
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,19
if there are no sunny days they become
very depressed heavy air pressure can

363
00:25:38,19 --> 00:25:42,789
cause some people to have headaches
weather affect all of us in one way or

364
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,999
another it is always a topic of
conversation

365
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:49,29
people often say things like hello it's
a beautiful day today

366
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:53,590
often we plan our lives and activities
around the weather

367
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,490
so if you are planning on walking home
tonight keep an eye on the sky

368
00:25:58,90 --> 00:26:01,90
are those rain clouds up there you might
need an umbrella

369
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
how to avoid catching a cold

370
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,20
how many calls do you catch in a year
most of my friends catch quite a few

371
00:26:20,20 --> 00:26:24,730
colts they cough sniffle and sneeze to
carry around tissues and blow their

372
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,230
noses all the time

373
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,30
their eyes water and they have scratchy
throats I don't get many colds in fact i

374
00:26:31,30 --> 00:26:33,940
can go for a whole year and never catch
a cold

375
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,420
this is why i consider myself an expert
on how not to catch a cold

376
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,150
I'll tell you how to avoid catching a
cult I think that you need to take a lot

377
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,410
of vitamin C

378
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,270
I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables I
drink fruit juice - I also take vitamin

379
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,320
c pills

380
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,100
whenever I begin to feel a cold coming
on I make sure that I have taken my

381
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,449
vitamin C pill and I drink a lot of
orange juice that usually knocks the

382
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,640
cold right out of my system

383
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,260
I make sure that I get a lot of fresh
air in the winter a lot of buildings are

384
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,340
shut up tight so that the air is stale
and people's germs circulate through the

385
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,340
building's I get outside and breathe in
fresh clean air if somebody is rude

386
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,570
enough to confer sneeze right in front
of me without covering his or her mouth

387
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,10
I just hold my breath for a second I'm
not sure if this works or not but I

388
00:27:24,10 --> 00:27:28,570
don't want to breathe in anybody's cold
germs many germs are passed through

389
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,530
hands

390
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,740
it is important to wash your hands
thoroughly if you touch anything in a

391
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,790
public place

392
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,970
if I hold a banister while I'm walking
down the stairs

393
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,750
I think of all the people who have used
that banister and I make sure that I

394
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,120
wash my hands before I eat

395
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,320
door knobs also have a lot of germs on
them money is another thing that is

396
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,710
passed from hand to hand and is covered
with germs

397
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,70
sometimes I see people stick money into
their mouths

398
00:27:54,70 --> 00:27:56,679
just think of all the germs that you
would be putting into your mouth if you

399
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,670
did that

400
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,960
if you just give it a little bit of
thought you can avoid a lot of germs

401
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,100
that cause colts if you eat good food
and stay fit your body will be able to

402
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,100
fight off the germs that cause colds and
other diseases

403
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,290
it is not always possible to avoid cold
but if you do catch a cold drink plenty

404
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,290
of fluids and get a lot of rest

405
00:28:25,49 --> 00:28:26,658
the future

406
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:30,979
I sometimes wonder what life will be
like in the future life has changed so

407
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,289
much in just the past few years

408
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,710
I'm sure that there are still big
changes that are coming

409
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,720
do you think will still drive cars maybe
we'll get into computerized vehicles

410
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,679
that we won't have to drive will just
push a few buttons and the vehicles will

411
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,19
take us to where ever we have to go

412
00:28:48,19 --> 00:28:51,320
maybe there won't be roads you might
just fly through space to get where we

413
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,509
want to go instead of telephones we'll
just use our computers will be able to

414
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:00,379
see each other when we talk that type of
thing is already happening

415
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:05,330
maybe we won't have to cook our meals we
might be able to push buttons to order

416
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,918
whatever we want a nice roast beef
dinner or an ice cream sundae might just

417
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,639
pop out of a machine would be nice to
have a robot to clean the house for you

418
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:19,99
in the past few years computers have
been extremely important people used to

419
00:29:19,99 --> 00:29:20,928
write to each other through the mail

420
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:24,499
now people communicate so much more
frequently through email

421
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,669
most of my friends own computers if we
had all of these things to do the work

422
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:29,419
for us

423
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:33,769
what would we do we would still need
people to program the computers we could

424
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,749
spend more time being creative

425
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:41,330
rather than doing everyday chores the
future holds many surprises

426
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,439
I'm sure that technology will become
even more and more amazing when my

427
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,529
parents were young they had never even
seen a color television

428
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,658
nobody owned a computer it doesn't take
long for things to change a lot

429
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,659
who knows what amazing things are in
store for us

430
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,370
giving a speech

431
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,110
I had to give a speech last week I gave
a speech - 300 people have to speak in

432
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,639
front of a group of students

433
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,970
I had to tell them about a campaign that
we were having to raise money for cancer

434
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,230
research

435
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,370
giving a speech can be a difficult thing
when you stand in front of a big crowd

436
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,930
you can get very nervous some people
feel like they have weak knees their

437
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,40
legs feel as if they are made of rubber
their heartbeats very hard inside of

438
00:30:28,40 --> 00:30:30,320
their chests their palms get sweaty

439
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,460
some people even become short of breath
for some people giving a speech is their

440
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,100
worst fear when you give a speech

441
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,270
everyone is looking at you they're
waiting to hear what you have to say

442
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,480
when you have 300 people looking at you

443
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
you have six hundred eyes that are on
you it is a little frightening when you

444
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,530
think of it that way before I give a
speech

445
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,870
I take three big breaths I call myself
and I remind myself that what I have to

446
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,610
say is important

447
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,389
I like to be sure of what i am going to
say so I practice my speech in front of

448
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,770
a mirror at home

449
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,889
I like to look like I am relaxed and
friendly

450
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,880
they say that practice makes perfect so
the more speeches that you give the

451
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,929
better you will become at it whenever I
have to give a speech

452
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,309
I imagine that the audience is just one
big person I look out into the audience

453
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,100
until I find a friendly smiling face

454
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,330
I focus on that person and I pretend
that I am just talking to them

455
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,520
I've become used to giving speeches I'm
more relaxed now than I used to be

456
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,850
people tell me that i do not look
nervous at all

457
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,199
I like to hear that sometimes I do feel
a little flutter of nervousness but I

458
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,960
just ignore it and do the best that I
can

459
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,920
giving a speech is not as scary as it
appears to be anyone can do it with a

460
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,920
little practice

461
00:31:54,70 --> 00:31:57,290
moving to another country

462
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,180
my friend Steve moved to another country
he had lived in Canada all his life and

463
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,380
he moved to Japan life in japan was very
different for Steve than what he was

464
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,640
used to at first steve suffered from
culture shock

465
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,990
his whole life seem different he was not
used to the way of life in Japan

466
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,580
steve was not used to the large crowds
of people that walked up and down the

467
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,550
streets in japan in his hometown in
Canada

468
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,930
the streets were fairly quiet Steve had
to get used to the food in Japan the

469
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,670
people eat a lot of fish

470
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,970
Steve had never eaten much fish before
Steve wanted pizza

471
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,800
but it was expensive in Japan steve said
that he had to adjust his eating habits

472
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,990
the people in Japan have different
customs then we do here in Canada

473
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,919
Steve didn't want to offend anyone so we
had to learn the customs

474
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,530
he had to learn about what Japanese
people considered polite and fruit

475
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,700
sometimes in a foreign country you can
do something to insult someone without

476
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,580
even realizing that you are being rude

477
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,260
at first steve had trouble with the
language he said that the only way to

478
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,810
really learn the language is to talk to
people

479
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,340
Steve talked to a lot of people he made
a lot of mistakes but people were

480
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,870
patients with him and they tried to help
him with his Japanese it wasn't long

481
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,870
before steve felt more comfortable in
his new surroundings

482
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,250
you have to be willing to learn new
customs and a new language if you move

483
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,110
to another country c feels very
comfortable in japan and in canada now

484
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,669
he is thinking about going to another
country now he thinks that he might like

485
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,410
to try and live in Italy

486
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,10
I'm sure that he would get over his
culture shock very fast if he moved

487
00:33:37,10 --> 00:33:37,670
there

488
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,230
moving to a new country can be difficult
but if you are willing to learn

489
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,230
it can be a very rewarding experience

490
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,190
look for the beauty

491
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,740
I've learned that things don't always go
the way that they were planned

492
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,120
if something doesn't happen the way that
I wanted to I try to make the best of

493
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
the situation

494
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
I always try to find something good and
everything that happens

495
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,780
last year I broke my ankle when I was
walking on an icy sidewalk at first I

496
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,30
was very upset i was missing school and
there was a party that I wanted to go to

497
00:34:18,30 --> 00:34:21,750
I couldn't do very much of anything my
ankle was very sore

498
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,650
I stayed home and I read a book it was
an excellent book and one that I

499
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,280
probably would not have had time to read
under normal circumstances

500
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,630
my friends brought my homework to my
house and we had some really nice visits

501
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,830
while they were here

502
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,29
I had to accept the fact that i couldn't
go anywhere on my broken ankle so i made

503
00:34:39,30 --> 00:34:41,430
the best of a bad situation

504
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,909
once I lost my way when I was out
camping

505
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,719
I ended up in a very large field was
afraid that nobody would find me but I

506
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,589
calmed myself down and took time to
examine all the interesting wildflowers

507
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,610
in the field

508
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,270
my family did find me they're surprised
at how calm I was

509
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,200
I've learned that there is something
valuable inside every adventure and

510
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,759
something beautiful inside every person
we had a new boy who came into our class

511
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,20
his clothes origin style and he was not
particularly handsome

512
00:35:10,20 --> 00:35:14,130
some of the boys and girls made fun of
him sometimes people can be really cruel

513
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,300
he seemed to handle it all right but
inside I knew that it must hurt

514
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,40
some of my friends and i invited him out
with us we found out that he had a

515
00:35:23,40 --> 00:35:27,240
terrific sense of humor and he is
probably one of the nicest people I've

516
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,379
ever met

517
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,850
he has since become one of my best
friends makes me ashamed when someone

518
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,460
that I know judge someone by how they
look

519
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,870
it isn't fair to do that you'll find
that something good comes out of almost

520
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,759
every situation

521
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
you'll find something good about almost
everyone that you meet

522
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,660
if you look hard enough if something
doesn't work out the way you planned it

523
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,680
just make the best of the situation look
for the beauty in everything

524
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,290
my doll

525
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,90
when I was an infant I got a rag doll it
was a very plain little doll and it wore

526
00:36:04,90 --> 00:36:06,430
a clown outfit and a clown's hat

527
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,149
I used to take back dolls to bed with me
every night I couldn't go to bed without

528
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,990
my doll

529
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,649
my mother used to pretend that the doll
was talking to me she would make the dog

530
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,420
dance and sing songs

531
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,920
I would talk to the doll my mother would
answer for the doll but I was a baby

532
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,510
I thought that the doll was actually
talking to me that doll was my best

533
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,380
friend

534
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,340
I took her everywhere one time I took
her to a store with me and I left her on

535
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,810
a shelf in the store

536
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,740
we were halfway home when I realized
that didn't have my doll with me

537
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,370
I was very upset my mother and I rushed
back to the store

538
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,720
my doll was still there I was so
relieved I hug my doll and I promised

539
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,629
myself I would never leave her anywhere
again

540
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,500
I couldn't imagine life without that
doll through the years the doll became

541
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,580
less important in my life and other
things to do but the dogs still sat on

542
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,200
my bed during the day and I still took
it to bed at night I gave that doll a

543
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
lot of love when I was little

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,470
in fact I loved that doll so much that
she looks tattered and torn now there

545
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,560
are parts of her face and hands are
almost worn away

546
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,820
I have a lot of other toys when I was
little but none of them were ever so

547
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,830
important as that doll

548
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,759
I don't play with toys anymore but that
doll is still in my room

549
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,870
she sits in a special chair in the
corner I'll always have that doll

550
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,190
no matter how worn out she is always
keep her and cherish her as part of my

551
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,710
early child

552
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,30
childhood child
