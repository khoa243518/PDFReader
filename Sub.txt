3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,641
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

4
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,962
You're going out with a guy.

5
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,521
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,723
All right, Joey, be nice.

7
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,532
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

8
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,366
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

9
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,644
I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

10
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,405
Okay, everybody relax.

11
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:18,449
Relax. This is not even a date.

12
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:22,480
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

13
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,971
Sounds like a date to me.

14
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,451
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

15
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,684
. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

16
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,850
I've had that dream.

17
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,721
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

18
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,125
. . .there.

19
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,004
-Instead of--
-That's right!

20
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,811
That one, I've never had.

21
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:52,204
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

22
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,290
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,363
They weren't looking at you before?

24
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,725
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

25
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,332
And it turns out it's my mother.

26
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:10,326
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

27
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:22,531
This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

28
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,281
You okay, sweetie?

29
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:29,803
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

30
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,725
-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

31
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,171
Carol moved out today.

32
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,328
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

33
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:47,526
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

34
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,447
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

35
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,922
Fine. Be murky.

36
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:56,284
I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

37
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,447
No, you don't.

38
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,728
To hell with her. She left me!

39
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,127
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

40
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:11,451
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

41
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,526
She didn't know.
How should I know?

42
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,932
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

43
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,728
Did I say that out loud?

44
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,522
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.

45
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:33,970
Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. . .

46
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,442
. . . ''I'll never have grandchildren! ''

47
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,728
Was, what? A wrong number?

48
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:40,731
Sorry.

49
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:44,164
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

50
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,721
You're angry. You're hurting.

51
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,122
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

52
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,606
Strip joints!

53
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,922
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

54
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,322
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

55
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,330
I just want to be married again.

56
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,843
And I just want a million dollars!

57
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:13,921
Rachel?

58
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,561
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

59
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:19,724
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

60
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,207
. . .that you might be here and you are.

61
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,524
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

62
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,968
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

63
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,732
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe. . .

64
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,167
. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

65
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:36,322
Sure!

66
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:50,130
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

67
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:56,128
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

68
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:58,840
I was in this room with
all the presents. . .

69
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,128
. . .and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

70
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,722
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

71
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:07,321
When all of a sudden I realize--
Sweet 'N Low?

72
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,848
I realized. . .

73
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:13,687
. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

74
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,565
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

75
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:19,326
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

76
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,925
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

77
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,923
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

78
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,602
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

79
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:37,050
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

80
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,931
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

81
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,770
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

82
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,925
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

83
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,242
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

84
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,926
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

85
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:07,481
''Tuna or egg salad?''

86
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,847
''Decide! ''

87
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:13,723
''I'll have whatever
Christine is having. ''

88
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:18,169
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

89
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,171
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,926
I just don't love him.

91
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,682
Well, it matters to me!

92
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:33,325
''If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off. ''

93
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,445
She should not be
wearing those pants.

94
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,763
I say push her down the stairs!

95
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,606
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

96
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,444
Come on, Daddy, listen!

97
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:54,487
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

98
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,407
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

99
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,564
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

100
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:04,248
What if I want to be a purse?

101
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,726
Or a hat?''

102
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:09,041
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

103
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,328
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

104
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,321
You can see where he'd have trouble.

105
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,763
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

106
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,324
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

107
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,330
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

108
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,522
Well, maybe that's my decision.

109
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,728
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

110
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,729
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

111
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,565
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

112
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,121
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

113
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:55,042
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

114
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:59,205
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

115
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:03,362
La la la something
And noodles with string

116
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,728
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

117
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,125
I helped.

118
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:13,447
This is probably for
the best, you know?

119
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,852
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

120
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,650
The whole ''hat'' thing.

121
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:23,044
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

122
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,443
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

123
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,726
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

124
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:33,532
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

125
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,327
I got it.

126
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,923
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

127
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,730
It's Paul.

128
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:47,248
Oh, God. Is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

129
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,926
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

130
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:50,928
Maybe.

131
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:54,289
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

132
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,409
He finally asked you out?

133
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,091
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

134
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,005
Rach, I can cancel.

135
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,607
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

136
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:06,446
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

137
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,325
That'd be good.

138
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:15,287
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

139
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,925
Does he sell it, drink it,
or he just complains a lot?

140
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,562
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

141
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,847
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

142
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:32,161
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

143
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,804
I'll be right back.
I've just got to go a--

144
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,923
A-wandering?

145
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,127
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

146
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:50,328
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

147
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,042
Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip.

148
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:00,250
She likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot. . .

149
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:03,689
. . .over and over again, till
it starts to get a little red.

150
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,723
Shut up, Joey!

151
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,443
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

152
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:14,966
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

153
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:16,725
. . .so, nothing.

154
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,529
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

155
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:26,323
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

156
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,771
. . .big lizards.

157
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,611
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

158
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,730
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

159
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,321
And we're very excited about it.

160
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:45,005
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

161
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,521
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

162
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:48,687
Pheebs, wanna help?

163
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:51,207
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

164
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:05,725
Love is sweet as summer showers

165
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,651
Love is a wondrous work of art

166
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:13,807
But your love, oh, your love
Your love

167
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,729
Is like a giant pigeon

168
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,447
Crapping on my heart

169
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:26,331
Thank you!

170
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,971
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

171
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,522
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

172
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:47,529
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

173
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,650
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

174
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:54,961
We got a bookcase here.

175
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,123
It's a beautiful thing.

176
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,240
What's this?

177
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,882
I would have to say that is
an L-shaped bracket.

178
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:08,526
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

179
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,687
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

180
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,126
This was Carol's favorite beer.

181
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,524
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

182
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,567
If you start with that,
we're out of here.

183
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:32,605
Please don't spoil all this fun.

184
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,086
Let me ask you a question.

185
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:38,530
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

186
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:39,767
What did you get?

187
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:41,522
You guys.

188
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,563
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

189
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,328
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

190
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:52,764
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

191
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,082
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

192
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,522
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

193
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,165
How did you get through it?

194
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,768
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

195
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,286
-Say her--
-Leg?

196
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,483
That's one way of going through it.

197
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,491
Me, I went for the watch.

198
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:13,410
You actually broke her watch?
The worst thing I ever did was. . .

199
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:16,530
. . .I shredded my old boyfriend's
favorite bath towel.

200
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,411
-Steer clear of you!
-That's right.

201
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,970
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

202
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:28,127
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

203
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,926
It's about me.
And I just--

204
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,285
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

205
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:49,762
I know that some girl is going to be
lucky to become Mr. Barry Finkel.

206
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,163
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

207
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:58,327
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is
right now, but give me a chance to--

208
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,811
I'm divorced!

209
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,963
I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.

210
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,123
Shut up.

211
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,528
That only took me an hour.

212
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:20,322
Between us, we haven't had a
relationship last longer than a Mento.

213
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:26,489
You, however, have had the love
of a woman for four years.

214
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,929
Four years of closeness and sharing.

215
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,850
After which,
she ripped your heart out. . .

216
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,322
. . .and that is why we don't do it.

217
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,922
I don't think that was my point.

218
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,125
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

219
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:46,523
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

220
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:51,408
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

221
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,329
What are you talking about?
One woman.

222
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,368
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

223
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:04,321
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

224
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:08,611
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

225
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:13,683
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

226
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:16,326
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

227
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,245
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

228
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,921
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

229
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,561
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

230
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,929
Then stay out of my freezer.

231
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,643
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

232
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,769
What? What?

233
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,242
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

234
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:44,882
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

235
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:49,050
So there's going to be a fifth date?

236
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,248
Isn't there?

237
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,368
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

238
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,328
What were you going to say?

239
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,682
Ever since she left me. . .

240
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,962
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

241
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,531
. . .sexually.

242
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,611
Oh, God! Oh, God!

243
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:15,921
I'm so sorry.

244
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:19,528
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

245
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,608
How long?

246
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,168
Two years.

247
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,525
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

248
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,723
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

249
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,731
Yeah, I do.

250
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,923
We are gathered here
to join together...

251
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:46,642
...Joanie Louise Cunningham...

252
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:51,329
...and Charles Chachi,
Chachi, Chachi...

253
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:55,371
...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

254
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,921
-Marriage is the most sacred--
-See!

255
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:02,723
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

256
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,410
''Grab a spoon. ''

257
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,843
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

258
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:13,323
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

259
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:20,201
Great story. But I gotta go.

260
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,285
I got a date with Andrea.

261
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,524
Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

262
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:29,003
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

263
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:32,244
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

264
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,528
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

265
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,524
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

266
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,528
. . .who am I going to ask?

267
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,520
Isn't this amazing?

268
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,962
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

269
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,601
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

270
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:16,242
I figure if I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

271
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:21,124
I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do. ''

272
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:26,130
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

273
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:31,761
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

274
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,802
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

275
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,443
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

276
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,170
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

277
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,131
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

278
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,160
Thank you.

279
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,811
-Thank you so much.
-Stop!

280
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,371
Last night was like. . .

281
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:02,968
. . .all my birthdays, graduations, plus
the barn-raising scene in Witness.

282
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,326
We'll talk later.

283
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,531
Thank you.

284
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,722
That wasn't a real date.

285
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:29,326
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

286
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,128
Shut up and put my table back.

287
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:36,250
I've got to get to work.

288
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:41,327
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

289
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:47,127
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

290
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,964
Yeah, we all have jobs.

291
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,680
That's how we buy stuff.

292
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:56,126
Yeah, I'm an actor.

293
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,722
Have I seen you in anything?

294
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,167
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

295
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:05,041
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

296
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,322
. . .at the Little Theater in the Park.

297
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,211
It was a job, all right?

298
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,922
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

299
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,564
I will not take this abuse.

300
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,723
You're right. I'm sorry.

301
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,924
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

302
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,880
You should both know that
he's a dead man.

303
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,330
Oh, Chandler!

304
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:34,207
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

305
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:37,922
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

306
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:41,722
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

307
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:50,050
I know. He's just so--

308
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,089
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

309
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,331
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

310
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,681
-Are you in trouble!
-Big time!

311
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,242
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

312
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,325
We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

313
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:12,922
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

314
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:16,131
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

315
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,010
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

316
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:21,403
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

317
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,567
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

318
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,245
How was Florida?

319
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,722
You had sex, didn't you?

320
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,608
How do you do that?

321
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:43,525
I hate you. I'm pushing my
aunt through Parrot Jungle. . .

322
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:45,205
. . .and you're having sex.

323
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,924
So, who?

324
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,931
You know Paul?

325
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,929
Paul, the wine guy?

326
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,360
Yeah, I know Paul.

327
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,247
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

328
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,687
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

329
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:05,726
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

330
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:11,327
Of course it was a line.

331
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:14,286
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

332
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,524
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

333
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,529
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

334
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:22,962
I hate men. I hate men!

335
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,806
Don't hate. Don't put that out
in the universe.

336
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,765
Is it me?

337
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:32,527
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

338
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,161
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

339
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:37,209
Come here.
Give me your feet.

340
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:46,642
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

341
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,923
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

342
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:58,448
Guess what?

343
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:00,529
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

344
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,404
I'm trained for nothing.

345
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:06,083
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

346
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:07,765
You're surprisingly upbeat.

347
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,322
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

348
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,210
. . .50% percent off.

349
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,170
How well you know me.

350
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,761
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

351
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,003
I've got great boots,'' boots.

352
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,443
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

353
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:27,604
And who pays for that?

354
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,203
My father.

355
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,523
Come on, is this necessary?

356
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,563
I can stop charging any time I want.

357
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:39,768
You can't live off your parents.

358
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:43,561
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

359
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,282
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

360
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:49,125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

361
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:51,971
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

362
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,970
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

363
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,123
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

364
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:01,763
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

365
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:03,604
And then he killed himself.

366
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:08,209
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

367
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,927
The word you're looking for is:

368
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:15,761
''Anyway. . . . ''

369
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:21,966
You ready?

370
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,407
No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?

371
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:27,246
''You ready to jump out of
the plane without a chute?''

372
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:28,481
I can't do this.

373
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,723
-I know you can.
-I don't think so.

374
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:33,532
You made coffee.
You can do anything.

375
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:38,009
Cut, cut, cut.

376
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:44,530
You know what?

377
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:48,401
We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.

378
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:50,449
That was a library card.

379
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:01,528
If you listen very closely, you can
hear a thousand retailers scream.

380
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,170
Welcome to the real world!

381
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:08,926
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

382
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,923
That's it.

383
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,525
You gonna crash on the couch?

384
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:24,526
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

385
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,810
Look what I just
found on the floor.

386
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:30,961
What?

387
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,250
That's Paul's watch.

388
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,926
You can just put it back
where you found it.

389
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:38,928
Oh, boy! All right.

390
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:41,722
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

391
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,168
-I'm sorry.
-No!

392
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:55,926
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

393
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:04,720
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

394
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:06,968
. . .a major crush on you.

395
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,527
I knew.

396
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,331
You did?

397
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:16,402
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

398
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,931
I did.

399
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:24,564
Listen, do you think--

400
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:28,930
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

401
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,920
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

402
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:38,440
Maybe.

403
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,723
Okay, maybe I will.

404
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,729
-Good night.
-Good night.

405
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:08,931
See you.

406
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,042
Wait, wait.

407
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,361
What's with you?

408
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:18,128
I just grabbed a spoon.

409
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,205
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

410
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,010
I can 't believe
What I'm hearing

411
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:32,322
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

412
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,048
Would you stop?

413
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:36,524
Was I doing it again?

414
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:42,644
I said that you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

415
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,606
You wouldn't know a great
butt if it bit you.

416
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,331
There's an image.

417
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,523
Would anybody like more coffee?

418
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,044
Did you make it?

419
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,531
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

420
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,686
Kids, new dream.

421
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,047
I'm in Las Vegas.

422
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,486
Miss, more coffee?

423
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:08,329
Excuse me? Could you give this
to that guy over there?

424
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:10,651
Go ahead.

425
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,007
Thank you.

426
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:14,328
Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

427
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,290
So I'm in Las Vegas.

428
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:19,530
I'm Liza Minnelli.

00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,299
You guys don't understand.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,338
For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,973
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,649
You serious?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,610
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,095
All you need to know
is in the first kiss.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,136
Absolutely.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,774
For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,972
. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,091
. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,332
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,735
It's just that that's not. . .

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,851
. . .why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,298
The problem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,896
. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,098
We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,779
. . .just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,493
Well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,177
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,089
Are we still talking about sex?

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,492

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,811
No, it's good.
It is good.

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,535
It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,332
Well, she has issues.

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,299
Does she?

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,890
He's out banging other women
with a club. . .

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,615
. . .while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

29
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,772
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,896
Okay, they have issues like:

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,736
''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?

32
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,500
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,893
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,732
Okay. Yes, it is.

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,175
I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,893
Hi.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,856
So. . . .

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,699
You look great.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,935
I hate that.

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,730
Sorry.

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,050
Thanks. You look good too.

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,689
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

43
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,774
. . .stands erect. . . .

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,413
So what's new?
Still a--

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,769
A lesbian?

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,689
You never know.

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,171
How's the family?

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,379
Marty's still totally paranoid.

49
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,298
Carol, why are you here?

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,976
I'm pregnant.

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,295
Pregnant!

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,329
She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,091
This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,891
Then I've already seen this one.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,292
Are you through with that?

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,048
Sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,218
Whose ball of paper is this?

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,055
That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.

59
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,296
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,456
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed-- It's fine.

61
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,416
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,611
We know how cruel parents can be. . .

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,579
. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,372
Monica? Hi!

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,369
Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,931
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,455
Not in a good way.

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,335
Yeah, calm down.

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,892
You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,695
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

71
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,737
You see, he's ''The Prince. ''

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,290
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,248
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,819
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful!

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,613
Oh, God! Oh, God!

76
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,091
No, don't touch that.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,533
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

78
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,691
''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .

79
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,698
. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,932
Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

81
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,978
. . .which makes it so much harder.

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,777
Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,610
Okay, look.

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,613
When did you have it last?

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.

86
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,900
You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,020
I know I had it this morning.

88
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,138
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

89
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,699
Dinah?

90
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,099
Oh, don't be mad.

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,695
-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,090
I gave you one job!

93
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,894
But look how straight
those noodles are.

94
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,099
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

95
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,859
I just can't do it.

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,089
Boys?

97
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,499
We're going in!

98
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,576
Hi.

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,098
That is not a happy ''hi. ''

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,733
Carol's pregnant.

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,293
I found it!

102
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,094
Yeah.

103
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,692
Do that for two hours. . .

104
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,494
. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

105
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,532
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

106
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,135
How do you fit
into this whole thing?

107
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,894
Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

108
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,537
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

109
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,657
Basically, it's totally up to me.

110
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,930
She is so great.
I miss her.

111
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,333
What does she mean by ''involved''?

112
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,974
Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.

113
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,608
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

114
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,175
. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

115
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,369
What'll you do?

116
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,536
I have no idea.

117
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,295
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

118
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,458
This is still ruined, right?

119
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,891
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.

120
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,298
What's that curry taste?

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,895
Curry.

122
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,138
I think they're great.
I really do.

123
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,292
Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,138
They all had a thing for him!

125
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,890
Oh, Mom!

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,210
Why is this girl going to call me?

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,692
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,089
. . .or I don't know.

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,938
I told her you had a restaurant.

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,252
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,218
They don't have to know that.

132
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,370
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,736
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

134
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,299
. . .easy.

135
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,298
This'll sound unbelievably selfish
on my part. . .

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,492
. . .but did you plan on bringing
up the baby/lesbian thing?

137
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,452
It'd take the heat off of me.

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,089
What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.

139
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,131
They were not playing very well.

140
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,496
I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

141
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,129
. . .but $40,000 is a lot of money.

142
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,495
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

143
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,734
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,089
Nothing.

145
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,538
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

146
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,977
Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.

147
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,490
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,692
. . .and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

149
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,132
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles. . . .

150
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,328
There are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

151
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,259
With his museum and
his papers getting published.

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,496
Others are satisfied as they are.

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,295
I'm telling you, these are
the people who never get cancer.

154
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,099
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God. . .

155
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,173
. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.

156
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,374
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,976
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

158
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,570
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering. . .

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,738
. . .what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

160
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,578
So here's the deal.

161
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,979
Carol's a lesbian.

162
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,335
She's living with a woman named Susan.

163
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,694
She's pregnant with my child.

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,538
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

165
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,013
And you knew about this?

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,212
Your folks are really that bad?

167
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,734
Well, you know, these people are pros.

168
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,329
They know what they do.
They take their time.

169
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,140
They get the job done!

170
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,932
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

171
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,092
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

172
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,776
Must pee!

173
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,252
It's worse when you're twins.

174
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,496
-You're a twin?
-Yeah. We don't speak.

175
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,419
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

176
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,492
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

177
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,493
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

178
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,493
Chandler, you're an only child.
You don't have any of this.

179
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,937
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend. . .

180
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,852
. . .who my parents preferred.

181
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,096
Hit the lights, please.

182
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,013
How long was I in there?

183
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,855
I'm just cleaning up.

184
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,094
Do you need any help?

185
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,059
Okay, sure. Thanks.

186
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,689
Anyway. . . .

187
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,777
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

188
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,619
A little.

189
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,699
A lot.

190
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,289
So, got any advice?

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,492
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

192
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,010
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word ''dumped. ''

193
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,419
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

194
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,494
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,012
You know, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

196
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,697
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-G YN.

197
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,935
You've got Carol tomorrow.

198
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,617
When did it get so complicated?

199
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,054
Got me.

200
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,289
Remember when we were
in high school together?

201
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,895
Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

202
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,449
. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?

203
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,255
Man! I never thought I'd be here.

204
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,935
Me neither.

205
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,931
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

206
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,616
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway. . . .

207
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,376
Hi.

208
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,658
-You remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

209
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,528
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

210
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,174
So we're just waiting for. . .?

211
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,610
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

212
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,697
-She.
-Of course, ''she. ''

213
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,259
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

214
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,212
Yes, and she's very supportive.

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,376
Great! Okay, that's great!

216
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,089
No, I'm. . . .

217
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,290
Thanks.

218
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,658
That opens my cervix.

219
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,656
Barry?

220
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,088
Come on in.

221
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,770
Are you sure?

222
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,053
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

223
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,338
So how are you doing?

224
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,290
I'm. . . .

225
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,099
I'm okay.

226
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,415
You look great.

227
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,929
Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

228
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,899
Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

229
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,576
I dumped him.

230
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,933
So how's this going to work. . .

231
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,939
. . .you know, with us?

232
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,978
You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

233
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,614
Give me a ''for instance. ''

234
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,492
Well, I don't know.

235
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,010
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .

236
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,688
. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.

237
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,099
As in ''Mouse''?

238
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,059
As in my grandmother.

239
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,812
Still, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse. ''

240
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,378
How about. . . .

241
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,333
How about ''Julia''?

242
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,169
Julia.

243
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,495
We agreed on Minnie.

244
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,340
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

245
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,094
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

246
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,611
I believe Julia's on the table.

247
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,899
Sorry about that.

248
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,335
So what have you been up to?

249
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,934
Not much.

250
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,529
I got a job.

251
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,889
That's great!

252
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,533
Why are you so tan?

253
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,169
I went to Aruba.

254
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,099
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?

255
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,489
No.

256
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,498
See, I went with. . . .

257
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,538
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

258
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,649
I went with Mindy.

259
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,495
Mindy?

260
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,808
My maid of honor?

261
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,692
We're kind of a thing now.

262
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,972
You got plugs!

263
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,979
Careful, careful. They
haven't quite taken yet.

264
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,138
And you got lenses.

265
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,699
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

266
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,293
Not for her.

267
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,410
Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.

268
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,211
A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

269
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,889
. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

270
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,414
And I'm an orthodontist.

271
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,213
You know, you were right.

272
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,098
I thought we were happy.

273
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,455
We weren't.

274
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,937
But with Mindy. . .

275
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,298
. . .now I'm happy.

276
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,729
-Spit.
-What?

277
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,816
Me.

278
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,699
Anyway. . . .

279
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,737
I guess this belongs to you.

280
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,095
And thank you for giving it to me.

281
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,135
Well, thank you for giving it back.

282
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,893
Hello!

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,331
Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?

284
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,575
Helen Geller?

285
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,969
l don't think so!

286
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,211
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

287
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,489
Thank you.

288
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,571
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

289
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,779
It'll be Helen Willick?

290
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,933
Actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

291
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,140
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

292
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,659
It's my baby too.

293
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,974
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

294
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,094
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

295
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,213
You two, stop it!

296
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,496
She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

297
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,210
Not Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.

298
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,049
Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

299
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,178
He knows no one will
say all those names.

300
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,736
They'll end up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

301
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,291
My way?
You think this is my way?

302
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,010
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .

303
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,730
. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

304
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,540
Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

305
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,571
-A little.
-Just a little.

306
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,890
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

307
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,936
Lie back.

308
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,418
You know what? I'm gonna go.

309
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,494
I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

310
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,454
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,888
Look at that!

312
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,453
I know!

313
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,691
Well, isn't that amazing?

314
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,898
What are we supposed to see?

315
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,289
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

316
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,093
If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes. . .

317
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,495
. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.

318
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,292
Then don't do that, all right?

319
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,733
What do you think?

320
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,779
Are you welling up?

321
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,376
You are.

322
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,690
-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.

323
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,579
-You're going to be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up!

324
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,498
Hi, Mindy!

325
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,497
Hi, it's Rachel.

326
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,489
Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.

327
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,214
He told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

328
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,816
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

329
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,530
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out. . .

330
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,289
. . .and you guys end up getting
married and having kids. . .

331
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,458
. . .I hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose!

332
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,975
I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!

00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:07,307
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,743
How did it go?

3
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:09,819
Not so good.

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,226
He walked me home and said,
''We should do this again. ''

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,782
He said, ''We should do it again. ''
That's good, right?

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,862
Loosely translated,
''We should do this again,'' means:

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,065
''You will never see me naked. ''

8
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,457
Since when?

9
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,826
Since always.
It's, like, ''dating'' language.

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,027
Like, ''It's not you,''
means, ''It is you. ''

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,144
''You're nice,'' means, ''I'll be
dating leather-clad alcoholics. . .

12
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,624
. . .and complaining
about them to you. ''

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,663
''I think we should see
other people,'' means:

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,308
''Ha, ha, I already am! ''

15
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,062
Everybody knows this?

16
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,138
Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,619
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep. . .

18
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,939
. . .and saying it went to
live on a farm.

19
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,460
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did. . .

20
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,621
. . .send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:01,822
Ross. . .?

22
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,869
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

23
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,339
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

24
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,978
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

25
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,582
And it was. . . .

26
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,818
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

27
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:22,025

''How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?''

30
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,106
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

31
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,945
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

32
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,747
That was really good!

33
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,021
Thanks. Let's keep going.

34
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:34,063
''So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?''

35
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,263
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

36
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,385
''Smoke away! ''

37
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,299
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

38
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,140
-What?
-Relax your hand.

39
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,061
Let your wrist go.

40
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,219
Not so much.

41
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,425
All right. Now try taking a puff.

42
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,422
Right.

43
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:12,945
Give it to me.

44
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,384
I'm not giving you a cigarette.

45
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,826
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not?

46
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,427
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

47
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,423
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

48
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,424
When you're holding it, you feel right.

49
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,818
You feel complete.

50
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:31,945
You miss it?

51
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,622
No, not so much.

52
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,425
All right. Now we smoke.

53
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,418
Oh, my God!

54
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,545
It's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb. . .

55
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,019
. . .to the tip of his index finger.

56
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,261
That's ridiculous.

57
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,108
Can I use either thumb?

58
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,020
All right. Don't tell me.

59
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,021
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

60
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,421
Coffee, black.

61
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,578
Latte.

62
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,778
And an iced tea.

63
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,348
I'm getting good at this.

64
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,385
Excellent!

65
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,777
Good for me!

66
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:42,905
You okay, Phoebe?

67
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,628
It's not even worth--

68
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,222
It's my bank.

69
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,618
What did they do?

70
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,463
I'm going through my mail, and I
open up their monthly ''statement. ''

71
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,824
Easy!

72
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,469
And there's $500 extra in my account.

73
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,623
Satan's minions at work again!

74
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,738
Now I have to go down there
and deal with them--

75
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,707
What are you talking about?
Keep it!

76
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,018
It's not mine.

77
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,743
If I kept it, it would be
like stealing.

78
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:14,345
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

79
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,820
Say I bought
a great pair of shoes.

80
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,145
Know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

81
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,857
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. ''

82
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,669
And even if I was happy
and skipping. . .

83
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,901
. . .I'd hear, ''Not-not mine.
Not-not mine. ''

84
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,707
We're with you. We got it.

85
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:36,782
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

86
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,627
Chandler, what are you doing?

87
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,021
What are you doing?

88
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,020
Oh, gross!

89
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,579
What is this?

90
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,023
I'm smoking! I'm smoking!

91
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,624
You've been so good for three years!

92
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,224
And this is my reward.

93
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,826
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

94
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,866
So this time I won't quit.

95
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,387
All right! I'm putting it out!

96
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,022
Oh, no!

97
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,225
I can't drink this now.

98
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,145
I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

99
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,698
Is this Alan again?
How's it going?

100
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,862
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

101
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,861
When do we get to meet the guy?

102
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,821
Let's see, today's Monday. . . .

103
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,422
Never!

104
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,820
Not after what happened with Steve.

105
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,984
What do you mean?

106
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,380
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

107
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,139
Sorry.

108
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,381
I don't know how I feel about him.
Let me figure it out.

109
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,658
Then can we meet him?

110
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,222
Sorry.

111
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,148
Why should they meet him?

112
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,142
I bring a guy home and they're
all over him like. . .

113
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,026
. . .coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

114
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,861
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef. . .

115
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:05,658
. . .I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

116
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,264
Your friends are just
looking out after you.

117
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,660
I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

118
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,345
You realize the odds of that
happening are a little slimmer. . .

119
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,819
. . .if they never get to meet the guy.

120
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,218
Let it go, Ross.

121
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,627
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

122
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,658
Do you all promise?

123
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,469
Yeah, we promise.
We'll be good.

124
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,422
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

125
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,868
You can come in, but your filter
tip little buddy stays outside!

126
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,378
''Dear Ms. Buffay:

127
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,142
Thank you for calling.

128
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,428
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience. . .

129
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,427
. . .and hope you'll accept
this football phone. . .

130
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:09,420
. . .as our gift. ''
Do you believe it?

131
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,741
Now I have $ 1 000
and a football phone.

132
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,624
What bank is this?

133
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,420
Okay, it's him.

134
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,144
-Who is it?
-Alan.

135
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,981
Chandler! He's here!

136
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,820
Please be good. Please?

137
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,023
Just remember how much
you all like me.

138
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,863
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

139
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,422
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

140
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,021
I'll call you tomorrow.

141
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,620
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

142
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,661
Who's gonna take the first shot?

143
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,663
Come on!

144
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,828
I'll go.

145
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,858
Let's start with the way he
kept picking at--

146
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:14,428
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

147
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,022
Can't do it. We loved him.

148
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,463
We loved him!

149
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:18,744
Wait a minute!

150
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,423
We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

151
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,701
And did you notice?

152
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,542
Know what was great?
The way his smile was crooked.

153
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,586
Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

154
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,498
What shoe?

155
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,143
From the nursery rhyme.

156
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,459
''There was a crooked man
with a crooked smile. . .

157
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,269
. . .who lived in a shoe for a while. . . . ''

158
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,020
So I think Alan. . .

159
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:52,582
. . .is the yardstick against which all
future boyfriends will be measured.

160
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:53,944
What future boyfriends?

161
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,226
-I think this could be, you know, ''it. ''
-Really?

162
00:09:57,469 --> 00:10:01,223
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

163
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,818
You know I'll be doing that
at parties, right?

164
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,023
-Know what I like most about him?
-What?

165
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,826
The way he makes me feel about myself.

166
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:35,984
How was the game?

167
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,628
Well. . . .

168
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,627
We won!

169
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,902
Fantastic! One question:
How is that possible?

170
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,059
-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

171
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,659
He was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs plays every position.

172
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,219
But instead of Bugs, it was 1 st
base, Alan. 2nd base, Alan. . . .

173
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,065
It was like he made us into a team.

174
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,621
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

175
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:09,701
Can I ask you guys a question?

176
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,264
Do you think Alan
is maybe sometimes--

177
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,419
What?

178
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,137
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

179
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,699
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too ''Alan. ''

180
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,942
It's his innate ''Alan-ness''
that we adore.

181
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,825
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

182
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:33,624
Hey, Lizzy.

183
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,148
Hey, Weird Girl.

184
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:38,227
-I bought alphabet soup.
-Did you pick out the vowels?

185
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,227
I left in the Y's.
Because ''--sometimes Y. ''

186
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,578
And something else.

187
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,784
Saltines?

188
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,224
Would you like $ 1 000
and a football phone?

189
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,017
What?

190
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,702
Oh, my God!

191
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,543
-There's really money in here.
-I know.

192
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:56,342
What are you doing?

193
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,228
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

194
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,421
I have to give you something.

195
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,182
No, it's fine. You don't--

196
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,260
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

197
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,182
No, you need that.
It's okay. Thanks.

198
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,624
Please. Let me do something.

199
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,942
I'll tell you what. You buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

200
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,227
Keep the change.

201
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,659
Thanks, Lizzy.

202
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,058
Want a pretzel?

203
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,221
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

204
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,505
A thumb?

205
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,179
I know. I opened it
and there it was. . .

206
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,580
. . .floating in there, like
this tiny little hitchhiker.

207
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,943
Maybe it's a contest?
Like ''Collect all five. ''

208
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,583
Does anyone wanna see?

209
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,103
No, thanks!

210
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,468
Don't do that. Come on!

211
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,062
It's worse than the thumb.

212
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,543
This is so unfair.

213
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,108
Why is it unfair?

214
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,943
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

215
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,703
Joey's constant knuckle-
cracking isn't annoying?

216
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,985
And Ross, over-pronouncing
every word.

217
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,424
And Monica, who snorts
when she laughs.

218
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,819
I mean, what the hell
is that thing?

219
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:17,620
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

220
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,626
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

221
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,061
I could live without it.

222
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:40,220
Is it like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

223
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:46,061
Don't listen to him, Pheebs.
I think it's endearing.

224
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:48,425
Oh, you do, do you?

225
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,381
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

226
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,223
lndeed there isn't.

227
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,987
I should get back to work.

228
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:07,426
Otherwise someone might
get what they actually ordered.

229
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,582
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

230
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,819
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

231
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,218
No.

232
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,617
Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

233
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,418
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

234
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,820
All right! A cow got through.

235
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,188
Can you believe it?

236
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,987
It's just, you know what?

237
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,862
I just don't feel the ''thing. ''

238
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,537
They feel the thing.
I don't feel the thing.

239
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,508
Honey, you should always. . .

240
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,347
. . .feel the thing.

241
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,866
If that's how you feel about
the guy, dump him.

242
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,667
It's gonna be really hard.

243
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,661
He's a big boy.
He'll get over it.

244
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:13,221
No, he'll be fine. It's the other
five I'm worried about.

245
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,581
Don't you respect your body?

246
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,467
Don't you see what you're doing?

247
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,025
I've had it with you
and your cancer. . .

248
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,026
. . .emphysema and heart disease.

249
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,619
The bottom line is smoking is cool,
and you know it.

250
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,261
Alan wants to speak to you.

251
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,227
Really? He does?

252
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,626
Hey, buddy! What's up?

253
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,459
She told you about that, huh?

254
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,018
Well, yeah. I have one now
and then. Well, yeah, now.

255
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,622
It's not that bad--

256
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,620
Well, that's true.

257
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,828
Gee, no one's ever put it
like that before.

258
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,020
Well, okay. Thanks.

259
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:10,978
God, he's good.

260
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,068
If only he were a woman.

261
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,462
Oh, Lamb Chop!

262
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,223
How old is that sock?

263
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,818
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

264
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:35,826
I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

265
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:40,425
Where's Joey?

266
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,547
Joey ate my last stick
of gum, so I killed him.

267
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,025
Do you think that was wrong?

268
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:49,908
I think he's across the hall.

269
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,222
There you go.

270
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,139
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

271
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,623
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop Tart?

272
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,223
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop Tart?

273
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,422
Hey, I might.

274
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,822
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,665
Those stupid soda people gave
me $ 7000 for the thumb.

276
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,098
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

277
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,745
What is up with the universe?

278
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:22,899
What's going on?

279
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,663
Nothing. I think it's nice
when we're together.

280
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,026
It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

281
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,101
Please, guys, we have to talk.

282
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,105
Wait, wait!

283
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,021
I'm getting a d�j� vu.

284
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,418
No, I'm not.

285
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,098
We have to talk.

286
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,225
There it is!

287
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,260
It's about Alan.

288
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,020
There's something you should know.

289
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,626
There's really no
easy way to say this.

290
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,698
I've decided to break up with Alan.

291
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,827
Is there somebody else?

292
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,218
It's just. . .

293
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,262
. . .you know, things change.
People change.

294
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,625
We didn't change.

295
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,706
So that's it? It's over?

296
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,623
Just like that?

297
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:35,419
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and I just--

298
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,668
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

299
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,588
That wouldn't be fair to me,
to Alan, or to you.

300
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,020
Well, who wants fair?

301
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,824
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

302
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:54,505
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,627
Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.

304
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:00,662
I just can't believe this!

305
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:05,221
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

306
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,422
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

307
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:10,704
Yeah, right!

308
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,027
Are you guys gonna be okay?

309
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,821
We'll be fine.

310
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:21,463
We're just gonna need a little time.

311
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,027
I understand.

312
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,339
I'm really sorry.

313
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,228
I mean, I'm sorry too.

314
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:36,820
But I'm a little relieved.

315
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,899
Relieved?

316
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,420
Well, l mean, l had
a great time with you.

317
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,418
I just can't stand your friends.

318
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,419
Remember when we went to
Central Park and rented boats?

319
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,828
That was fun.

320
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,825
He could row like a Viking.

321
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,145
So how'd it go?

322
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,825
You know.

323
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,821
Did he mention us?

324
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,623
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

325
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,058
Rough day, huh?

326
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,628
You have no idea.

327
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,228
Come here.

328
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,420
That's it.
I'm getting cigarettes.

329
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,065
I don't care!

330
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,267
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

331
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,461
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $ 7000.

332
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,622
Yeah, all right.

00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:05,045
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:09,610
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace. . .

3
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:12,770
. . .no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

4
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,006
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,841
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,048
What about you?

7
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:25,040
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,411
There's always one guy. . . .

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,644
''If I had a wish, I'd wish
for three more wishes. ''

10
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:34,086
Hey, Joey.

11
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,363
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

12
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:38,844
Probably kill myself.

13
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,527
Excuse me?

14
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:45,162
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

15
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,402
Joey, omnipotent.

16
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,650
You are?

17
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:54,684
Ross, I'm--

18
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,008
The One With George Stephanopoulos

English Subtitles by

20
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,450
How does she do that?

21
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:50,241
I cannot sleep in a public place.

22
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,240
Would you look at her?

23
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,369
She's so peaceful.

24
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,246
What?

25
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:02,290
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

26
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,567
What's going on?

27
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,131
I got no sleep last night.

28
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,051
My grandmother has
this new boyfriend. . .

29
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:12,249
. . .and they're both
kind of insecure in bed, so--

30
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,931
And deaf.

31
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:19,446
They're constantly reassuring
each other they're having a good time.

32
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,643
You have no idea how loud they are.

33
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,250
You can stay with Rachel and me.

34
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,641
Thanks.

35
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,604
--95, 96, 97.

36
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:32,840
See, I told you. Less than
1 00 steps from our place to here.

37
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:35,845
You got way too much free time, man.

38
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,647
There's the birthday boy.

39
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:39,928
Check it out.

40
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,448
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

41
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,602
Happy birthday!

42
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,251
We love you, man.

43
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:50,452
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

44
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,442
-So?
-I'm guessing you had an extra ticket. . .

45
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,047
. . .and couldn't decide
who got to bring a date?

46
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:00,051
Well, aren't we
Mr. ''The Glass is Half Empty. ''

47
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,445
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,683
Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

49
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,048
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

50
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,851
What's wrong with the 20th?

51
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,243
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

52
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:16,450
Today's the day Carol and I. . .

53
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:19,043
. . .first consummated. . .

54
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:21,443
. . .our physical relationship.

55
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,245
Sex.

56
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,491
I better pass on the game.

57
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

58
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:37,046
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

59
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,207
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

60
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,609
Guys night out! Come on,
what do you say, big guy? Huh?

61
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,442
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

62
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,087
Come on, Ross.

63
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,971
All right. Maybe it will
take my mind off it.

64
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,409
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

65
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:56,568
Look, look!

66
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,251
My first paycheck!

67
00:03:58,452 --> 00:03:59,646
Look at the window!

68
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,452
There's my name! Hi, me!

69
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,003
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

70
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,529
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

71
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:12,851
You worked in a mine?

72
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,641
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen.
Why?

73
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,492
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.

74
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,286
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.

75
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,045
And it was totally. . .

76
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:28,250
. . .not worth it.

77
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,571
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

78
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,648
I mean, what--?
Chandler, look at that.

79
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:39,084
This is not that bad.

80
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,368
You're fine for a first job.

81
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,852
You can totally, totally
live on this.

82
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:50,167
By the way, great service today.

83
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,606
-Terrific!
-Excellent!

84
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,285
Hockey!

85
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:08,851
Hockey!

86
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:12,168
Rachel?

87
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:15,327
Oh, my God!

88
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,044
I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

89
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,004
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,483
We were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here. . .

91
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:32,643
. . .and it's true!

92
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,809
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

93
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:44,042
God, look at you! You are so big!
I can't believe it!

94
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,647
I know, I know!
I'm a duplex.

95
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,810
So what's going on with you?

96
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:53,163
Guess who my dad's making
partner in his firm?

97
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,646
And while we're on
the subject of news. . . .

98
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:04,247
Look! I have elbows!

99
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,570
Passes it up to Leetch.

100
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,645
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass!

101
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:19,767
We'll take a time-out while Messier
looks at some women's shoes.

102
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:23,330
Carol was wearing boots
just like those the night. . .

103
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,051
. . .that we first. . . .

104
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:26,851
You know?

105
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,491
In fact, she. . .

106
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,643
. . .she never took them off.

107
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,241
It's because we--
Sorry.

108
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:39,368
What?

109
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,728
Peach pit.

110
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,162
Yes, bunny?

111
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,687
Peach pit.

112
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,605
-That night, we had--
-Peaches?

113
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:50,207
Actually, nectarines,
but basically. . . .

114
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,681
Could've been a peach.

115
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,163
Then we got dressed. . .

116
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,289
. . .and I walked her to. . .

117
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:00,443
. . .the bus stop.

118
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,168
I'm fine.

119
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,202
That woman's got
an ass like Carol's.

120
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,446
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

121
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,160
Come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

122
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:20,084
The biggest news is still you
dumping Barry at the altar.

123
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:25,727
All right, let's talk
reality for a second.

124
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,082
-When are you coming home?
-What?

125
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,884
Guys, I'm not.

126
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,282
Come on. This is us.

127
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,885
I'm not.

128
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,442
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

129
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:38,568
Waitressing?

130
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,246
I'm not just waitressing.

131
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,851
I mean, I'm. . . .

132
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:50,163
I write the specials
on the specials board.

133
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:54,485
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

134
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:59,285
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

135
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,251
Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

136
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:14,890
How was it with your friends?

137
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:22,289
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki-Death punch?

138
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,681
What's that?

139
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:26,048
-Well, it's rum and--
-Okay.

140
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:32,008
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

141
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,446
We got trashy magazines.

142
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,842
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.

143
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,451
And I brought Operation.

144
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,042
But I lost the tweezers
so we can't operate.

145
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,043
But we can prep the guy.

146
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,362
Rach, it's the VISA-card people.

147
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,648
Oh, God.
Ask them what they want.

148
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,850
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

149
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:56,808
Yes, hold on.

150
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,526
There's been unusual
activity on your account.

151
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,967
But I haven't used my card in weeks.

152
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,850
That is the unusual activity.

153
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,843
They just wanna see if you're okay.

154
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,884
They wanna know if I'm okay?

155
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,692
They wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

156
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,850
Let's see. The FICA guys took
all my money.

157
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,845
Everyone I know is either
getting married or pregnant. . .

158
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,247
. . .or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.

159
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,483
And it's not even for me!

160
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:27,168
If that sounds like I'm okay,
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

161
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,482
Rachel has left the building.

162
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,008
Can you call back?

163
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:37,288
All right! Come on!

164
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:40,248
Let's play Twister!

165
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,648
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

166
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,846
There was ice there
that night with Carol?

167
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:59,647
Plastic seats? Four thousand
angry Pittsburgh fans?

168
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,083
I was just saying it looks
like we're not sitting together.

169
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:07,642
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

170
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:11,046
It was the first frost.

171
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:13,809
Just sit down. Sit.

172
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:17,488
You should feel great. You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

173
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,643
Monica, what is so amazing?

174
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:24,090
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?

175
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,811
You are just like Jack.

176
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:27,680
Jack from downstairs?

177
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,647
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

178
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:33,170
Ah, the other Jack.

179
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,565
See, he gave up something. . .

180
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,649
. . .but he got those magic beans.

181
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,371
Then he woke up and there was. . .

182
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:41,842
. . .this big plant. . .

183
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:45,283
. . .outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

184
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,047
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

185
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,848
Okay, but Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.

186
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,083
I gave up an orthodontist.

187
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,607
Okay, I know I didn't love him. . . .

188
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,047
See, Jack did love the cow.

189
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:03,651
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.

190
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:06,929
Everything was figured out
and now everything's like. . . .

191
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,451
''Flupie''?

192
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:13,165
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

193
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,880
At some point, it's all
gonna come together. . .

194
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,771
. . .and it's just gonna be ''un-flupie. ''

195
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,525
Yeah, like that's a word.

196
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:26,929
Okay, but, Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

197
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,808
Well, because you just--
I don't like this question.

198
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:39,288
See, you guys? What if we
don't get magic beans?

199
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,642
I mean, what if all we've got are. . .

200
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,844
. . .beans.

201
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:48,561
Get him!

202
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,245
Get him! Get him!

203
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,850
Yes! You're not laughing now,
are you, pal?

204
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:57,402
All you need are toothless guys
hitting each other with sticks.

205
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,842
Pass it! Pass it!

206
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,081
He's open!

207
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,811
Shoot it!

208
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,845
We're on that TV thing.

209
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,451
Excuse me?

210
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:32,050
It says to call if you're not completely
satisfied with this candy bar.

211
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,645
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

212
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,971
It's kind of an emergency.

213
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,521
You know that, or we'd be
in the predicament room.

214
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,567
Hold on.

215
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,564
Fill these out. Sit over there!

216
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,643
I don't wanna make any trouble.

217
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:56,124
But I'm in a lot of pain here,
all right? My face is dented.

218
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,010
You'll have to wait your turn.

219
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,446
How long will it be?

220
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,843
Any minute now.

221
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:22,764
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

222
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,843
No, you were right.

223
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,443
I don't have a plan.

224
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:31,247
Pizza guy!

225
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,050
-Thank God.
-Food!

226
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,368
-Phoebe?
-What?

227
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,250
Do you have a plan?

228
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,244
I don't even have a ''pla. ''

229
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,282
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

230
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,290
That's not what we ordered!

231
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,047
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

232
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,441
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopolous?

233
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,324
Oh, man.
My dad's gonna kill me!

234
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,482
Wait!

235
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,085
Did you say. . .

236
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,890
. . .G. Stephanopolous?

237
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,692
It goes across the street.
I gave him yours.

238
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,888
Bonehead! Bonehead!

239
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:14,288
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

240
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,485
That sounds about right.

241
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,087
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

242
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,606
And a power tie?

243
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,084
No, pretty much just a towel.

244
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:24,845
Oh, God!

245
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,207
Want me to take this back?

246
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,127
Are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopolous' pizza!

247
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,691
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

248
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,611
That's Big Bird's friend.

249
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:46,682
I see pizza!

250
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,888
I wanna see. Let me see.

251
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,009
Hello! Who are we spying on?

252
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:54,244
You know, the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy.

253
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:57,689
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt.

254
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:01,447
Oh, him! The little guy.
Oh, I love him!

255
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,887
Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

256
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:07,043
Tell me it's his mother.

257
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,852
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!

258
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,963
She's walking across the floor.

259
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,772
She's walking, she's walking.

260
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:18,448
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

261
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:33,448
Excuse me?

262
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,401
We've been here for over an hour,
and people less sick have gone in.

263
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:40,684
That guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

264
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,412
Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.

265
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,046
I know we both said some things. . .

266
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,686
. . .we didn't mean. . .

267
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,651
. . .but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

268
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,966
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

269
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,245
Lights still out?

270
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,044
Maybe they're napping.

271
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,483
Please. They're having sex.

272
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,085
Shut up!

273
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:18,290
So what do you think George is like?

274
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,045
I think he's shy.

275
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,448
I think you have to draw him out.

276
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:25,131
And then when you do. . .

277
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,442
. . .he's a preppy animal.

278
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,088
I remember the moonlight came in. . .

279
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:37,165
. . .through the open window,
and her face had the most. . .

280
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,686
. . .incredible glow.

281
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,083
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

282
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,847
You did this part. Could I get
some painkillers over here, please?

283
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:50,407
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

284
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,364
So you slept with her
for the first time.

285
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,684
So what? You slept with her
for seven years after that.

286
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,282
It's a little more complicated
than that.

287
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:04,162
Is it that she left you? That she
left you for a woman that likes women?

288
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:08,564
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

289
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,127
Then what?

290
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,248
My first time with Carol was. . .

291
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,246
. . .was my. . . .

292
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,486
What?

293
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,087
It was my first. . .

294
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,051
. . .time.

295
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:29,922
With Carol?

296
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:40,643
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one. . .?

297
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:45,449
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

298
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,807
There's a lot of stuff
we could've done tonight.

299
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,885
Okay, I got one.

300
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:56,685
Do you remember that vegetarian p�t�. . .

301
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,446
. . .that I made that you loved so much?

302
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,844
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!

303
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:11,411
Okay, fine. Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

304
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,723
What? You slept with Jason?

305
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:15,405
You'd already broken up.

306
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,846
How long?

307
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:17,968
A couple hours.

308
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,089
Oh, that's nice!

309
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,248
Okay, okay, I got one!

310
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:25,488
Anyway. . . .

311
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:29,327
The valentine Tom left
in your locker was really from me!

312
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:30,921
Excuse me?

313
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:35,083
Hello! Like he was really
gonna send you one.

314
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,488
She was a big girl!

315
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,766
Really? Well, at least. . .

316
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:47,243
. . .big girls don't pee in
their pants in seventh grade!

317
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,086
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

318
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,482
Oh, my God! There he is!
There he is!

319
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,845
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.

320
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:59,450
-Oh, he's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.

321
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,449
Come on, drop the towel.

322
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:13,442
Man, can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?

323
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,851
I think it's great.

324
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,804
You know, it's sweet.

325
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,050
It's romantic.

326
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,048
Really?

327
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,250
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

328
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,245
Hey, buddy!

329
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,284
That's attractive.

330
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:39,045
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

331
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,649
Admit it, all things considered,
you had fun tonight.

332
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,521
Where was the fun? Tell me specifically
which part was the fun part?

333
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,603
Where's my puck?

334
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,649
-The kid has it.
-The kid?

335
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:56,486
Excuse me, that's my puck.

336
00:19:56,732 --> 00:20:00,168
I found it. Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

337
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,250
You gotta do it, man.

338
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,250
Oh, yeah? I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you--

339
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:10,845
I can't do it.

340
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,251
Listen, give me back my puck.

341
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:15,642
Yes, how about it.

342
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:18,087
Come here.
Give me my puck.

343
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:19,890
No roughhousing in my ER!

344
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,485
Give me my puck!

345
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,648
Now that was fun.

346
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,566
Right foot, red.

347
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,844
Could've played Monopoly, but no!

348
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,241
Thanks.

349
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,081
Right hand, blue.

350
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,051
Good.

351
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,204
It's the VISA-card people.

352
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,125
Will you take my place?

353
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,209
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

354
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:24,881
No, I know. I haven't been
using it much.

355
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:28,482
Well, thanks.
But I'm okay, really.

356
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,046
To the green.

357
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,448
I've got magic beans.

358
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,291
No, never mind.

359
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,045
To the left! To the left!

360
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,050
I'm fine.

1
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,941
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,863
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,864
You reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:12,187
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:13,865
As far as I'm concerned. . .

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,228
. . .there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,301
Come on!

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,303
You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,667
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,870
You know what blows my mind?

11
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,188
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

12
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,381
You just look down,
and there they are.

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,025
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,827
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things. . .

15
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,384
. . .and then not even care.

16
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,027
Multiple orgasms!

17
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,147

Saturday night. The big night!

20
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,423
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

21
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,626
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!

22
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,542
Not even breaking up
with Janice?

23
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,941
Right, right. Shut up.

24
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,384
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

25
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,061
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

26
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,144
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

27
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,746
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

28
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:16,142
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

29
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,861
Why do you have to break up with her?

30
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,585
Be a man. Just stop calling.

31
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,948
If you want, I'll do it with you.

32
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,668
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

33
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,425
You break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

34
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,024
You're breaking up with Tony?

35
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,831
He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

36
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,222
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

37
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,944
Do you want anything else?

38
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,503
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

39
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,544
Nothing. I'm fine.

40
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,948
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

41
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,463
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

42
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,423
That guy, he burns me up.

43
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,863
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

44
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,909
It was horrible!
He called me ''young lady. ''

45
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,426
I hate when my father
calls me that.

46
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,628
Did he give you that
''You're not up to this'' thing again?

47
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,709
I got the extended disco
version with choruses of. . .

48
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,708
. . . ''You'll Never Make it on Your Own. ''

49
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,024
Hi, Joey.

50
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,346
Oh, my God! Angela!

51
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,623
Wow! Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

52
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,668
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

53
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,864
Yeah. No.

54
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,829
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

55
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,225
One Mississippi, two Mississippi. . .

56
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,587
. . .three Mississippi.
That seems cool.

57
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,019
Hey, Angela.

58
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,620
You look good.

59
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,023
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

60
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,386
You don't say.

61
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,659
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

62
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,221
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,022
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,983
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:29,064
-Who?
-Me!

66
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,583
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,059
Why don't. . . .

68
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,263
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,826
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,430
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

71
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,949
But there's a rat problem.

72
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,263
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

73
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,224
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all. . .

74
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,941
. . .fluffy.

75
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,860
Anyway, 7-ish?

76
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,187
Sure.

77
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,222
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

78
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,661
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

79
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,230
Bob is great.

80
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,468
He's smart, sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

81
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:22,465
You go on three auditions a month
and call yourself an actor. But Bob--

82
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,583
Come on! We were great together.

83
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:30,029
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

84
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,944
Sorry, Joey. You said,
''Let's just be friends. ''

85
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,590
So guess what?

86
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,827
-What?
-We're just friends.

87
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,664
Fine. Fine.

88
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:45,506
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

89
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,025
What ''four of us''?

90
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:50,581
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend. . .

91
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,267
. . .Monica.

92
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,269
I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

93
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,100
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

94
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:04,666
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's. . .

95
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,980
. . .brother.

96
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,147
He's smart, he's sophisticated. . .

97
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,063
. . .and he has a real job.

98
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,065
I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is--

99
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,824
-Oh, God help us.
-What?

100
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,465
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

101
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,420
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

102
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother. . .

103
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,023
. . .maybe Angela will come back to me.

104
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,422
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

105
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,030
I know, but. . . .

106
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,223
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

107
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,661
Will you help me? Please?

108
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:54,867
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

109
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,149
Hold on there, camper.
You've thought this through?

110
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,428
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

111
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,547
Just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

112
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,941
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

113
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,426
What are you saying?

114
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,980
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?

115
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,428
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

116
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:27,630
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

117
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,501
And the fabric softener?

118
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,381
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

119
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,426
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

120
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,026
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

121
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,420
I can pick something else
up on the way.

122
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,867
Thank you.

123
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,188
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

124
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,224
Yep.

125
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,987
Which?

126
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,625
Which what?

127
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,107
You've never met Bob, have you?

128
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,341
No, but--

129
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,866
For all we know,
he could be horribly--

130
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,022
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

131
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,021
Where are they? Where are they?

132
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,428
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

133
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,024
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

134
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,705
I don't wanna do that.

135
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,990
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

136
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,141
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

137
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,468
I had the most supremely awful day.

138
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:50,985
That's not good.

139
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,224
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

140
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,269
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

141
00:08:58,511 --> 00:08:59,466
They sucked.

142
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,589
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

143
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:05,629
And I got you. . . .

144
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,704
I'm looking. I'm looking.

145
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:11,147
I'm looking.

146
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,059
-I got you--
-What?

147
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,820
-What?
-What did you get me there?

148
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,420
I got you. . .

149
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,230
. . .these.

150
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,862
Bullwinkle socks.

151
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,386
-That's so sweet.
-I knew you had the Rockys.

152
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,622
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle. . .

153
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,829
. . .or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

154
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,828
Moose and squirrel.

155
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,828
Whatever you want.

156
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,271
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

157
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,229
No, I'm still working on mine.

158
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,667
That's it?

159
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,264
Yeah, it was really hard.

160
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,542
The hug looked pretty brutal.

161
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,419
You weren't there.

162
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,021
Coming through! Move! Move!

163
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,262
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

164
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,820
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

165
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,744
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

166
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,346
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

167
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,469
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

168
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,866
What?

169
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,068
No suds, no save, okay?

170
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,230
What's going on?

171
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:50,026
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

172
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,710
Was your basket on top?

173
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,067
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

174
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,744
You know, no suds, no save.

175
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,868
No suds, no--
Excuse me.

176
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,624
Hold on a second!

177
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,901
This is my friend's machine.

178
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,221
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

179
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,305
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

180
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,870
All right. Show's over.

181
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,827
Nothing to see here.

182
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's do laundry.

183
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:33,060
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

184
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:37,623
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle. . . .

185
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,588
You must need detergent.

186
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,268
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

187
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,183
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

188
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,302
Are you gonna separate those?

189
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, God.

190
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,266
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

191
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,186
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

192
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,547
Have you never done this before?

193
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,783
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

194
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,423
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

195
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,989
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

196
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:34,140
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

197
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,461
A whole other machine
for your colors.

198
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,430
And a third for your. . .

199
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,871
. . .delicates.
And that would be your bras. . .

200
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,228
. . .and your underpanty things.

201
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,227
These are white cotton panties.

202
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,820
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

203
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,422
That would be a judgment call.

204
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,109
He's so cute!

205
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,589
So where did you guys grow up?

206
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,822
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

207
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,109
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!

208
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,824
What?

209
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,461
I suddenly had the feeling I was. . .

210
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,224
. . .falling.

211
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,501
But I'm not.

212
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,661
So, you and Angela, huh?

213
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,027
Yep. Pretty much.

214
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,830
You're a lucky man.

215
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,867
You know what I miss
the most about her?

216
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:45,228
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

217
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,389
Like a happy little squirrel. . .

218
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,623
. . .or a weasel.

219
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,344
I never really noticed.

220
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,860
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

221
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,622
Monica. Monica is great.

222
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,021
Yeah, she is.

223
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,341
But it's not gonna last.

224
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,221
She's too much for me in bed.

225
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,346
Sexually.

226
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,664
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

227
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,139
Yeah, isn't he?

228
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,144
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny. . .

229
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,621
. . .and has an emotional age beyond 8.

230
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,227
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

231
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:33,143
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

232
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,385
That's nice.

233
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,264
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

234
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,345
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

235
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,024
Go! Go!

236
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,500
Hi, Janice.

237
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:08,266
I don't think we should
go out anymore.

238
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,830
All right.

239
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,029
Well, there you go.

240
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,349
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

241
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,828
I know this is gonna sound
really stupid. . .

242
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,221
. . .but I feel that if I can do this. . .

243
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,224
. . .if I can actually do
my own laundry. . .

244
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,228
. . .there isn't anything I can't do.

245
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,426
That does not sound stupid to me.

246
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:49,584
The first time I had to make dinner
for myself after Carol left me. . . .

247
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross. . . .

248
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:56,505
-Uh-oh.
-What, ''uh-oh''?

249
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,820
Uh-oh. . . .

250
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,829
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

251
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,863
It's a song.

252
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,863
The laundry song that we sing.

253
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:10,068
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

254
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:11,861
What's the matter?

255
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,146
Nothing. Nothing.

256
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,665
The laundry's done

257
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:15,946
Come on, show me.

258
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:20,104
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now. . .

259
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,827
. . .everything's kind of pink.

260
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,550
Everything's pink?

261
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,430
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

262
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:33,260
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

263
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,308
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

264
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,987
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

265
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,943
What am I doing? What am I doing?

266
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,228
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

267
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,820
I can't even do laundry!

268
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,668
Something went wrong
with Underdog. . .

269
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,027
. . .and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

270
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,824
So anyway. . .

271
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,704
. . .his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

272
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,826
And I'm thinking. . .

273
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,630
. . .how inappropriate this is.

274
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,825
Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

275
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,384
-Oh, my God!
-What?

276
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,225
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like. . .

277
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,626
. . .cocktails in Appalachia.

278
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,747
They're close.

279
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,949
Close? She's got her
tongue in his ear.

280
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:41,545
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

281
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,260
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's. . .

282
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,663
. . .not really true, is it?

283
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,503
Who's to say what's true?

284
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,786
What were you thinking?

285
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,465
I'm not proud of this, okay?

286
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,064
Maybe I am a little.

287
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,868
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!

288
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,868
You like him. I want her.

289
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,464
He likes you.

290
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,027
Really?

291
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us. . .

292
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,022
. . .we can break them up.

293
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

294
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,621
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

295
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,828
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

296
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,146
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

297
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:41,463
I'm the bing, bing, bing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.

298
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,030
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,147
I'm so sorry!

300
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:45,950
Are you okay?

301
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,067
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

302
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,230
I'll be right back.

303
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,741
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

304
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:59,347
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

305
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,263
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,710
How many have you had?

307
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,021
I don't know. A million!

308
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:10,988
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

309
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,666
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-All right.

310
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,623
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

311
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,583
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

312
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,065
How do you do that?

313
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,267
It's like a gift.

314
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,061
We should always break up together.

315
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,380
I'd like that!

316
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,423
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

317
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:56,862
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

318
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:03,666
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,300
Excuse me. We had this cart.

320
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,585
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

321
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,986
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

322
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:15,701
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

323
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,868
There aren't any clothes in it!

324
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,579
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

325
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,822
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

326
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,427
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart. . .

327
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:29,065
. . .you're gonna have to
take me with it!

328
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,868
Yes! Did you see that?

329
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,260
You were incredible.

330
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,860
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

331
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,346
I could not have
done this without you.

332
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,623
More clothes in the dryer?

333
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,827
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

334
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,226
Are you sure you're okay?

335
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,422
Does it still hurt?

336
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:13,626
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

337
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,466
How'd it go?

338
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,700
Excellent!

339
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:23,024
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

340
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,505
What a beautiful story.

341
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,105
I'm fine, by the way.

342
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:30,625
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:31,987
Where's Chandler?

344
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,903
He needed some time to grieve.

345
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,301
I'm free! I'm free!

346
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,824
That ought to do it.

00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,762
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:10,246
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,250
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,881
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:18,208
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,602
It's not just Freud,
it's Freud!

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,610
Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,125
Well, Eva. . .

9
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,850
. . .we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,730
And I would have to say. . .

11
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,847
. . .your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:41,684
All you want is a dinkle

13
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,805
What you envy's a schwang

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,209
A thing through which you can tinkle

15
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,972
To play with or simply let hang

16
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,288
The One With the Butt

17
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,561
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,008
I feel violated.

19
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:52,764
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off. . .

20
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,803
. . .to have something else to do?

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,441
Ross, 1 0:00.

22
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,410
Is it? It feels like 2.

23
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,410
No, 1 0:00!

24
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:07,001
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

25
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,207
Hello!

26
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:11,248
She's amazing!

27
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,087
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

28
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:17,890
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

29
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,844
And what would my opening line be?

30
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:21,411
Excuse me. . . .

31
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,122
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

32
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:29,210
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

33
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,210
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

34
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:37,841
But you always see these beautiful
women with these ''nothing'' guys.

35
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,003
You could be one of those guys.

36
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,724
-You could do that.
-You think?

37
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:43,802
Absolutely!

38
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,526
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

39
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,240
-I'm very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

40
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:50,641
Here goes.

41
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,123
Okay, next word would be. . .

42
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,321
. . .Chandler.

43
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,012
Chandler is my name and. . . .

44
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:07,328
Hi!

45
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,845
Yes, you said that.

46
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,925
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say. . .

47
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:16,123
. . .what I wanted to say was. . .

48
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:19,404
. . .would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

49
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:21,201
Chandler?

50
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,488
There he is!

51
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,081
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

52
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,411
What'd you think?

53
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,284
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

54
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,052
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

55
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,369
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

56
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,568
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

57
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,251
She said yes! She said yes!

58
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:47,210
Awful play, man!

59
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,845
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name ''Chandler. ''

60
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,844
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

61
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,010
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

62
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:04,931
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

63
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:06,247
Based on this play?

64
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,683
Based on this play!

65
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,407
Hey, kids!

66
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,968
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

67
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,841
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

68
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,366
How was your date, Chandler?

69
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,766
It was unbelievable!

70
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:37,567
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

71
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,046
She was in the Israeli army.

72
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,442
None of the bullets hit
the engine block. . .

73
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,967
. . .so we made it to the border.

74
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,003
But just barely and I. . . .

75
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,806
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,003
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

77
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,001
All right, once. . .

78
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,846
. . .once I got on the subway, right?

79
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,650
And it was at night. . .

80
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,406
. . .and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn. . .

81
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,010
. . .just for the hell of it.

82
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,280
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

83
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,368
More or less.

84
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:12,847
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

85
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:14,765
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is. . .?

86
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:16,806
''We'' is me and Rick.

87
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:17,928
Who's Rick?

88
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,366
Who's Rick?

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,522
My husband.

90
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:26,167
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.

91
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:30,209
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

92
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:32,765
No, I'm still married.

93
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,610
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me. . .

94
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,162
. . .sliding your foot
so far up my leg. . .

95
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:43,806
. . .you can count
the change in my pocket?

96
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,646
Don't worry.

97
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,730
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

98
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,521
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

99
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,489
Ethan is my. . .

100
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:57,888
. . .boyfriend.

101
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,247
What?!

102
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,045
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having. . .

103
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,720
. . .if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

104
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,001
I suppose, mainly sexual.

105
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,050
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

106
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:18,404
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

107
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,205
Didn't you listen to the story?

108
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,204
Didn't you listen to the story?

109
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:27,006
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

110
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,528
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get all the good stuff.

111
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:34,008
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex. . .

112
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,804
. . .and no responsibility.

113
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,090
This is every guy's fantasy!

114
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:41,726
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

115
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,610
No, of course not.

116
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,564
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

117
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:51,807
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

118
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,088
I couldn't.

119
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,281
Good for you.

120
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:56,642
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know. . .

121
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:59,605
. . .that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

122
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,122
You know. . .

123
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:04,210
. . .monogamy can be a tricky concept.

124
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:06,801
I mean, anthropologically speaking. . . .

125
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,403
Fine. Now you'll never know.

126
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,165
We're kidding. Tell us.

127
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:13,851
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

128
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,767
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey--

129
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,484
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

130
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,684
Look! I cleaned!

131
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,042
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

132
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,449
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

133
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,005
I don't know what it's for.

134
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,322
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

135
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,641
What do you think?

136
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,486
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

137
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,281
I see you moved the green ottoman.

138
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,485
How did that happen?

139
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,247
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

140
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:08,643
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

141
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,083
Yeah, it's interesting.

142
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,608
But you know what? Just for fun. . .

143
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:18,402
. . .let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

144
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,810
Just to compare.

145
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's see.

146
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,449
Well, it looks good there too.

147
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,928
Let's leave it there for a while.

148
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:30,611
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

149
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,808
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

150
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,809
She'll scratch your eyes out.

151
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,804
You guys, I am not that bad!

152
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,206
Yeah, you are.

153
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:42,005
Remember, I lived with you?

154
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:44,004
You were a little, you know. . . .

155
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,080
That is so unfair!

156
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,967
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

157
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,206
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

158
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,164
But, hey, I can be a kook!

159
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,443
All right, you madcap gal!

160
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,247
Try to imagine this.

161
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,001
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

162
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,048
Why not?

163
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,731
Because you're a kook!

164
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,411
lnstead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

165
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,441
I could do that.

166
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:24,440
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping. . .

167
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,370
. . .and I buy laundry detergent.

168
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,889
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

169
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,650
Why would someone do that?

170
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,808
One might wonder.

171
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,652
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

172
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,610
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

173
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:45,410
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood. . . .

174
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,641
Stop it!

175
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:51,440
Oh, my God!

176
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,723
It's true. Who am I?

177
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,168
Monica, you're Mom.

178
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,201
Oh, my God!

179
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,410
Okay, I'll be there.

180
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,205
That was my agent.

181
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:19,643
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

182
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:22,331
That's great!

183
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:23,648
What's the part?

184
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,808
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

185
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,804
This guy's why I became an actor.

186
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,242
''I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

187
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,211
This whole courtroom's out of order! ''

188
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:35,804
Seriously, what's the part?

189
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,567
''Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! ''

190
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,804
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

191
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,205
You're, you're. . . .
What?

192
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,967
I'm his butt double, okay?

193
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,646
I play Al Pacino's butt.

194
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:02,929
All right? He goes
into the shower, and then. . .

195
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,605
. . .I'm his butt.

196
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:06,601
Oh, my God!

197
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,007
Come on, you guys.

198
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,403
This is a real movie
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

199
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,005
Oh, no, it's terrific.

200
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,328
After all your years of struggling. . .

201
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,604
. . .you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

202
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:23,927
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.

203
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:25,525
This is a big break for me!

204
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,330
You're right. It is.

205
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,211
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

206
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,046
-I need to borrow some moisturizer.
-For what?

207
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,163
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

208
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,411
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

209
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,206
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

210
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:55,647
Thank you.

211
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,483
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-He's in the bathroom.

212
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:04,002
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.

213
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,041
My eyes! My eyes!

214
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:11,925
I warned you.

215
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,890
Who is being loud?

216
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,003
Oh, that would be Monica.

217
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:19,205
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

218
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,124
You got the whole night, huh?

219
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:24,523
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so. . . .

220
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,603
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

221
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:29,810
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me. . .

222
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,043
. . .it's worth it, okay?

223
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,368
In a relationship,
you have these key moments. . .

224
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,927
. . .you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

225
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,244
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

226
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,881
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

227
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,209
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

228
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,760
You know, the old Monica
would remind you. . .

229
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,601
. . .to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

230
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,803
But I'm not gonna do that.

231
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,602
Damn it! Hire the girl.

232
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,841
Okay, everybody ready?

233
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:11,087
Listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

234
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,281
Lose the robe.

235
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:15,328
Me?

236
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,766
That would work.

237
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:20,005
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

238
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,329
Okay, and the robe is lost.

239
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:26,765
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

240
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,246
Let's roll it.

241
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:29,805
Water's working.

242
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,290
And action!

243
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,645
And cut!

244
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,851
Butt guy, what are you doing?

245
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,441
I'm showering.

246
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:42,371
No, that was clenching.

247
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,801
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

248
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,202
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

249
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,006
I think his butt would be angry here.

250
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:55,531
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

251
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,205
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

252
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,003
And action!

253
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,611
And cut!

254
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:05,648
What was that?

255
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:09,167
I was going for quiet desperation.

256
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,211
But if you have to ask. . . .

257
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,404
God, I love these fingers.

258
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,767
Thank you.

259
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,406
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

260
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,807
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

261
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,650
-Oh, my God, I'm late!
-Oh, no, no, no.

262
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,690
-Don't go, don't go.
-Okay, okay.

263
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,489
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

264
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,646
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

265
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,410
I thought you talked to Rick.

266
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,449
It's not Rick.

267
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,688
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

268
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,525
No, it's Andrew.

269
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:57,803
I know there'll be many moments. . .

270
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:01,209
. . .when I'll regret asking
the following question, but. . . .

271
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,365
And Andrew is. . .?

272
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:04,448
He's. . .

273
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:05,607
. . .new.

274
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,890
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

275
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,447
No, that's not exactly what I was--

276
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,404
Most women would kill. . .

277
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,608
. . .for three guys like us.

278
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,240
So what do you want?

279
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:21,928
You.

280
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,851
-You have me.
-No, no. Just you.

281
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:26,208
What do you mean?

282
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,204
Lose the other guys.

283
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,810
Like, all of them?

284
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:35,325
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

285
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,603
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

286
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,042
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love. . .

287
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,965
. . .without feeling obligated
to one another?

288
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,808
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

289
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,803
Well, part of me wants that. . .

290
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,128
. . .but it's like I'm two guys.

291
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,205
I mean, one guy's saying,
''Shut up! This is great! ''

292
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,964
But there's this other guy.

293
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,050
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart. . .

294
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,011
. . .grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

295
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:08,611
He's saying, you know,
''This is too hard. Get out, get out! ''

296
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,165
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

297
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:16,762
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

298
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:19,368
Which one?

299
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,128
The second guy.

300
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,881
I see.

301
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,608
Call me if you change your mind.

302
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:45,004
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

303
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,085
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

304
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,562
Right? I mean, this woman was. . .

305
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,330
. . .unbelievably sexy. . .

306
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:08,769
. . .and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable. . . .

307
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,803
Tell me why you did this again?

308
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,485
Movie star!

309
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:20,207
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

310
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,288
Nope.

311
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,001
No? What happened, big guy?

312
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,605
Big guy?

313
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,808
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.

314
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:33,722
I got fired!

315
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,763
They said I acted too much with it.

316
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,244
I told everybody about this.

317
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,329
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

318
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:46,006
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

319
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,805
My mom will.

320
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,643
There's something so sweet. . .

321
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,008
. . .and disturbing about that.

322
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,050
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years. . .

323
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,170
. . .and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

324
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,044
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

325
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:07,609
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

326
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,607
Did it feel like your shot?

327
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:14,440
Hard to tell. I was naked.

328
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,205
I don't think this was your shot.

329
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,607
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

330
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,043
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

331
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:26,001
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go. . .

332
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:29,727
. . . ''I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass! ''

333
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,406
You think? That's so nice.

334
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

335
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,201
Good night.

336
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,688
You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

337
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:55,803
Really? Just casually
strewn about. . .

338
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,207
. . .in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

339
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,601
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

340
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,401
Whenever.

341
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,611
She is a kook.

342
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:29,005
If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.

343
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,000
No, don 't do this!

344
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,605
This is stupid!

345
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,810
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

346
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,244
But then everyone will know.

347
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:45,810
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

348
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,685
I need help!

Everybody! Central Perk

. . .the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:13,561
Thanks.

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,444
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment. . .

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,121
. . .when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,000
Here we go.

7
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,404
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, great! This is just--

00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,676
The One With the Blackout

English Subtitles by

11
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:40,203
This is so cool, you guys.

12
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,401
The entire city's blacked out.

13
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,034
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens. . .

14
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,475
. . .and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

15
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,164
You guys, this is big.

16
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,600
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

17
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,517
Who will I meet in a blackout?

18
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:58,196
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

19
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,402
Can we talk about this later?

20
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,434
Can I borrow the phone?

21
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:05,802
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

22
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,479
What's my number?

23
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,957
I never call me.

24
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,038
Oh, my God! It's her.

25
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,196
It's that Victoria Secret model.

26
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,724
Something Goodacre.

27
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,239
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

28
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,794
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.

29
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,838
Oh, my God!

30
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,760
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

31
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:31,797
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?

32
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:35,794
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

33
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,554
I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

34
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,636
Jill says vestibule...

35
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,001
...I'm going with vestibule.

36
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm fine.

37
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,997
No, I'm not alone.

38
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,964
I don't know, some guy.

39
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,244
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

40
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,045
Hey Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.

41
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,924
Yes, he was some guy.

42
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:11,403
Hey, everyone.

43
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,284
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

44
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:28,643
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have. . .

45
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,034
. . .so happy Hanukkah!

46
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:35,202
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

47
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,202
That had to hurt!

48
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,438
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes...

49
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,358
...and you still haven 't said
one word. Oh, God!

50
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:55,194
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!

51
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,118
There you go.

52
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,841
You're definitely scaring her.

53
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,516
Would you like to call somebody?

54
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,395
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

55
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,197
Yeah, thanks.

56
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,401
It's me.

57
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,515
It's Chandler.

58
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,754
Are you okay?

59
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,404
I'm fine.

60
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:32,394
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule. . .

61
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,523
. . .with Jill Goodacre.

62
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,161
What?

63
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,202
I'm stuck. . .

64
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,479
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .

65
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,801
. . .with Jill Goodacre.

66
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,837
I have no idea what you said.

67
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,882
Put Joey on the phone.

68
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:54,961
What's up, man?

69
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:56,433
I'm stuck. . .

70
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,645
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .

71
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,799
. . .with Jill Goodacre!

72
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:05,034
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,436
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre!

74
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,474
Chandler, listen.

75
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,004
Like that thought
never entered my mind.

76
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,759
Come on, somebody.

77
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,239
I'll go. I'll go.

78
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:28,484
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.

79
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,118
Pool table?

80
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,003
That's my sister.

81
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,804
My weirdest place would have to be. . .

82
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,402
. . .the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

83
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,403
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a library?

84
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,003
Pheebs, what about you?

85
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,204
Milwaukee.

86
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,083
Ross?

87
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:00,955
Disneyland, 1989.
''It's a small world after all. ''

88
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,280
No way!

89
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,799
The ride broke down. . .

90
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,964
. . .so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

91
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:15,597
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

92
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,840
Rachel?

93
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,194
I already went.

94
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,242
-You did not go.
-Yes, I did.

95
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,958
Tell us. Come on.

96
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,800
The weirdest place would have to be. . .

97
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32,002
. . .the foot of the bed.

98
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,119
-Step back!
-We have a winner!

99
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,116
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

100
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,278
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

101
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:56,561
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

102
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,124
Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature golf course.

103
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,155
Come on.

104
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,959
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

105
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,881
And you didn't marry him because. . .?

106
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:14,121
Do you think there are people
that go through life. . .

107
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,674
. . .never having that kind of. . .?

108
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,438
-Probably.
-Really?

109
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,836
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

110
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,484
-Yeah, right.
-It is.

111
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,315
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

112
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:31,161
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and. . . .

113
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,276
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

114
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,434
For all those people who miss out
on that passion thing. . .

115
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,198
. . .there's other good stuff.

116
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,322
But I don't think that'll be you.

117
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,360
You don't?

118
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,915
I see big passion in your future.

119
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:56,921
Really?

120
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,119
-You do?
-I do.

121
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,198
Ross, you're so great.

122
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,001
It's never gonna happen.

123
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:21,515
What?

124
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,595
You and Rachel.

125
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:32,600
Why not?

126
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,954
Because you waited too long
to make your move. . .

127
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,998
. . .and now you're in the ''Friend Zone. ''

128
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:42,954
I'm not in the Zone.

129
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,161
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

130
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,400
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

131
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,402
I'm laying the groundwork.

132
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,073
Every day I get
a little bit closer to. . . .

133
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,394
Priesthood!

134
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,802
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

135
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:05,078
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

136
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:06,724
I will, I will.

137
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,195
I'm waiting for the right moment.

138
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,999
What?

139
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,481
What, now?

140
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:18,719
What's messing you up?
The wine?

141
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,604
The candles? The moonlight?

142
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,195
You gotta go up to her and say,
''Look, Rachel, I think--''

143
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,917
-What are we shushing?
-We're shushing. . .

144
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,477
. . .because we're trying to
hear something.

145
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,999
What?

146
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,998
Don't you hear that?

147
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,399
See?

148
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,438
Would you like some gum?

149
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,561
Is it sugarless?

150
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,041
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then, no thanks.

151
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,604
What the hell was that?

152
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,839
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

153
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,998
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!

154
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,317
New York City has no power

155
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:15,001
And the milk is getting sour

156
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,442
But to me it is not scary

157
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,598
'Cause I stay away from dairy

158
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:32,804
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?

159
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,404
-I'll do it.
-Want help?

160
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:36,795
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

161
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,320
Good luck, man.

162
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,399
Thanks.

163
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,843
-Where you going?
-Outside.

164
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't!

165
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,441
Why not?

166
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,721
Because of the reason.

167
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:00,681
That would be. . .?

168
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,081
I can't tell you.

169
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:04,360
What's going on?

170
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:09,878
Listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

171
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,838
-About what?
-He's planning your birthday party.

172
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,237
Oh, my God! I love him!

173
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:17,884
You better act surprised.

174
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,921
About what?

175
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,314
My surprise party.

176
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:24,404
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

177
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,438
Well, he didn't tell me.

178
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,838
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

179
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:33,236
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

180
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,316
You are not. We tell you stuff.

181
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:40,642
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

182
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:45,199
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

183
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,076
Looks like I was second to last.

184
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,203
It's so nice.

185
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,397
I have a question.

186
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,439
Actually, it's not
so much a question. . .

187
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,199
. . .it's more of a general wondering. . . .

188
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,393
--ment.

189
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,998
Here goes.

190
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,194
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to. . . .

191
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,923
Yes, that's right.

192
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,355
Look at that little kitty!

193
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:35,236
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation

194
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:40,400
And the only explanation I can find

195
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,561
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around

196
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:50,004
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

197
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,395
Sorry, that was wax.

198
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:00,642
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

199
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:03,115
Why not put ''poor little Tootie''
in the hall?

200
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,884
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

201
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,599
On second thought,
gum would be perfection.

202
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,563
Gum would be perfection?

203
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,795
Gum would be perfection.

204
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,441
Could've said, ''Gum would be nice. ''
''I'll have a stick. '' But, no.

205
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,757
For me, gum is perfection.

206
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,558
I loathe myself!

207
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:36,395
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

208
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:44,284
We just found this cat. . .

209
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,958
. . .and we're looking for the owner.

210
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,481
It's mine.

211
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,319
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

212
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,237
It's my cat. Give me my cat.

213
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,803
Wait a minute. What's his name?

214
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,754
Bob-- Buttons.

215
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:00,995
Bob Buttons?

216
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,562
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

217
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,005
You are a very bad man!

218
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,003
You owe me a cat.

219
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,003
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

220
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:21,805
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty?

221
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,197
Come on, lucky sixes!

222
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,724
Everybody, this is Paolo.

223
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,201
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

224
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,242
This is Monica. . .

225
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,798
. . .and Joey. . .

226
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:53,803
. . .and Ross.

227
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,200
He doesn't speak much English.

228
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,202
Monopoly!

229
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,323
Look at that!

230
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:13,838
Where did Paolo come from?

231
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,277
Italy, I think.

232
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:20,274
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

233
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:25,524
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

234
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,402
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

235
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,004
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

236
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,554
I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

237
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:43,004
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

238
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,196
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

239
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,081
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

240
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,639
You betcha!

241
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:03,157
All right. Okay. What next?

242
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,438
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

243
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,239
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.

244
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,798
Here we go.

245
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,398
Nice going, imp!

246
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,520
It's okay. All I need to do is...

247
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,683
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

248
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:36,235
Good save!
We're back on track and I'm...

249
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,484
...chewing someone else's gum.

250
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,244
This is not my gum!

251
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,242
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

252
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,996
And now you're choking.

253
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:49,915
You all right?

254
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,803
Oh, my God!
You're choking!

255
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,993
Better?

256
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,397
Thank you. That was. . . .

257
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:04,835
That was. . . .

258
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:06,435
Perfection?

259
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,003
What'd he say that was so funny?

260
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:32,805
I have absolutely no idea.

261
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:35,122
That's classic.

262
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,242
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?

263
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,237
This is so un-me!

264
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:40,918
If you want, I'll do it.

265
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:45,719
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

266
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:48,004
But I won't.

267
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,196
The first time he smiled at me. . .

268
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,358
. . .those seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

269
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:56,924
Did you rent mopeds?

270
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,404
Because I've heard--

271
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,155
Oh, it's not about that right now.

272
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:07,195
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common. . .

273
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,834
. . . .and we don't even speak
the same language. . .

274
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,478
. . .but God!

275
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:20,004
Listen. . . .

276
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,001
Listen, something you should know.

277
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,234
Rachel and I are. . . .

278
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,794
We're kind of a thing.

279
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:35,845
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

280
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,241
You have the sex?

281
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:45,197
Technically, the sex is not being had.
But that's. . . .

282
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,284
That's not the point.

283
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,277
The point is that
Rachel and I should be. . . .

284
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,605
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

285
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:57,602
And if you get in the. . . .

286
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,399
In bed?

287
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,357
No, not where I was going.

288
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:08,320
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing. . .

289
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,284
. . .then I would be, well, very sad.

290
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,354
So do you. . .?

291
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,283
You do know a little English?

292
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,401
Little.

293
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,121
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

294
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,999
That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

295
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:39,555
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

296
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:40,993
Ready?

297
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,404
Now try it.

298
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,597
You gotta whip it.

299
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,996
Look, look! The last candle's
about to burn out.

300
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:02,238
1 0, 9, 8, 7. . .

301
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:06,683
. . .minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48. . . .

302
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,796
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

303
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,843
Kind of spooky without any lights.

304
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,605
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

305
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,320
This isn't the best time
to bring it up. . .

306
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,999
. . .but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

307
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:52,562
This has been fun.

308
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:56,036
Yes. Thanks for letting me
use your phone. . .

309
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,242
. . .and for saving my life.

310
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,118
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

311
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,276
I had a great blackout.

312
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,399
See you.

313
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:26,001
I'm account number 7143457. And I don't
know if you got any of that. . .

314
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:29,595
. . .but I would really
like a copy of the tape.

00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,526
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,654
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,046
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:18,045
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,764
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:23,252
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,886
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

8
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,732
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,731
He is cute.

10
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:35,046
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,609
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:37,772
Oh, God!

13
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,330
I just--

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,644
You're nice-- Oh, God.

15
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,525
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

16
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:46,845
Okay. Bye-bye.

17

19
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:37,285
It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,004
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

21
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,644
When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

22
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:48,931
. . .possibly. . .

23
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,165
. . .you might be.

24
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,212
You did?

25
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:55,653
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

26
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,614
. . .so then I figured maybe not.

27
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:04,011
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

28
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,285
-I did.
-I think so.

29
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,852
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

30
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:13,847
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

31
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:15,495
You're kidding.

32
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,972
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

33
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,644
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

34
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:25,132
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

35
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:28,804
. . .who also liked her.

36
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,413
Well, this is fascinating.

37
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:37,814
So what is it about me?

38
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:41,613
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

39
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,086
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

40
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,326
Yeah, right!

41
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,891
What is it?

42
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,928
I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

43
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,006
Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,609
Yeah, a quality.

45
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:59,209
''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

46
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,048
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

47
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:11,094
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

48
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,854
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

49
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,934
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:26,250
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:28,009
I'm talking to Rome.

52
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,369
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,969
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,011
Oh, God.

55
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:38,975
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:51,894
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:56,566
How's she doing?

58
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,605
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,849
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

60
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,848
I'm glad you're here.

61
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,815
What's with your hair?

62
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,125
What?

63
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,652
What's different?

64
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:11,972
Nothing.

65
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,452
Oh, maybe that's it.

66
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,735
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

67
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,164
Okay, relax.

68
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,810
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

69
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:23,735
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

70
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,250
Oh, God!

71
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:35,012
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

72
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:37,892
Yeah, they were gross.

73
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,414
You know what I love?

74
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,368
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

75
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:45,648
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

76
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,808
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

77
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,332
Mrs. Geller?

78
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,370
She looks so small.

79
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:58,805
I know.

80
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:03,206
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

81
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:08,335
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,172
Bye, Nana.

83
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,611
Nurse!

84
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:26,330
What is going on?

85
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,815
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,495
Well, she's not quite.

87
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,852
What?

88
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:37,685
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,125
What's going on?

90
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:40,968
She may have died.

91
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,004
''She may have died''?

92
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,484
We're looking into it.

93
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:47,855
I'll go see.

94
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,454
This almost never happens.

95
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:11,252
Now she's passed.

96
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,692
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,450
Is it my hair?

98
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,928
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:30,246
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

100
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,124
So did she. . .?

101
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:39,924
Twice.

102
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,608
Oh, that sucks.

103
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:46,851
You guys okay?

104
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,854
I don't know. It's weird.

105
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:52,452
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel. . . .

106
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,573
Maybe she's not really gone.

107
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:56,209
No, no, she's gone.

108
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,324
We checked.

109
00:06:58,776 --> 00:06:59,765
A lot.

110
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,849
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

111
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,849
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .

112
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:10,691
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

113
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:17,010
And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high. . .

114
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:20,208
. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

115
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,851
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .

116
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,405
. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.

117
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:32,126
I miss her.

118
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,445
Here, Pheebs.

119
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:35,651
Want this?

120
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:37,852
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

121
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,212
I just sharpened her this morning.

122
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,408
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .

123
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,045
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

124
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,814
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

125
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,615
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

126
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,807
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

127
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,849
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

128
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:20,044
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

129
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,094
I don't see why not.

130
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:41,611
Here's my retainer!

131
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,368
I was just thinking. . .

132
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,493
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!

133
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:55,885
Listen to me!

134
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,125
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

135
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:04,612
You what?

136
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:08,568
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

137
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,004
Define ''fun. ''

138
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:16,175
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .

139
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,608
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

140
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:22,249
Everyone thinks they know me.

141
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,454
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''

142
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:30,247
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''

143
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,487
That's probably what they'll say.

144
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,529
I'd like that.

145
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:49,772
Hey, gorgeous.

146
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,055
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

147
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:58,414
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

148
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,254
Okay. Phew!

149
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,536
So what do you think it is about me?

150
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:08,805
I don't know what.

151
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,813
You just have. . .

152
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,813
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.

153
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:16,845
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

154
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:22,575
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

155
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,891
What? He's cute.

156
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:25,410
Well, yeah.

157
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,732
He's no Brian in Payroll.

158
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,605
Is Brian. . .?

159
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:35,212
I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .

160
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,169
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

161
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,765
I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

162
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:49,450
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

163
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,447
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

164
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,495
I'm really not.

165
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:00,845
This one?

166
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,532
I've shown you every dress we have.

167
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:11,530
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .

168
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,812
. . .go with the burgundy.

169
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,613
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

170
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,926
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

171
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:22,815
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

172
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,654
Wait! We need shoes.

173
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:33,806
How about these?

174
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,088
That's really a day shoe.

175
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,294
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

176
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:43,085
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

177
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:51,614
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

178
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:55,210
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

179
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,292
No, it really should be burgundy.

180
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,726
Unless we go with a different dress.

181
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,853
No, no, no. Watch this.

182
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,168
Wait, I may have something in the back.

183
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,610
Oh, my God.

184
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,694
Is everything all right?

185
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,487
Just Nana's stuff.

186
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,855
How we doing?
You guys ready?

187
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,735
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

188
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,206
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

189
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,606
Some days it's all I can think about.

190
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:57,334
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

191
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,329
You mean your earrings?

192
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,045
What did I say?

193
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,368
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

194
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,529
What? We don't have shoes here?

195
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,374
Morning. We ready to go?

196
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,493
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

197
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,332
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

198
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,768
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.

199
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,408
Come here, sweetheart.

200
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,532
You know. . .

201
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:45,414
. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

202
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,292
What?

203
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:55,886
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

204
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:59,531
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

205
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,612
You're watching football at a funeral?

206
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:06,405
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,605
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:13,648
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

209
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,614
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,690
God, what a great day!

211
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:24,447
What? Weatherwise.

212
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,169
I know.

213
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:30,131
The air, the trees.

214
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:34,615
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--

215
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,407
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:39,930
No, I'm fine.

217
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,615
Just. . .

218
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:45,131
. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .

219
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:56,088
I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

220
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,135
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

221
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,332
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,088
Here, sweetie. Here.

223
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,372
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

224
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:10,572
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:19,765
Sorry.

226
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,135
Hi, I'm Andrea.

227
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,407
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

228
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:28,006
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

229
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,375
Look who's up!

230
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:34,566
How do you feel?

231
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,335
I feel great.

232
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,091
I feel great. I feel great.

233
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,493
Wow, those pills really worked.

234
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,649
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two. . . .

235
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,688
I love you guys.

236
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,532
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

237
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,892
I love Pheebs.

238
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:01,970
That's so nice.

239
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:05,651
I love you, man.

240
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,805
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

241
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,528
It doesn't matter to me.

242
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,205
You were right.

243
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,974
I love you the most.

244
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,812
Well, you know who I love the most?

245
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:39,445
You!

246
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,407
Oh, you don't get it!

247
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,815
What do you got there?

248
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,088
Just a hearing disability.

249
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:56,006
What's the score?

250
00:16:57,536 --> 00:17:00,528
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

251
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:01,765
Beautiful!

252
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,606
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

253
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:18,007
Your grandmother would've hated this.

254
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,849
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

255
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,251
No, I'd be hearing about. . .

256
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:29,056
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

257
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:32,732
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .

258
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:36,213
. . . ''Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''

259
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,734
That sounds like Nana.

260
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,610
Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .

261
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:47,374
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

262
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,011
I can imagine.

263
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,929
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .

264
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:58,168
. . .to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

265
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,807
That is a wonder!

266
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,892
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .

267
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:12,048
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .

268
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,725
. . .would you tell her?

269
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,292
Tell her what?

270
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:21,008
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

271
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,213
Like your hair, for example.

272
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:27,486
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

273
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:32,332
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

274
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:41,211
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

275
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:44,209
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

276
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,205
More wine?

277
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:51,214
Oh, I think so.

278
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,690
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

279
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:04,971
Thank you.

280
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:06,965
They're yours.

281
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,852
Actually, they were Nana's.

282
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,014
Now I'm depressed!

283
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,412
Even more than I was.

284
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,812
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

285
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:34,052
That little naked guy would be me.

286
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,288
Look at the little thing!

287
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,484
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

288
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,008
Can we be grownups now?

289
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:47,049
Who are those people?

290
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,092
Got me.

291
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,810
That's Nana right there in the middle.

292
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:52,971
Yeah, let's see.

293
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:55,776
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''

294
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,046
Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

295
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,411
How old was she there?

296
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,447
Let's see, '' 1 939. ''

297
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:03,614
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

298
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,568
It looks like a fun gang.

299
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:15,253
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

300
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,889
Let me see!

301
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:21,211
No, no. That would be me again.

302
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,126
I'm just trying something.

303
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:39,971
Hey, Lowell.

304
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:41,570
Oh, hey, Chandler.

305
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,051
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

306
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:49,447
It's like Mardi gras without
the papier-m�ch� heads.

307
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,731
How about you?

308
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:52,813
Good. Good. Listen. . .

309
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,608
. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .

310
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,015
. . .I'm not.

311
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,212
I know. That's what I told her.

312
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,811
Really?

313
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:07,768
So you can tell?

314
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:13,774
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

315
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,453
So you don't think I have. . .

316
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:18,486
. . .a quaIity?

317
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:23,130
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

318
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,693
By the way, your friend, Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

319
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,251
He is?

320
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,287
And way out of your league.

321
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,409
Out of my league!

322
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:41,615
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

323
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,614
Hey, Brian.

1
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:10,687
Terry, I know I haven't
worked here long. . .

2
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:13,207
. . .but I was wondering,
would it be possible. . .

3
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:16,410
. . .if I got a $ 100 advance
on my salary?

4
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:18,160
An advance?

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,727
So that I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

6
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:25,011
Every year we ski in Vail, and
my father pays for my ticket. . .

7
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:28,483
. . .but I've started
this whole independent thing. . .

8
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:31,604
. . .which is actually why
I took this ''job. ''

9
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,885
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

10
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,006
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,286
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,726
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:52,605
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

14
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,683
I really do.

15
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,288
Does anybody need coffee?

16
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:04,883
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

English Subtitles by

18
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:52,728
Excuse me, sir?

19
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,486
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

20
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:59,526
. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

21
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:05,881
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

22
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,403
Only 98.50 to go!

23
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:15,128
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,249
What? No, they're not.

25
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:18,845
The Blymans invited them.

26
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:19,922
You're wrong.

27
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:22,727
I am not wrong.

28
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,882
You're wrong.

29
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,930
No, I just talked to them.

30
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:29,807
I'm calling Mom.

31
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,201
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:49,328
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

33
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:53,405
I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

34
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,324
. . .man/woman. ''

35
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,326
What were you modeling?

36
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,642
You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

37
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,282
So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

38
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,602
The asthma guy's really cute.

39
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:09,090
Know which one you're gonna be?

40
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,522
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

41
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,603
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

42
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,007
Thanks.

43
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,887
You were right.
How can they do this to us?

44
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,690
It's Thanksgiving!

45
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,888
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

46
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,565
I'll make it just like Mom's.

47
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,890
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

48
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,082
They're not actually supposed to--

49
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,084
I'll work on the lumps.

50
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,928
Joey, you're going home, right?

51
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:42,881
Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

52
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,123
Yes. Every single one of them.

53
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,684
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

54
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:53,487
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

55
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,122
So you're free Thursday, then?

56
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:02,488
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

57
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,123
Rach, you still going to Vail?

58
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,284
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

59
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:11,602
Only $ 1 02 to go.

60
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,967
I thought it was 98.50?

61
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,772
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

62
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,363
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

63
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,483
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

64
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,086
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

65
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,484
. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

66
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:40,321
Is Carol here?

67
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,608
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

68
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,691
I just came by to pick up my skull.

69
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,008
Well, not mine, but. . . .

70
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,891
Come in.

71
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:55,411
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:56,607
What's it look like?

73
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,607
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:05,324
I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,483
You can just look for it.

76
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:17,884
You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

77
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,927
You know, you have to take a course.

78
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,563
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

79
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,445
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

80
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,286
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

81
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,364
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

82
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,682
Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

83
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,081
. . .crazy?

84
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,085
What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

85
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,727
You're not serious? I mean. . .

86
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,405
. . .you really talk to it?

87
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:03,163
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

88
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,249
Do you talk about me?

89
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,048
All the time.

90
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,088
Really?

91
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,089
We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

92
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:30,282
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

93
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,688
Not that I believe any of this.

94
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:36,368
I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

95
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,363
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

96
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:43,002
But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

97
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:46,289
. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

98
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:51,687
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

99
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,882
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

100
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,532
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

101
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,683
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

102
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:09,288
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

103
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,921
Here's your mail.

104
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,288
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

105
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,083
Here's your mail!

106
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:24,288
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

107
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,490
Would you just open it!

108
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,889
Oh, my God!

109
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:34,090
You guys are great!

110
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,363
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:37,527
We did?

112
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,330
You owe me $20.

113
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,921
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,241
Chandler, here you go.

115
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,847
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

116
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,926
. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

117
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,402
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

118
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,086
What is it with you
and this holiday?

119
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:57,851
I'm 9 years old.

120
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,571
I hate this story!

121
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

122
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,723
I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

123
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,928
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

124
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:09,926
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

125
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,406
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:15,884
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

127
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,730
We used to work together.

128
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:36,848
We did?

129
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,484
At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

130
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:43,083
I was the Aramis guy.

131
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:46,892
Aramis? Aramis?

132
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,127
Yeah, right!

133
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:52,162
You're the best in the business.

134
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:53,891
-Get out!
-I'm serious!

135
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:58,091
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

136
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,882
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

137
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:07,568
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

138
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,364
Nothing.

139
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,367
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

140
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,285
Yeah, that would be--

141
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,530
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

142
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,491
What?

143
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,251
Leave.

144
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,488
Wait, wait, wait!

145
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,571
I guess you all saw it.

146
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:20,928
Saw what?

147
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:24,722
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

148
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:47,446
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

149
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,527
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

150
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,805
Looking good! Okay!

151
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:09,284
Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

152
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,326
What?

153
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:15,202
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

154
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,566
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

155
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,291
Well, that's closer.

156
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,285
I got the tickets!

157
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:27,320
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

158
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,927
Oh, you must stop shooping.

159
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm gonna get my stuff.

160
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,444
Will you just come in, already?

161
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:38,162
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

162
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:41,484
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

163
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:51,686
We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

164
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,842
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

165
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:58,690
That's not a question.

166
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,692
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

167
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:05,686
A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

168
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,282
I mean it's. . .

169
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:13,084
. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

170
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:15,728
All right. Fine.

171
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:19,123
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

172
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,488
. . .and in the form of Tots.

173
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,167
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

174
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:30,084
Mom never hit.

175
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,290
Okay, all done.

176
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,890
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

177
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,491
Ross needs lumps!

178
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,523
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

179
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,488
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

180
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,281
Why would we do that?

181
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,921
Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

182
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,400
. . .before she died.

183
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:00,691
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

184
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,969
Goodbye, you guys!

185
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,281
Thanks for everything!

186
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:09,286
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:14,527
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

188
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:15,528
The balloon?

189
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,247
No, the actual cartoon character.

190
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,648
Of course the balloon!

191
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,291
It's all over the news.

192
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:27,241
He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

193
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,010
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

194
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,605
I can't. I gotta go!

195
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,288
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

196
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,084
Almost never.

197
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:37,687
Got the keys?

198
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,446
Anytime you're ready!

199
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,084
Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,291
Where am I talking to here?

201
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:02,884
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

202
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,605
Just aim for the bump.

203
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,090
Okay, here goes.

204
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,728
You know, I can't do this.

205
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:24,968
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

206
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,766
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

207
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,283
Hello, baby!

208
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,921
--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

209
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,209
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

210
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:47,202
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

211
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,090
. . .and juicy on the inside.

212
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,284
Why are we standing here?

213
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,768
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

214
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:57,485
No, I don't.

215
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,321
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

216
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,689
No, I didn't. I asked. . .

217
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,048
. . . ''Got the keys?''

218
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,762
You said, ''Got the keys! ''

219
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:13,685
Either of you have the keys?

220
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,082
The oven is on!

221
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,771
I've gotta get my ticket!

222
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,650
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

223
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:20,881
Then get it!

224
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,362
That tone won't make me go any faster.

225
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:25,886
That one will.

226
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:33,090
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

227
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,086
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

228
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:43,287
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

229
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,491
You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

230
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,611
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

231
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,412
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

232
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,605
How's it going?

233
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,683
Here we come

234
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,689
Walking down the street

235
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:05,720
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

236
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,291
Hey, hey--

237
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,125
-Did you feel that?
-I did.

238
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,522
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

239
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:17,285
Keep singing! Keep singing!

240
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:20,283
Hey, hey, you're my baby

241
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,287
And I can 't wait to meet you

242
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,280
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

243
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,770
I felt it that time!

244
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,331
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

245
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,291
I'm the one without any breasts

246
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,287
Not that one.

247
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,124
Can you go any faster?

248
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:45,285
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

249
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,285
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

250
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,881
For an emergency just like this.

251
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,566
All right. Listen, smirky!

252
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,723
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

253
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:01,568
. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

254
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,211
I swear you said you had the keys!

255
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:08,012
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

256
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,123
I obviously did not have the keys!

257
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,284
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

258
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,082
Why would I have the keys!

259
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:20,643
Besides the fact that
you said you did?

260
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,002
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

261
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,401
-Why?
-Because!

262
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,682
Because everything's
my responsibility?

263
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,247
Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:33,405
Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

265
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,486
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

266
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:43,130
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

267
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,283
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

268
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,007
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

269
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,807
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

270
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,402
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

271
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,086
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

272
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,288
The turkey's burnt!

273
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:11,087
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

274
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,320
Here we come

275
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,683
Walking down the--

276
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,082
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

277
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,401
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

278
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,768
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

279
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,486
God, this is great!

280
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,809
The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

281
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:37,886
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

282
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,081
Oh, really?

283
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:43,166
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

284
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:44,447
You call that delicious?

285
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,570
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,448
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

287
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,042
What?

288
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,648
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

289
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:17,132
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

290
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,441
Ugly Naked Guy. . .

291
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,525
. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

292
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,090
I gotta see this!

293
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,208
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

294
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:33,087
Ugly naked dancing!

295
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,207
It's nice that he has someone.

296
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:47,681
Shall I carve?

297
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:49,767
By all means.

298
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,685
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

299
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,485
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

300
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,481
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

301
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:07,131
You guys have to make a wish.

302
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:08,962
Make a wish?

303
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,282
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

304
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,405
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

305
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,884
The bigger half.

306
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:25,282
All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

307
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,683
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

308
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:31,045
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

309
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,921
. . .but for me this has
been really great.

310
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:38,482
I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

311
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,284
. . .or projectile vomiting.

312
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,210
If you had gone to Vail. . .

313
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,888
. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

314
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:49,971
. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

315
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,090
. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

316
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,806
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

317
00:20:57,052 --> 00:21:01,682
. . .I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

318
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,889
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

319
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:10,088
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

320
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,288
And a crappy New Year!

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,010
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,138
Wait, wait. What is that?

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,932
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,329
No, I don't.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,531
He is precious!
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,771
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,339
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,617
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,451
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,378
Is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,578
It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so. . . .

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,538
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,537
I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,850
. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,656
Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
Sanskrit for ''cool way to live. ''

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,816
The One With the Monkey

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,089
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,772
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,538
I have 12 new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,731
Might want to open with the snowman.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,853
So how'd it go?

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,698
I didn't get the job.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,498
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,733
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,417
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,729
What are you gonna be?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,737
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,813
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,939
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,013
Hey, what? What is wrong
with New Year's?

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,333
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure. . .

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,368
. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,178
Man, I'm talking loud!

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,136
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

35
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,416
I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,139
Yeah, you wish.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,094
I'm sick of being a victim
this Dick Clark holiday.

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,734
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,857
Just the six of us. Dinner.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,739
-Sure.
-Fine.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,210
I was hoping for a little
more enthusiasm.

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,776
You're on.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,339
Oh, good.

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand. . .

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,450
. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,969
Thanks. Hi.

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,495
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,578
I made a man with eyes of coal

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,892
And a smile so bewitchin '

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,968
How was I supposed to know

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,973
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,095
My mother's ashes

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,373
Even her eyelashes

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,938
Are resting in a little yellow jar

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,659
And sometimes when it's freezing

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,459
I feel a little sneezy

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,535
And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,576
Noisy boys.

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,893
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,299
No, that's okay.

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,333
If it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing. . .

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,418
. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,690
That guy's going home with a note.

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,656
-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,015
Sorry.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,649
I was saying you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,532
And you said Daryl Hannah. . .

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,652
. . .was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,937
And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,893
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,334
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way. . .

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,016
. . .you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

73
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,492
Then that's when you started yelling.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,136
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

75
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,132
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,418
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

77
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,729
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

78
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,775
I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,495
Did I just share too much?

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,492
Just a smidge.

81
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,530
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,729
I think it's romantic.

83
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,015
Me too!

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,571
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

85
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,131
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,733
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,130
I just want to be
with him all the time.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,531
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,174
And special occasions.

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,332
I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,140
You'll break the pact.
She's breaking the pact.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,532
Yeah, could I just. . .?

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,450
Yeah, because I already asked Janice.

94
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,768
Come on, this was a pact!
This was your pact!

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,534
I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!

96
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,573
But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,254
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

98
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,057
Hi, sorry I'm late.

99
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,131
Too many jokes.

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,819
Must mock Joey.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,171
Nice shoes, huh?

102
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,732
God, you're killing me!

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,736
He's playing with my spatulas again!

104
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,374
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,451
Do you always have to bring him here?

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,652
I didn't want to leave him alone.

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,414
We had our first fight this morning.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,811
It has to do with my working late.

109
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,018
I said some things that I didn't mean.

110
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,935
He threw some feces.

111
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,256
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,931
That would be great!

113
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,133
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,940
. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.

115
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,092
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,810
But you can't actually
test this theory.

117
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,973
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,131
. . .to simulate these conditions.

119
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,251
All right. I have a question then.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,011
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
That's definitely a valid question. . .

122
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,256
. . .and the answer. . .

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,695
. . .would be yes.

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,969
Yes, I was.

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,531
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .

126
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,573
. . .that happened at this
phenomenal moment because it's you.

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,935
Sure.

128
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,928
Right. But the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

129
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,059
And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .

130
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,372
. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

131
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,134
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

132
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,254
Oh, David, I think you are
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''

133
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,532
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

134
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,979
-Really.
-I'm sure of it.

135
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,973
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

136
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,016
Now?

137
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,813
Right now. Just. . . .

138
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,734
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

139
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,897
And this was a gift.

140
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,813
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?

141
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,898
-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.

142
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,056
Tell me something, what does
''No-Date Pact'' mean to you?

143
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,373
I'm sorry. It's just that Chandler
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

144
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,497
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

145
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,691
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

146
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,534
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

147
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,333
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

148
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,573
Okay. Here we go.

149
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,736
There. Now there is.

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,212
So on our no-date evening, three
of you now are gonna have dates.

152
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,456
-Four.
-Four.

153
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,928
-Five.
-Five.

154
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,180
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

155
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,776
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

156
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,978
What's an elf to do?

157
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,812
So I'm gonna be the only one standing
there alone when the ball drops?

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,735
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

159
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,857
This is so not what I needed now.

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,010
What's the matter?

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,613
Oh, it's Marcel.

162
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,973
He keeps shutting me out.

163
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,735
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

164
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,218
That's weird. I had a blast
with him the other night.

165
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,331
-Really?
-We played. We watched TV.

166
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,969
That juggling thing is amazing.

167
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,731
What juggling thing?

168
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,292
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

169
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,535
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

170
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,255
And a melon.

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,650
-Phoebe! Hi!
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

172
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,618
No. Have you seen David?

173
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,453
No, he hasn't been around.

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,931
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,330
Minsk?

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,132
Minsk. It's in Russia.

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,096
I know where Minsk is.

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,535
We got the grant!

179
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,459
Three years, all expenses paid.

180
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,368
So when do you leave?

181
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,496
January 1 st.

182
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,532
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

183
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,977
So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!

184
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,691
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

185
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,894
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

186
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,850
Tell her, David.

187
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,332
''I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,014
I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''

189
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,572
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

190
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,572
So you're really not going?

191
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,857
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just. . . .

192
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,456
You decide.

193
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,135
-Don't do that.
-Please?

194
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,329
But I'm asking you.

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,979
I can't make a decision.

196
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,972
-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,499
-Stay.
-Stay.

198
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,938
Getting so good at that!

199
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,258
It was Max's stuff.

200
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,970
I love this artichoke thing.

201
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,576
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

202
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,139
You remember Janice.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,289
Vividly.

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,450
Hi, I'm Sandy.

205
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,816
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,336
You brought your kids.

207
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,252
Yeah. That's okay, right?

208
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,899
Party!

209
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,654
That thing is not coming in here!

210
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,131
''That thing''? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

211
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,009
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,492
Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

213
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,817
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

214
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,175
And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here. . .

215
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,419
. . .like nothing happened. . . .

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,452
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

217
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,895
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

218
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,655
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

219
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,054
All right. . .

220
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,931
. . .I'll catch up with you later.

221
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,892
Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .

222
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,698
. . .are you okay?

223
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,969
Where's Paolo?

224
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,609
Rome.

225
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,612
Jerk missed his flight.

226
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,573
And then your face exploded?

227
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,139
I was at the airport
getting into a cab. . .

228
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,659
. . .when this woman. . .

229
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,494
. . .this blond planet
with a pocketbook. . .

230
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,574
. . .starts yelling at me.

231
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,334
Something about how
it was her cab first.

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,414
The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

233
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,379
And I started blowing my attack
whistle thingy. . .

234
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,134
. . .and then three more cabs show up.

235
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,777
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

236
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,135
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

237
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,896
Everybody having fun at the party?

238
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,135
Are people eating my dip?

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,969
When I saw you at the store
last week. . .

240
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,818
. . .it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

241
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,851
Wow, that's dirty!

242
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,016
Hey, kids.

243
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,856
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me. . .

244
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,772
. . .but at least check in.

245
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,051
There you are!

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,060
You got away from me.

247
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,291
But you found me.

248
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,218
Here, Ross, take our picture.

249
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,696
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

250
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,138
Kill me. Kill me now.

251
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,732
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

252
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,935
Hey, sorry I'm late.

253
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
But my grandfather. . .

254
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,978
. . .died about two hours ago.

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,059
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .

256
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,774
. . .here I am.

257
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,415
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,334
Whoa! Who died?

259
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,373
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

260
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,218
So at least I'll get to see him again.

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,571
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

262
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,776
All right, Janice, that's it!

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,258
When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--

264
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,650
Oh, no!

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,855
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,336
You listen to me!
You listen to me!

267
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,131
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

268
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,851
Will you give me the thing?

269
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,176
Hi, Max.

270
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,655
Yoko.

271
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,697
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

272
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,132
It won't be the same. . .

273
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,932
. . .but it will still be Minsk.

274
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,698
Happy New Year.

275
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,539
Are you all right?

276
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,817
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

277
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,455
You're going to Minsk.

278
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,531
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

279
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,332
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

280
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,458
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

281
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,772
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,137
-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,572
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

284
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,412
That's what I have to do now. ''

285
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,413
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

286
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,575
And then you say,
''It's tearing me apart. . .

287
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,334
. . .but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

288
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,252
And I say, ''No!

289
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,139
No! I can't understand that! ''

290
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,170
Sorry.

291
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,380
And then you put
your arms around me. . . .

292
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,333
Put your arms around me.

293
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,695
Sorry.

294
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,290
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

295
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,535
I'll never forget you.

296
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,579
Then you say that it's almost
midnight and you have to go. . .

297
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,211
. . .because you don't want to start
the year with me if you can't finish it.

298
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,739
I'm gonna miss you. . .

299
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,852
. . .you scientist guy.

300
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,017
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

301
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,936
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

302
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,818
It gets better every year.

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,413
Here you go, kids.

304
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,934
And then the peacock bit me.

305
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,452
Please kiss me at midnight!

306
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,250
You seen Sandy?

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,775
I don't know how to tell you this. . .

308
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,808
. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
on with Max, that scientist geek.

309
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,529
Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

310
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,935
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

311
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,129
What?

312
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,891
The ball is dropping!

313
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,695
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

314
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,539
And the moment of joy is upon us.

315
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,938
Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.

316
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,729
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

317
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,135
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!

318
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,934
--four, three, two. . .

319
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,859
. . .one! Happy New Year!

320
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,658
I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz. . .

321
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,132
. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

322
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,773
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,738
I can't kiss anyone.

324
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,658
So I'm kissing everyone?

325
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,416
You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

326
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,059
Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

327
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,528
Somebody kiss me.

328
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,369
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

329
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,451
All right! All right! All right!

330
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,809
There!

331
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,568
I wanted this to work so much.

332
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,858
I'm still in there, you know?

333
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,012
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,735
But he's just phoning it in.

335
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,648
It's hard to accept
that something you love so much. . .

336
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,016
. . .doesn't love you back, you know?

337
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,738
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:05,030
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:08,422
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:13,220
Oh, my God! Don't look now.
Behind you there's a guy. . .

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,144
. . .who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,346
Where?

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,383
Come to Mama!

7
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,300
He's coming!
Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

8
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,707
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

9
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,779
-We should do something. Whistle.
-We're not whistling.

10
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:29,821
Come on, do it!

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,226
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,701
I can't believe you did that!

13
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:42,667
The One With Mrs. Bing

14
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,940

15
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,183
Why did I woo-hoo?

16
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:30,541
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say. . .

17
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,941
. . . ''I love that sound.
I must have you now''?

18
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:37,224
I just wish there was something
we could do.

19
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,860
Hello, coma guy.

20
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,542
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

21
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,940
What are you doing?

22
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,022
Maybe nobody's tried this.

23
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,020
I wish we at least knew his name.

24
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,823
Look at that face.

25
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,865
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

26
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,387
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

27
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:06,864
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

28
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,590
And he can dance!

29
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:13,429
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening. . .

30
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,269
. . .not saying, ''I understand'' . . .

31
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,025
. . .but really wondering
what you look like naked.

32
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:23,385
I wish all guys could be like him.

33
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:26,060
I know.

34
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,824
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

35
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,865
He doesn't have anyone.

36
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:38,147
We feel kind of responsible.

37
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:41,220
I can't believe you said, ''Woo-hoo! ''

38
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,264
I don't even say, ''Woo-hoo! ''

39
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,024
Oh, she's coming up!

40
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:49,742
When we come back, we'll talk with
the always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing!

41
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,947
Put the kids to bed for this one.

42
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:55,627
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO!

43
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,747
No way!

44
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,704
Come on! She's your mom!

45
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,748
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

46
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:03,585
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

47
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:08,668
I gotta tell you, I love
your mom's books! I love them!

48
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,471
I cannot get on a plane without one.
This is so cool!

49
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,020
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 1 1 . . .

50
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,190
. . .and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

51
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,907
I love your mom!
I think she's a blast!

52
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,903
You can say that.
She's not your mom.

53
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,425
Oh, please! She's the--

54
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,349
Hi, sweetie!

55
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,824
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

56
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,459
-Last night.
-Really?

57
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:36,828
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

58
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,868
Just a dream I had.

59
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,266
But. . . .

60
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,819
Hey, hey, hey! She's on!

61
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,310
Nora Bing!

62
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:53,063
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

63
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:54,989
Your mom was arrested?

64
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,102
I'm busy beaming with pride.

65
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,589
This is kind of embarrassing...

66
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:03,788
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

67
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,386
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

68
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,508
...I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

69
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,742
That's too much information!

70
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:19,070
So now you're doing this book tour.
How's that going?

71
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:23,145
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

72
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,461
But I get to see my son, who I love!

73
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:30,820
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

74
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,985
Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom somehow.

75
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,945
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom!

76
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,422
I bought my son his first condoms.

77
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,461
And then he burst into flames.

78
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,024
Let's see. ''Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

79
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,307
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

80
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,947
The high today was 45. ''

81
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,185
Teams played sports.

82
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,830
What about Glen?

83
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,306
He could be a Glen.

84
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,348
Not special enough.

85
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,663
How about Agamemnon?

86
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,510
Way too special.

87
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,226
I'm famished. What do I want?

88
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,543
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

89
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,504
You watched the show!
What did you think?

90
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,106
I think you need to come out
of your shell.

91
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,544
What is this dive?

92
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,027
Only you could've picked this place.

93
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,669
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

94
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,464
-I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

95
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,622
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

96
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,946
There you go. Ross?

97
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:24,905
I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

98
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,669
Hi! Sorry we're late.

99
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,267
We kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

100
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,262
But a man can change.

101
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,259
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

102
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,949
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've ever written.

103
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:59,230
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
all I wanted to do was become a writer.

104
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:02,144
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

105
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,627
Start with half a dozen
European cities. . .

106
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,425
. . .throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia. . .

107
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,946
. . .and you have got yourself a book!

108
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,665
My mother, ladies and gentlemen!

109
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,310
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

110
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,789
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

111
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,623
What is with you tonight?

112
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,345
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

113
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,430
Okay, thank you.

114
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:48,184
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

115
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,820
No. It's the one he's licking.

116
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,589
She's supposed to be with you.

117
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,580
You're good.

118
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:01,141
I have sold 100 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

119
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,423
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

120
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:11,101
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

121
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,148
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

122
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,428
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

123
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:19,668
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

124
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,028
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

125
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,465
When?

126
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,781
He's not a hero.

127
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,030
You know who our hero is?

128
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,779
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

129
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,830
No, it's you.

130
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,470
-Please.
-No, really.

131
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,986
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

132
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,269
-Right.
-Come on, kiddo.

133
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,230
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

134
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:06,942
I'll just pee in the street.

135
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,467
Is Chandler here?

136
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,265
Wait. Come here.

137
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,941
Okay, about last night. . .

138
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,021
. . .you know. . .

139
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,108
. . .Chandler, you didn't tell. . . .

140
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:31,549
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

141
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,543
Right. No big deal.

142
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,383
In Bizarro-world!

143
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:39,820
You broke the code!

144
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,829
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

145
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:46,427
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

146
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,940
But not a mom. Never a mom!

147
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,548
What are you guys doing out here?

148
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,227
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

149
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,543
But apparently somebody overslept.

150
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,268
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

151
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,071
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

152
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,347
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

153
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,424
Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

154
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:19,424
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

155
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,704
I'm scum. I'm scum.

156
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,260
-How could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

157
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,342
It's not like she's a regular mom.

158
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,229
She's sexy. She's. . . .

159
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,621
You don't think my mom's sexy?

160
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,305
Well, not in the same way.

161
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,430
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

162
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,021
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

163
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,749
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

164
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,265
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,463
Not playing racquetball.

166
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,550
-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

167
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,900
Sounds like you two have issues.

168
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:10,980
Goodbye, baby.

169
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,506
Do they wait for me to do this?

170
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:24,303
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

171
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,860
How about, because if you don't,
his mother might?

172
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,426
What are you guys doing here?

173
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,186
He's not even wearing a jock strap!

174
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,462
What did I ask?

175
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,869
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:59,063
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after. . .

177
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:00,460
. . .that I, you know.

178
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,429
So what are you doing here?

179
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,223
I'm not really here.

180
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:09,788
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

181
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,830
Do you come here a lot. . .

182
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:16,746
. . .without me?

183
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,027
No, no, no.

184
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:25,388
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

185
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,300
How would I know? I wasn't here.

186
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,827
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

187
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,467
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,350
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

189
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,189
I can't believe it.

190
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,425
Paolo kissed my mom?

191
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,823
I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

192
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,585
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk--

193
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,188
I can't do this. I did it.

194
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,746
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

195
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,181
What?

196
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:04,023
I was upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I had too much tequila, and Nora. . .

197
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,222
. . .Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was. . .

198
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,341
. . .just being nice.
But nothing happened.

199
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:11,660
Nothing. Ask Joey.

200
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:12,861
Joey came in--

201
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,829
You knew about this?

202
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,221
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

203
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,746
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:24,620
You're lucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

205
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,184
Thanks, man. Big help.

206
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,907
I can't believe this!
What were you thinking?

207
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,142
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

208
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,468
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

209
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,861
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this!

210
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:39,261
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you for not telling me.

211
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,150
-What are you mad at me--?
-Let me slam the door!

212
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:47,270
I didn't kiss her. He did. See
what happens when you break the code?

213
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:03,023
''A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Greene. ''

214
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,428
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

215
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:11,426
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be
''liberated from its denim prison''?

216
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,141
Yeah, I'd say so.

217
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,543
And there's no ''j'' in ''engorged. ''

218
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,866
Hey, Rach.

219
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,259
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

220
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,064
No. You?

221
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,580
You just asked me.

222
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,547
Maybe it was a trick question.

223
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,541
Rachel, can we do this now?

224
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,148
I am so hot!

225
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,623
Here's my mother and father
on their wedding day.

226
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,749
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

227
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,908
I cannot believe this conversation.

228
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,585
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

229
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:02,062
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

230
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,941
Thanks.

231
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:09,268
I'd like to start with a song
about a man I recently met. . .

232
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:12,628
. . .who's come to be
very important to me.

233
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,260
You don 't have to be awake
To be my man

234
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:29,146
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

235
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,661
Though we just met the other day

236
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:36,221
There's something I have got to say

237
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,149
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

238
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,861
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

239
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,625
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started--

240
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,227
I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

241
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,984
''Mother-kisser. ''

242
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll shut up.

243
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,220
Chandler, I know
you're still mad at me. . .

244
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:08,144
. . .but there were two people
there that night.

245
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,589
-There were two sets of lips.
-I expect this from her.

246
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,386
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

247
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,549
If she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

248
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,669
Because it's complicated.
It's complex!

249
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,310
Hey, you kissed my mom!

250
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,102
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

251
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,229
That's funny.
Are we done now?

252
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,503
You mean you're not gonna
tell her how you feel?

253
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:37,823
No. Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom. . .

254
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,068
. . .doesn't mean you know her.
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

255
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,506
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

256
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,190
Okay, that's my finger.

257
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,825
Okay, that's my knee.

258
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,464
Still doing the play.

259
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,224
What did you do with him?

260
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,063
-You're awake!
-Look at you!

261
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,222
How do you feel?

262
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,422
A little woozy, but basically okay.

263
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,428
Gosh, you look good!

264
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:13,990
I feel good.

265
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,584
Who are you?

266
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,350
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe Buffay.

267
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,059
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

268
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:22,141
We both have.

269
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,224
-The Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
-Actually, from me.

270
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:28,065
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

271
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,141
I read to you.

272
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:30,460
I sang.

273
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,950
Well, thanks.

274
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,307
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You're welcome.

275
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,309
So I guess I'll see you around.

276
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,183
What? That's it?

277
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,269
''See you around''?

278
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:47,469
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

279
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,939
Maybe. . .

280
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,419
. . . ''That was nice. ''

281
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,990
''It meant something to me. ''

282
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,590
''I'll call you. ''

283
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,981
-All right. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

284
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,863
This is so typical.

285
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,426
You know, we give. . .

286
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,859
. . .and we give. . .

287
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,624
. . .and we give.

288
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,867
And then we just get nothing back.

289
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:14,820
And then one day, it's just,
you wake up, and ''See you around. ''

290
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:18,390
Let's go, Phoebe.

291
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,621
You know what?
We thought you were different.

292
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:25,947
But I guess it was just the coma.

293
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:33,705
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

294
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:38,829
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

295
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:42,503
All right. Well, be good.
I love you.

296
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,024
You kissed my best Ross!

297
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,264
Or something to that effect.

298
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,988
Look, it was stupid.

299
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:02,307
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

300
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,820
And I don't even know how it happened.

301
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:10,581
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

302
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,229
Are we okay now?

303
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,665
No.

304
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:24,748
The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

305
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:29,508
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything!

306
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,661
You're kidding?

307
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,425
He said, ''When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?''

308
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,549
Then she came back with. . .

309
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:40,023
. . . ''The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?''

310
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,430
Are you sure she didn't say. . .

311
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:47,419
. . . ''When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?''

312
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,230
That makes more sense.

313
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,506
You think?

314
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,260
What's going on now?

315
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,068
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

316
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:03,863
I don't hear anything. Wait!

317
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,066
What do you see?

318
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,620
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

319
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,099
Wait, wait, wait!

320
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,303
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

321
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,221
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

322
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:19,740
Are you okay, kiddo?

323
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,066
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,029
All right. You be good.

325
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,829
Drive safe.

326
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,906
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

327
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:38,824
You mean that?

328
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,824
Yeah, why not?

329
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,180
So I told her.

330
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,262
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

331
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,103
Couldn't have gone worse.

332
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:51,663
Well, how do you feel?

333
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,787
Pretty good.

334
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,065
I told her.

335
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:58,063
Well, see?

336
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:02,429
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
me kissing your mom, huh?

337
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,906
But we don't have to
go down that road.

338
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,827
This is just the first chapter. . .

339
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:18,428
. . .and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

340
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,990
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts. ''

341
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,546
What's a ''niffle''?

342
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,589
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

343
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,747
All right, so I'm not a great typist.

344
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,825
Wait, did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

345
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,828
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those!

346
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:43,902
That's it. Give them back!

No, no, we're done!

The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

4
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:47,327
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

5
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:50,291
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna. . .

6
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,881
. . .I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

7
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,084
The meat's only every third layer.

8
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,890
Maybe you could scrape.

9
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,610
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

10
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:05,725
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass. . .

11
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,528
. . .and I could find my way
out like that!

12
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,007
This is cool.

13
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,608
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

14
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,083
And we're done with the yogurt.

15
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:21,808
Sorry.

16
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,723
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

17
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,566
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

18
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,082
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

19
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,404
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

20
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,525
Ross, listen.

21
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,605
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

22
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,968
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy. ''

23
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,448
Hello.

24
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,725
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,163
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

26
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,370
''What's a lesbian?''

27
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,490
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

28
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:10,122
It's like ''poke a nose. ''

29
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,884
Poke a nose.

30
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,491
So did I hear ''Poconos''?

31
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,962
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

32
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,480
First weekend away together.

33
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,922
-Yeah, it's a big step.
-I know.

34
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,365
It's just a weekend.
Big deal.

35
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,132
Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

36
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,885
Shouldn't it be. . .

37
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,885
. . .flung by now?

38
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,524
We are way past the ''fling'' thing.

39
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:48,481
I'm feeling things I've only
read about in Danielle Steel books.

40
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,690
When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally. . . .

41
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,492
Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

42
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,888
What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

43
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,450
I could call Immigration.

44
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:11,128
I love babies with
their little baby shoes. . .

45
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:15,166
. . .and their little baby toes
and their little hands. . . .

46
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,482
You're gonna have to stop that. . .

47
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,568
. . .forever.

48
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:29,885
Need a new table.

49
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,687
You think?

50
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,047
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,407
I brought the books. . .

52
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,287
. . .and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,887
Great!

54
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:50,290
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

55
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,482
I'm pretty sure that it is.

56
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,165
So I got the results
of the amnio today.

57
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,600
Tell me.
Is everything. . .?

58
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,165
Totally and completely healthy.

59
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,681
That's great! That is great!

60
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,486
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

61
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,688
That's our friend Tanya.

62
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,082
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

63
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,765
Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

64
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:31,766
The sex?

65
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:37,288
I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

66
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,807
But when you throw in Tanya. . . .

67
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,488
The sex of the baby, Ross.

68
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,041
You know it?

69
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,890
Do you want to know?

70
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,282
I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

71
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,205
I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there. . .

72
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,283
. . .and see,
''Oh, there it is. . . ''

73
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,291
. . .or isn't.

74
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,282
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,328
So?

76
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,366
So did you hear?

77
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,563
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-OK.

78
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh, that's so cool!

79
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,806
It really is.

80
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,287
Do we know?

81
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,285
We certainly do.
It's going to be a--

82
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,522
Hello?

83
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,366
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

84
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:30,324
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

85
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:38,245
What. . .?

86
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,920
What did we think it'd be?

87
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,687
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know.

88
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,729
I should probably just go.

89
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,288
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.

90
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,767
Susan.

91
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:03,204
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

92
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,088
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

93
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,524
So just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

94
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:17,568
That's the rule.

95
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,124
What rule?
There's no rule.

96
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,771
If anything, you owe me a table.

97
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:23,928
How did you get that?

98
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,009
This piece of furniture
was fine. . .

99
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,931
. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

100
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:30,807
You knew about that?

101
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:34,448
The impressions you made in the butter
left little to the imagination.

102
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,690
How about if we split it?

103
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,643
What do you mean,
like, buy it together?

104
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,690
Do you think we're ready for that?

105
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:45,888
Why not?

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,090
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

107
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,128
-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

108
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,646
You'd tell me if you were?

109
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:59,048
-It's just, with my last roommate--
-I know all about Kip.

110
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,289
We bought a hibachi together,
then he ran off and got married. . .

111
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:03,368
. . .and things got ugly.

112
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,283
Let me ask you something.

113
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,051
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

114
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:09,848
Don't do that.

115
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,649
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

116
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:22,009
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,130
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

118
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,481
Thanks.

119
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,646
Here comes your 3:00.

120
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,525
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but-- Yum!

121
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,291
Paolo! Hi!
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,608
Rachella tell me you. . .

123
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,162
. . .massage?

124
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,927
Well, Rachella's right.

125
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,963
I don't know what you said,
so let's start.

126
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,567
I am. . .

127
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,449
. . .being naked?

128
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:04,960
That's your decision.

129
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,367
Some people prefer to take off--

130
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,521
Being naked!

131
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,924
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I couldn't not know.

132
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,642
If the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--

133
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,722
And Monica knows.

134
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,091
How could you?
I don't even know.

135
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,129
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.

136
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,885
I asked. She told me.

137
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,605
So what's it going to be?

138
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:33,450
Great! Now he knows
and I don't know.

139
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:35,882
I'm sorry. I'm excited
about being an aunt.

140
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,281
Or an uncle.

141
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:45,688
Fine!

142
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:49,802
What's the matter?

143
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,890
Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

144
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,123
Can we get some
cappuccino over here?

145
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,284
Oh, right! That's me!

146
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,730
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

147
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,087
Fine.

148
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,887
What is it?

149
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:09,408
You know Paolo?

150
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,921
I'm familiar with his work.

151
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,406
He made a move on me.

152
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:17,561
-The store'll be open tomorrow.
-More coffee.

153
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:26,206
What happened?

154
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,124
He came in for a massage. . .

155
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:30,283
...and everything was fine until....

156
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:35,288
My God!

157
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:36,601
Are you sure?

158
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,881
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

159
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:47,281
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

160
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,128
Was it. . .?

161
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,886
Boy Scouts could've
camped under there.

162
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:58,411
''Ooh,'' what?

163
00:10:58,652 --> 00:10:59,687
--ma Thurman.

164
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,883
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

165
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:04,048
Thanks, Rach.

166
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,850
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

167
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,481
You have to! It's your
moral obligation as a friend. . .

168
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,324
. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.

169
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,085
Guys? Guys?

170
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,004
You have to tell her.

171
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,571
Feminist issue?
That's where I went.

172
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,726
She is gonna hate me!

173
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,528
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

174
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,046
Here, how about that one?

175
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,683
That's patio furniture.

176
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:37,968
So what?

177
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,448
Like people will come in and think,
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''

178
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,687
Fine.

179
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,890
What about the birds?

180
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,731
I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .

181
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,611
. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''

182
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,085
You pick one.

183
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,606
How about the ladybugs?

184
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:58,811
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

185
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,162
Fine! Do you want the birds?
Get the birds!

186
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,090
Not like that, I won't.

187
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,520
Kip would've liked the birds.

188
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:19,728
Hi, Pheebs.

189
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,082
Are you moving out?

190
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,288
No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

191
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:24,885
This one's Paolo's.

192
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,284
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

193
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:32,368
Sure.

194
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,881
Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.

195
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:49,803
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

196
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,968
There are three things
you should know about me.

197
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,404
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

198
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,490
Two, I never lie.

199
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,807
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

200
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,208
Thanks, Pheebs.

201
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,765
My God!

202
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,008
Why have I never tasted these before?

203
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:21,921
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

204
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,730
You're right. These are
the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

205
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,411
Which proves that I never lie.

206
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,330
I guess you don't.

207
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,171
Paolo made a pass at me.

208
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,691
So what do you think?

209
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,287
It's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

210
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,362
I know.

211
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,730
So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?

212
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,451
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.

213
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:51,448
Come on!

214
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:54,727
Heads up, Ross.

215
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:56,202
Score!

216
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,601
You suck!

217
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,880
Are you okay?

218
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,081
I need some milk.

219
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:09,726
I've got milk.

220
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:15,888
Here you go.

221
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:24,968
Better?

222
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,086
I feel so stupid!

223
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,728
I think about the other day
with you guys.

224
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:39,328
And I was all,
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

225
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,085
He makes me feel so--''

226
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,087
God!

227
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,205
I'm so embarrassed!

228
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,646
I'm the one he hit on.

230
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,410
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.

231
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,330
If I had never met him,
this would never--

232
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,568
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

233
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,202
Wait!

234
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,688
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

235
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,843
Right. He's the pig.

236
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,691
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

237
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:08,202
He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .

238
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:10,647
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

239
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,211
But he was my pig man!

240
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,922
How did I not see this?

241
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,527
Oh, I know!

242
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,766
Because. . .

243
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,925
. . .he's gorgeous.

244
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,685
And he's charming.

245
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,400
And the way he looks at you--

246
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,522
The end.

247
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,282
God!

248
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,288
Should I not have told you?

249
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,249
Trust me, it's much better
that I know.

250
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,166
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

251
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,446
I think she took it pretty well.

252
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,043
Paolo's over there right now, so. . . .

253
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,083
We should go
and see if she's okay.

254
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,482
Just one second.

255
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,608
Score!

256
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,165
Game! Us!

257
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:25,122
Come on.

258
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,770
It looks like
we kicked your butts.

259
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:30,927
She kicked our butts.

260
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,845
You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

261
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,367
Come on. Two on one.

262
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:38,086
Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.

263
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,645
It's time for you to swoop in.

264
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:41,888
What, now?

265
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,121
Now is when you swoop.

266
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:47,682
When Paolo walks out of there,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

267
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,282
She's got to know
you're everything he's not.

268
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,488
You're like the anti-Paolo.

269
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,044
My Catholic friend is right.

270
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,483
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

271
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,724
You pick up the pieces, and then
you usher in. . .

272
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,691
. . . ''The Age of Ross. ''

273
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:13,805
Hold it! Ascolta!

274
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,649
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

275
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,207
She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

276
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,528
Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.

277
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:27,248
That is either, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts! ''

278
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:29,928
Here he comes.

279
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,080
I am. . .

280
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,091
. . .to say goodbye.

281
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,081
Okay, bye-bye.

282
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,564
I hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

283
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,490
But I still have five of these. . .

284
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,121
. . .so heat it at 375
untiI the cheese bubbles.

285
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,291
I just wanna tell you. . .

286
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,922
. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .

287
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,891
Just look at her.

288
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,885
Guys, I think only one of us
should go out there. . .

289
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,923
-. . .so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

290
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,088
And I really think it should be me.

291
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,048
You all right?

292
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,290
I've been better.

293
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:48,201
Come here.

294
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,048
Listen. . .

295
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:59,684
. . .you deserve
so much better than him.

296
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,808
I mean, you. . .

297
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,682
. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

298
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,528
What?

299
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,086
I'm so sick of guys!

300
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,808
I don't want to look
at another guy.

301
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,088
I don't want to think
about another guy.

302
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,290
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

303
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,483
Ross, you're so great.

304
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,371
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

305
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,491
Medium.

306
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,684
Any cookies left?

307
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:52,887
See, Rach. . .

308
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,370
. . .I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

309
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:02,043
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

310
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,092
I just need to be
by myself for a while.

311
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,004
I just gotta
figure out what I want.

312
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:14,565
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

313
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:16,490
No, I know. I know.

314
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:20,480
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

315
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,088
What?

316
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,168
What?

317
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,401
I'm having a boy?

318
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,925
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

319
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,084
I'm having a boy.

320
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,601
Am I having a boy?

321
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,283
You're having a boy!

322
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,926
I'm having a boy!

323
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,127
I'm having a boy!

324
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,128
-What?
-What is it?

325
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,367
I'm having a boy!

326
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:52,930
We already knew that!

327
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,685
I'm having a son.

328
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,610
And that would be a shutdown!

329
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,006
Shutout!

330
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,766
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game!

331
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,883
It's 2:30 in the morning.

332
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:19,087
Get out!

333
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,325
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

334
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,927
Come on, I'll only use
my left hand.

335
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,128
Come on, wussies!

336
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,888
All right! Okay!
I gotta go!

337
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,487
I'm going.

338
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:36,285
And I'm gone.

339
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:39,888
One more game?

You just barge in here

You have no respect
for my privacy?

00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,372
. . .tell them the story about
your patient. . .

13
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,773
. . .who thinks things are
other things.

14
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,016
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower. . . .

15
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,376
That's pretty much it.

16
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,013
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

17
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:43,168
Thanks.

18
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,972
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,811
Okay. I'll miss you.

20
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,814
Isn't he great?

21
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,288
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

22
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,408
I know. I know.

23
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,491
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

24
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,810
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky. You know?

25
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,935
Think you'll do it on his couch?

26
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,817
I don't know. That's a little weird.

27
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:08,377
It's vinyl. . . .

28
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,091
You guys want anything else?

29
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,771
-Could I have--
-We're all out.

30
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,206
Anybody else?

31
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,890
Did I miss something?

32
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,170
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

33
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,771
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

34
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:27,814
It was an accident.

35
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,977
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,369
Can we change the subject, please?

37
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,567
Because, hello? These aren't her
''boobies. '' These are her breasts.

38
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,016
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

39
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:47,408
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

40
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,773
''Nice''?

41
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,213
They were ''nice''?

42
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,097
That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice. ''

43
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,369
Rock, hard place. . .

44
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,374
. . .me.

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,007
You're so funny!

46
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,175
He's really funny!

47
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:13,133
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

48
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,257
Back up there, sparky.

49
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,652
What did you mean by that?

50
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,610
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues. . .

51
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,493
. . .that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

52
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,657
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

53
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,453
Only child, right?

54
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,008
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

55
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:41,574
How did you know?

56
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,327
It's textbook.

57
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,447
Hey, you guys.

58
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,177
You all know my dad, right?

59
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,974
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.

60
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:53,213
I got a job midtown.

61
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,608
I'm better off
staying with the kid. . .

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,968
. . .than going back and forth
on the ferry.

63
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,253
I don't know this one.

64
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,535
This is my friend Roger.

65
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,296
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

66
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:06,211
What happened to the puppet guy?

67
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,214
Dad!

68
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:09,773
Excuse me.

69
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,969
So, Ross, how's the wife?

70
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,771
0 for 2, huh?

71
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,574
Chandler, quick,
say something funny!

72
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,777
Gotta go.

73
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,973
I miss you too.

74
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:32,209
I love you,
but it's getting late now--

75
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,016
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma!

76
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:37,773
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

77
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:39,967
Excuse me?

78
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,817
Did you know this isn't Ma?

79
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,608
Her name's Ronni.

80
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,657
She's a pet mortician.

81
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,773
Sure.

82
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,769
So how long have you been. . . .

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:12,096
Remember when you were a kid, we'd
go see the big ships in the navy yard?

84
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,248
Since then?

85
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,974
No, it's only been six years.

86
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,770
I wanted to give you
a nice memory. . .

87
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,090
. . .so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

88
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,888
Joe, have you ever been in love?

89
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:28,528
I don't know.

90
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,577
Then you haven't.

91
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,611
You're burning your tomatoes.

92
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,007
You're one to talk.

93
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,369
Your dad's in love, bigtime.

94
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,251
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

95
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,410
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

96
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,456
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

97
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,297
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out. . .

98
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,534
. . .your dad was
leading this double life.

99
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:04,572
He's like actually some spy
working for the CIA.

100
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,406
That'd be cool!

101
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,571
This blows!

102
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,490
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

103
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,569
Why do they
have to become people?

104
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,649
Why do they have--

105
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,173
Why. . .

106
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,409
. . .can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

107
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,767
What?

108
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,173
What?

109
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,612
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

110
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,177
We're all adults here.

111
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,051
There's only one way
to resolve this.

112
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,737
Since you saw her boobies. . .

113
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:42,372
. . .you're gonna have to show her
your pee-pee.

114
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,767
You know,
I don't see that happening.

115
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,168
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

116
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,247
Well I'm not showing you my tat!

117
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:10,567
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

118
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:12,893
Come on up.

119
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,976
Oh, good! Rog is here!

120
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,215
-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,176
I hate that guy!

122
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,288
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

123
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,335
Come on, he's not that bad.

124
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,211
That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her. . .

125
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,137
. . .if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

126
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,372
I don't know.

127
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,256
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

128
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,369
Why? Why would I?
Why?

129
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,012
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

130
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,574
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.

131
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,973
Wait!
Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

132
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,778
Well, I don't know.

133
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,015
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage. . .

134
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,728
. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

135
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:15,047
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

136
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,292
-So you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

137
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,653
That's not what I was saying.

138
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,814
I thought you were on my side. . .

139
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,288
. . .but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .

140
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,567
. . .so they'd favor you.

141
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:32,087
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

142
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:37,973
You're right.

143
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,571
I mean, you're right!

144
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,407
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace. . .

145
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,174
. . .and the Weeble's Cruise Ship. . .

146
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,172
. . .which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

147
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,090
That's tough, tough stuff.

148
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,575
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

149
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,373
Feel better, okay?

150
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,375
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

151
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,216
Thanks for everything, Mon.

152
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,288
No problem.

153
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,330
It was great seeing you again.

154
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:12,691
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

155
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,974
Remember, they're just food. . .

156
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,537
. . .they're not love.

157
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,371
I hate that guy!

158
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,132
Good night, you guys.

159
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,572
Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.

160
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,727
Can we help you?

161
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,086
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

162
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:44,891
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

163
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,571
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

164
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:49,767
Oh, my God!

165
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,538
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

166
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,530
I'm Ronni.

167
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,607
Cheese nip?

168
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:04,969
Joey's having an embolism. . .

169
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,772
. . .but I'd go for a nip.

170
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,493
Most people,
when their pets pass on. . .

171
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,298
. . .want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

172
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,535
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

173
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,378
Like chasing their tail.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,209
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

175
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:33,575
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

176
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,851
That's a good one!

177
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,537
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

178
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,017
Hello, babe!

179
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,053
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,891
You left your hair
at my place.

181
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,413
I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.

182
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,134
Thank you.

183
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,533
So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

184
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:04,887
Look, I. . . .

185
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,691
I shouldn't have come.

186
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,247
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

187
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,449
I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

188
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,376
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?

189
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,532
We'll go to a hotel.

190
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,767
We'll go to a hotel.

191
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,169
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

192
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,177
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

193
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:28,211
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

194
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,010
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

195
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,014
Right, mister!

196
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,818
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .

197
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,367
. . .you're gonna live by my rules.

198
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,611
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

199
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,772
Wow, he's strict.

200
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,407
Dad, you'll be in my room.

201
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,536
Ronni, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

202
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,048
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

203
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,214
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

204
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,572
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''

205
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,894
This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

206
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:10,527
-Six years is long enough!
-What kind of change?

207
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,655
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,412
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

209
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,532
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

210
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,571
Hey, kickie!

211
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,008
What are you doing?

212
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,577
Trying to get comfortable.

213
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,571
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

214
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,366
I've been thinking. . .

215
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,769
. . .about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls. . . .

216
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,769
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

217
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,216
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

218
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,177
I always figured, when
the right one comes along. . .

219
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,575
. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.

220
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:11,087
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--

221
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,607
You're not him, you're you.

222
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,167
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

223
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:21,847
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

224
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,013
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

225
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:29,491
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along. . .

226
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:31,529
. . .you'll have the guts to say:

227
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,091
''No thanks, I'm married. ''

228
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,767
You really think so?

229
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,007
I really do.

230
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:44,771
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

231
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,174
May I help you?

232
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:03,333
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

233
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:05,974
Who are you?

234
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,372
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

235
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,494
The mistress?

236
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,216
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

237
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,295
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

238
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:18,408
Say, Ronni. . . .

239
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,774
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

240
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,697
Like five minutes.

241
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:24,973
Perfect.

242
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,611
Fasten your seat belts. . .

243
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,376
. . .it's pee-pee time!

244
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,366
Hey, Mr. Trib.

245
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,212
Good morning, dear.

246
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:44,766
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

247
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:59,329
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

248
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:03,088
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing!

249
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,377
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

250
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:16,774
How's it going?

251
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:17,894
Good.

252
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:22,291
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:26,454
What's going on?

254
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:27,767
Nothing.

255
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:29,567
It's just that. . . .

256
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:31,568
It's Roger.

257
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,452
There's something about--

258
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:36,810
Basically, we just feel
that he's. . . .

259
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:38,047
We hate that guy!

260
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,453
We hate him!

261
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,137
We're sorry, Pheebs.

262
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,015
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive. . .

263
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,816
. . .that it freaked you out?

264
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,736
-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!

265
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,053
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,410
Ma! What are you doing here?

267
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,574
I came to give you this. . .

268
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:09,012
. . .and this!

269
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,657
Big ring!

270
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,811
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

271
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,572
. . .about making things right?

272
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,968
Things were fine the way they were!

273
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,778
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

274
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:24,777
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.

275
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,616
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:31,093
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

277
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,613
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,610
You should have heard
his cover stories.

279
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,008
''I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's. ''

280
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,408
I mean, what is that?
Please!

281
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,410
So then, how could you--?

282
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,007
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

283
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:49,297
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

284
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:53,087
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,771
Now he's happy.

286
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,486
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

287
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,175
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but. . .

288
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:05,011
. . .what the hell
are you saying?

289
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,491
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

290
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:11,412
Look, honey. . .

291
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,769
. . .in an ideal world. . .

292
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:17,095
. . .there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

293
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,970
And I'll tell you something else:

294
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,409
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along. . .

295
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:28,776
. . .he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

296
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,775
He's been more loving.

297
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,408
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

298
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,929
I'm happy for you. . .?

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,287
Well, don't be!

300
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,095
Because now everything's screwed up.

301
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,611
I just want it the way it was.

302
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,611
Ma, I'm sorry.

303
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,168
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

304
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,172
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

305
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,371
So tell me. . . .

306
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:02,767
Did you see her?

307
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,692
You're ten times prettier
than she is.

308
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,172
That's sweet.

309
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,132
Could I take her?

310
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,974
With this ring, no contest!

311
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,128
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing. . . .

312
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,776
What's wrong? Come on.

313
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,130
It's nothing. I'm fine.

314
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,215
It's just--
It's my friends.

315
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,018
They have a liking problem with you. . .

316
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,407
. . .in that. . .

317
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,977
. . .they don't.

318
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,573
They don't?

319
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:46,772
But you know. . .

320
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:49,691
. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

321
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:53,294
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

322
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,017
They think you're a little. . . .

323
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:56,734
What?

324
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,087
Intense and creepy.

325
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,606
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

326
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,888
I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

327
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,407
You're not?
That's why you're so great.

328
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,814
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .

329
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,051
. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

330
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,772
You know, this kind of codependent. . .

331
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,576
. . .emotionally stunted. . .

332
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:27,773
. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups. . .

333
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:31,215
. . .which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

334
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:36,896
And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

335
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,771
Love me! I need love! ''

336
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:42,776
So you talked to your dad?

337
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,890
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

338
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,612
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know.

339
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:51,497
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore. . .

340
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,694
. . .because he got
a restraining order.

341
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:57,968
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

342
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,606
Things have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

343
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:04,813
So Joey, are you okay?

344
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,487
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,888
It's just--
You know, they're parents.

346
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,971
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

347
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,777
Even if you know better. . .

348
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,367
. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

349
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:17,567
And just think. . .

350
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,814
. . .in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

351
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,377
Oh, please!

352
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,576
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .

353
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:27,212
. . .chasing after 20-year-old boys. . .

354
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,176
. . .or I'll end up like my mom!

355
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:36,566
How's it going?

356
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,933
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

357
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:42,888
Yeah, right!

358
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,614
What happened?

359
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:50,373
I don't know. I mean. . . .

360
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,011
He's a good person. . .

361
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:54,055
. . .and he can be really sweet.

362
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:57,411
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

363
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:58,613
It's just. . . .

364
00:20:58,858 --> 00:20:59,973
I hate that guy!

365
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,613
What's going on?

366
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,372
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

367
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,336
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

368
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,693
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

369
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:26,373
Sorry, wrong boobies!

370
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:40,127
Hello, Joey!

371
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,767
Hello, dear!

00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:05,372
I'm teIIing you, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,255
She bareIy knows me.
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:09,292
Any contact?

4
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:10,724
She lent me an egg once.

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,085
You're in!

6
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:14,615
Oh, right.

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,976
Come on. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:29,175
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you. . . .

9
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,893
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,208
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
still in the shell?

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,412
An egg?

12
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:41,332
Go up to her and say, ''Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. ''

13
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,454
I think it's winning!

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,371
I think it's insane.

15
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:46,412
She'll love it!

16
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

17
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:55,293
Go with the egg, my friend.

18
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,891
Go, go, go!

19
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,933
-Think it'll work?
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

20
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,532
The One With the Candy Hearts

22
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,607
-You cannot do this.
-What? Do what?

23
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,335
Roger wants to take her out.

24
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,448
No! Pheebs! Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

25
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,529
Because he was creepy.

26
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,327
And mean. And a little frightening.

27
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,010
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

28
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,890
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

29
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,764
I know I do.

30
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,734
What are you doing tomorrow night?

31
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,734
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

32
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,366
-Listen, about tonight--
-Don't you dare bail on me!

33
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:29,926
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

34
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,933
But her friend sounds like such a--

35
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,292
Pathetic mess. I know, but. . . .

36
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,330
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable.

37
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,128
I'm thinking. . . .

38
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,646
Thanks.

39
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:49,211
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

40
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,325
She said yes.

41
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,654
Way to go, man!

42
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,927
Still got the egg, huh?

43
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:12,885
How do I look?

44
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,535
I don't care.

45
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,451
There's Lorraine.

46
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:22,368
Now, remember, no trading.

47
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,811
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

48
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,095
Well, well!

49
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,854
Look what you brought!

50
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,495
Very nice.

51
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,367
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,654
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,047
I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:47,925
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,446
Janice?

56
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,165
Oh. . .

57
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,565
. . .my. . .

58
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:01,965
. . .God!

59
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,408
Hey, it's Janice!

60
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm making a break for it!
I'm going out the window!

61
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:20,933
No, don't, please! I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine!

62
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,252
-Just calm down.
-Calm down? Calm down?

63
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,330
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months!

64
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,966
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous. . .

65
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,332
. . .and I can't go when I'm nervous.

66
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,733
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

68
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:51,925
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

69
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,973
-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?

70
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:57,731
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

71
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,605
''Oh, was it good for you?''

72
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:06,729
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

73
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,927
''I win! I win! ''

74
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,527
I went out with him for
two months. I didn't get to win once!

75
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:17,367
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

76
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,335
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

77
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,932
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

78
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:28,613
There's more beer, right?

79
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:33,653
Oh! You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

80
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,770
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle. . .

81
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,211
. . .you can do a cleansing ritual.

82
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,286
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

83
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,130
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

84
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,128
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

85
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,652
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

86
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:00,775
Okay, we can burn the stuff
they gave us.

87
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,215
Or. . .?

88
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:08,052
Or we can chant and dance
around naked, you know, with sticks.

89
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,205
Burning's good.

90
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,935
I've got stuff to burn.

91
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,012
You know. . .

92
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,048
. . .ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

93
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,206
Yeah?

94
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:30,810
Good for you.

95
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,609
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

96
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:45,525
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

97
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,086
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

98
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,004
That's okay.

99
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:56,246
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

100
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,852
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

101
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:03,935
We can't do that!

102
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,052
What? What can't you do?

103
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,292
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

104
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:21,174
We might be leaving now.

105
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,854
Say it's you and me ''we. ''

106
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,130
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

107
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,936
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

108
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:34,930
But I definitely want to be
a part of it!

109
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

110
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:42,411
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

111
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,734
Can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

112
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,815
I'm out of here.

113
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:53,733
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,446
I hope she throws up on you.

115
00:07:58,816 --> 00:07:59,805
Thanks.

116
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:02,846
So. . . .

117
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,695
Just us.

118
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:07,246
What a crappy night!

119
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,535
Though I've enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out. . .

120
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,495
. . .of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

121
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:20,525
Excuse me.

122
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,124
How you doing?

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,612
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

124
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,086
Joey's not a friend. He's. . .

125
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,127
. . .a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

126
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:46,052
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

127
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,809
I will go for that drink.

128
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,535
You got it. Good woman!

129
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,131
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

130
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,007
Each.

131
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:59,530
That's right. Each.

132
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,010
And a rob roy.

133
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,734
I've always wanted to know.

134
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,811
Happy Valentine's Day!

135
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,295
Oh, I miss you already.

136
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,254
Can you believe this happened?

137
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,895
No, no!

138
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,695
And yet it did.

139
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,726
-Goodbye, Janice.
-Kiss me!

140
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:49,770
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

141
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,171
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

142
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,171
Hey, Janice.

143
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,326
Hi, Monica.

144
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,334
Okay. Well, this was very special.

145
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,294
Rach, come see who's out here!

146
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,529
What's going on--?
Oh, my God!

147
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,806
Janice! Hi!

148
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,856
Janice is gonna go away now!

149
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:15,731
I'll be right back.

150
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,772
Joey! Look who it is!

151
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,255
Oh, good! Joey's home now!

152
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:27,726
This is so much fun!

153
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,854
This is like a reunion in the hall!

154
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,854
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

155
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,410
He just happened to call.

156
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:43,934
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right!
It's me! How did you know?

157
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,365
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then. . .

158
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:57,734
. . .because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing. . .

159
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:01,127
. . .that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles. . .

160
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:05,329
. . .he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half!

161
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:09,691
That's funny!

162
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:27,845
Who are they?

163
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,246
The blond is my ex-wife.

164
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:33,408
And the woman touching her is her. . .

165
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,727
. . .close personal friend.

166
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,854
You mean they're lovers?

167
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,087
If you want to put a label on it.

168
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,214
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

169
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:51,926
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

170
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,727
I always forget that part.

171
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:00,805
Hello!

172
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:11,806
Okay. So now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

173
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,011
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

174
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:17,971
That's okay!

175
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:26,047
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

176
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:35,848
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

177
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,327
Can we start throwing things in?

178
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,804
Yeah, okay!

179
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,849
Okay. Barry's letters.

180
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,730
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

181
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:53,855
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with--

182
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,967
-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
-Let me see!

183
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,008
He's wearing a sweater.

184
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,045
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

185
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,695
Wait! Isn't it almost pure--

186
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,455
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

187
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,527
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

188
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,325
Oh, man! In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

189
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,485
Hello, funny valentine!

190
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,134
Hi, just Janice.

191
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,451
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

192
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,132
I could just kiss you all over
and I'm gonna!

193
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,814
If you don't do it, I will.

194
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:06,208
So what do you do for a living?

195
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,010
Well, for the past few years,
I've been. . . .

196
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,776
You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

197
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,931
I thought they could!

198
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,327
--working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

199
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:19,648
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

200
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:23,047
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science. . .

201
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,891
. . .which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

202
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,334
Now, that is funny!

203
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,685
Hey, do you think--

204
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,725
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

205
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,967
Because she's alone now.

206
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,214
And pregnant. And sad.

207
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,735
-I guess.
-Are you sure?

208
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,329
Thanks. Carol!

209
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,729
Wanna come over and join us?

210
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,130
Oh, no. I'm fine.

211
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:04,334
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down.

212
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,608
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

213
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,734
Let's try scooching! Come on!

214
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,972
-Come on.
-Thank you.

215
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,974
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

216
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,126
Carol, Kristen.

217
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,928
How do you do?

218
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,973
Carol teaches sixth grade.

219
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,606
And Kristen. . . .

220
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:31,046
Kristen does something. . .

221
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,174
. . .that, funnily enough. . .

222
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,335
. . .wasn't even her major!

223
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:42,895
What do we got there?

224
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,007
A piece of silk boxer shorts. . .

225
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,174
. . .some greeting cards. . .

226
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:51,694
. . .what looks like a
half-charred picture of. . . .

227
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,725
Wow! That guy's hairier
than the chief!

228
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:01,413
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

229
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,328
It's all right. Don't explain.

230
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,528
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
to get out of control.

231
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,331
-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?

232
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,534
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year!

233
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,375
I brought you something.

234
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,009
Is it loaded?

235
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,046
Oh, little candy hearts!

236
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,930
''Chan and Jan forever! ''

237
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,372
I had them made special.

238
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,210
Okay, Janice.

239
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,251
Janice.

240
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:42,885
Hey, Janice.

241
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,132
There's no way for me
to tell you this.

242
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:50,810
At least, no new way
for me to tell you this.

243
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,489
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

244
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,245
That's fine.

245
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,529
It is?

246
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,212
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

247
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,571
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

248
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,535
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

249
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,175
Don't you know it yet?

250
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,453
You love me, Chandler Bing!

251
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:27,009
Oh, no, I don't.

252
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:30,375
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

253
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,368
New Year's, who invited who?

254
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:35,369
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

255
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:36,446
I did, but--

256
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:37,924
You seek me out!

257
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:43,091
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

258
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,045
Janice! Janice!

259
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,531
You want me! You need me!

260
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:52,853
You can't live without me!

261
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,655
And you know it!

262
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:58,725
You just don't know you know it.

263
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,011
See you.

264
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,845
Call me!

265
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:23,930
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

266
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,570
You did so. I swear.
I swear to--

267
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,611
How long has she been in the bathroom?

268
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:36,533
I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

269
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,767
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

270
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:44,133
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

271
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,765
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

272
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,325
You know, this is still pretty hot.

273
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,931
Mushroom.

274
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,371
Smile.

275
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:03,130
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

276
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,496
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just. . . .

277
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:10,572
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

278
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,772
Well, do I have to?

279
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:17,846
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman. . .

280
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,052
. . .and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

281
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,093
But there's. . . .

282
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,405
That's it.

283
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:30,126
And then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

284
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,731
And I don't have to. . . .

285
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,649
-I know.
-You know?

286
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,527
Here's a wacky thought.

287
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,728
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

288
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,806
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

289
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:54,532
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

290
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,165
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

291
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,169
Because we're great together,
you know?

292
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,372
You can't deny it.

293
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,651
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

294
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,535
I mean, how perfect is that?

295
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,734
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

296
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:12,732
I love you.

297
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,368
I love you too.

298
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,574
-But--
-No ''but. '' No ''but. ''

299
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,533
You know that thing they
put over here with the pin in it?

300
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,804
It's time to take the pin out.

301
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:45,770
You'll find someone, I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

302
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,735
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

303
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:53,889
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

304
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,125
Not her.

305
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,729
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

306
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:17,130
So will you bring the truck?

307
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,527
I'll even let you ring the bell.

308
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,929
-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

309
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,774
Thanks. See you.

310
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,210
Oh, my God!

311
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,934
See, there you go.

312
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,451
-The cleansing worked.
-You're right!

313
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,095
They're nice guys!

314
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,612
They're firemen guys!

315
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,768
-You tell them you're married?
-No way!

316
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,735
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them!

-Cappuccino.

Thank you.

Rach?

Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,340
That's why.

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,694
Sorry.

Miss Tedlock, you're looking
lovely today.

May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

14
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:35,694
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

15
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,970
If this is about those prank memos,
I had nothing to do with them.

16
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,018
Nothing at all. Really.

17
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,337
Nothing.

18
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,454
Hey, you guys! You guys!

19
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:51,374
Chandler's coming and he says
he has incredible news.

20
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,931
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know--

21
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,340
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

22
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,574
What's going on?

23
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,381
So it's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers. . .

24
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:08,331
. . .and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

25
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,572
-That is great!
-Congratulations!

26
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,856
So. . .

27
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,937
. . .I quit.

28
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,740
Why?

29
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,977
Why? This was supposed to be
a temp job.

30
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,940
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,174
I know, but if I took it, it would
be admitting that this is what I do.

32
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,570
Was it a lot more money?

33
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,734
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office. . .

34
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,533
. . .worrying about the WENUS.

35
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,175
''The WENUS?''

36
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,056
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

37
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,578
Oh, that WENUS.

38
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,136
What are you gonna do?

39
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,377
I don't know. That's the thing.

40
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,617
But I won't figure it out
working there.

41
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,977
I have something you can do!

42
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,291
I have this new massage client, Steve.

43
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,541
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant. . .

44
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,136
. . .and he's looking for a head chef.

45
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,850
Hi, there.

46
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,057
I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

47
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:13,134
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so. . . .

48
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,894
I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

49
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,053
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

50
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,018
What kind of food
is he looking for?

51
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,940
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone. . .

52
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,137
. . .who can create the entire menu.

53
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,933
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, I know!

54
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,819
So what do you think?

55
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,458
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big white hat.

56
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,054
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

57
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,097
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

58
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,733
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

59
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,534
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

60
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:07,332
I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,694
I added the ''a-go-go. ''

62
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,170
Career counselor?

63
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,174
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

64
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,649
I don't.

65
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,737
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

66
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,137
You know, you have goals,
you have dreams.

67
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,530
I don't have a dream!

68
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,932
The lesser known
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

69
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,255
Oh, I love my life! I love my life!

70
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,934
Brian 's Song!

71
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,129
The meeting went great?

72
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,054
So great! He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

73
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,178
It's this cute little place on 1 0th.

74
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,094
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

75
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:49,532
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

76
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,657
Anyway, I'm cooking for him
Monday night. Kind of an audition.

77
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,779
He wants you to be here,
which will be great for me.

78
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,295
You can make yummy noises.

79
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:00,612
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

80
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,772
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

81
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,376
I don't know.
It's just got to be great.

82
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,771
I know what you can make!
I know!

83
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,694
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

84
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,257
You know. . .

85
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,492
. . .that thing with the stuff?

86
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,375
Okay, I don't know.

87
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,530
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

88
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:29,493
How about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

89
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,332
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

90
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,932
-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug lady?

91
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,218
I love you, Ross.

92
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,859
Her name's Celia.
She's not a bug lady.

93
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,376
She's curator of insects
at the museum.

94
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,090
What are you gonna do?

95
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:55,732
I thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place. . .

96
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:58,330
. . .and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

97
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,538
He's not speaking metaphorically.

98
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,375
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe. . . .

99
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,973
Well, I don't know. . . .

100
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,295
I'm hoping. . . .

101
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,137
I tell you, that monkey's
a chick magnet.

102
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:24,653
She's gonna look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

103
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,341
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

104
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:31,333
Soothing tones, soothing tones.

105
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,093
Here, here.
You want some?

106
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,140
I can't stand this.

107
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,939
He's got his claws on my--

108
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,494
Yeah, all right.

109
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,737
Try this salmon mousse.

110
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,337
Good.

111
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,930
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

112
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:57,736
It's creamier.

113
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:00,297
Yeah? Well, is that better?

114
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,811
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

115
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,010
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

116
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,293
God, what happened to you?

117
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,334
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests. . .

118
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,659
. . .intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

119
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:26,852
''You're suited for data processing for
a large multi national corporation. ''

120
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:31,332
That's so great because you
already know how to do that!

121
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,659
Can you believe it?

122
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,137
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something really cool?

123
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:41,169
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something. . . .

124
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,570
Something!

125
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,733
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

126
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:49,293
You can see your nipples
through this shirt.

127
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,491
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

128
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,539
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

129
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,534
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

130
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,539
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

131
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,572
Well, it is amusing.

132
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,650
Oh, hi, Wendy.

133
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,449
Yeah, 8:00.

134
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,820
What did we say, $ 1 0 an hour?

135
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,336
Okay, great.

136
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,577
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

137
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,214
Ten dollars an hour for what?

138
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,850
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

139
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,570
Waitressing?

140
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,893
Of course I thought of you.

141
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,936
But. . . .

142
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,257
But. . . .

143
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,297
But, but. . . .

144
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:52,572
But, you see, it's just this thing
has to go just perfect, you know. . .

145
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,655
. . .and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

146
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:03,572
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

147
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:11,492
You know, I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '7 6.

148
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,980
Amuse-bouche?

149
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:35,174
Talk to me.

150
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,534
A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning--

151
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,853
Talk dirty.

152
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,460
-Here?
-Come on.

153
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,736
Come on.

154
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,420
Say something. . .

155
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,180
. . .hot!

156
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,696
What?

157
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,330
What?

158
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,970
What?

159
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,290
What?

160
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,134
-What?
-Vulva.

161
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,570
''Vulva?''

162
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:19,737
All right, I panicked, all right?

163
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,653
She took me by surprise.

164
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:25,570
But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.

165
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,540
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

166
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,613
Shut up. It was nice.

167
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,133
I just don't think I'm
the dirty-talking kind of guy.

168
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,571
Just say what you want to do to her.

169
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,777
Or what you want her to do to you.

170
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:43,138
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

171
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,573
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

172
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,534
Please be kidding.

173
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,136
Why not? Come on.

174
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:58,010
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

175
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,018
I'm in my apartment. . . .

176
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,857
Yeah, what else?

177
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,700
You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!

178
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,012
-All right. I'll start.
-Joey, please.

179
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,371
Come on, come on.
All right, ready?

180
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,295
Oh, Ross. . .

181
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,334
. . .you get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

182
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,011
See?

183
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,729
Now you say something.

184
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,579
I really don't think so.

185
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:33,856
Come on.

186
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,654
You like this woman?

187
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,175
-You wanna see her again?
-Sure.

188
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,254
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

189
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,890
Now tell me you want
to caress my butt!

190
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, turn around.

191
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,930
I don't want you staring at me
while I do this.

192
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,735
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

193
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:56,976
Okay.

194
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,051
I want--

195
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,337
Okay, I want. . .

196
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,730
. . .to feel. . .

197
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,700
. . .your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

198
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,330
There you go.

199
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,134
Keep going, keep going.

200
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,137
I want to take my tongue and--

201
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:29,696
Say it.

202
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,050
Say it!

203
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,373
--run it all over your body. . .

204
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,376
. . .until you're trembling with--

205
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,936
With?

206
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,412
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

207
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,855
It's okay. It's okay.

208
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,138
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

209
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:16,014
While you were sleeping, that guy
from your old job called again.

210
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,171
Again?

211
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,334
-And again and again and again.
-And again.

212
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,097
And again!

213
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:31,050
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

214
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,733
Yeah, I miss you too.

215
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,536
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

216
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,930
That's very generous.

217
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,537
But look, this isn't about the money.

218
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,138
I need something more than a job.
I need something I really care about--

219
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:51,334
That's on top of the year-end
bonus structure?

220
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,809
-Your dream!
-Your dream!

221
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,337
Look, Al. Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

222
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:59,379
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

223
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,980
Stop saying numbers!

224
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,531
I'm telling you, you've got
the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy!

225
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,214
I'll see you Monday!

226
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:23,737
Wow! It's huge!

227
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,933
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

228
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,097
This is a cube!

229
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,650
Look at this.

230
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,139
You have a window!

231
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,729
Yes, indeedy.

232
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,133
-With a beautiful view of--
-Oh, look! That guy's peeing!

233
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,493
Okay. That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

234
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,939
Okay, sit down here. Sit down.

235
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,336
This is great. This is great.

236
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,095
You ready?

237
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,451
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

238
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,135
Thank you, that'll be all.

239
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,452
Last time I do that.
I promise.

240
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,539
Wendy, we had a deal.

241
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,373
Yeah, you promised.

242
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,775
Who was that?

243
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,095
Wendy bailed.

244
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,939
I have no waitress.

245
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,452
That's too bad.

246
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:35,737
Bye-bye.

247
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:38,934
-Ten dollars an hour!
-Nope.

248
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:40,370
$ 1 2 an hour.

249
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,972
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

250
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:48,259
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there for you.

251
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,210
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you. . . .

252
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,699
Twenty dollars an hour.

253
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:56,976
Done.

254
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:07,136
Well, hello! Welcome to Monica's!
May I take your coat?

255
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,412
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

256
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,339
Hello, greeter girl.

257
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,292
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

258
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,737
Everything smells so delicious.

259
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:26,059
I can't remember a time I smelled
such a delicious combination of--

260
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,495
Okay, smells.

261
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,972
It's a lovely apartment.

262
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,132
Thank you. Would you like a tour?

263
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,941
I was just being polite,
but all right.

264
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,056
What's up?

265
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:44,260
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

266
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,417
What?

267
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:50,332
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

268
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:54,572
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.

269
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,292
Is it dry in here?

270
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,537
Let me get you some wine.

271
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,255
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

272
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:11,331
These are rock shrimp ravioli. . .

273
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,651
. . .in a cilantro ponzu sauce. . .

274
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,131
. . .with just a touch of minced. . .

275
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,336
. . .ginger.

276
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,456
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

277
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,534
These are fantastic!

278
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:33,215
Oh, gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

279
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,617
Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

280
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:40,857
That's all there is of these. . .

281
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,252
. . .but in about 8 1 /2 minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

282
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,140
''Tartlets?''

283
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,020
''Tartlets. ''

284
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,454
''Tartlets. ''

285
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,298
Word has lost all meaning.

286
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:03,140
Excuse me. Can I help you
with anything?

287
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,736
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

288
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,014
Oh, cool! Taco shells!

289
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,932
These are-- They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

290
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,575
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

291
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:33,809
Sugar-O's!

292
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:37,332
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

293
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,617
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

294
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,300
No, we don't.

295
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:50,416
Sorry.

296
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,931
Why don't you just have a seat here?

297
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:03,696
Give me the Gummy Bears.

298
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,057
Give them to me.

299
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,171
We'll share.

300
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,611
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

301
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:13,731
Give them to me!

302
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,135
This is not working.

303
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,894
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

304
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,057
Hey, fellas! Grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

305
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:26,737
Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help!

306
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,014
That's it! Dinner is over!

307
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,137
-What?
-''What?''

308
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,814
-Why?
-''Why?''

309
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,211
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this. . .

310
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:38,572
. . .and you can't even wait
4 1/2 minutes for a tartlet?

311
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,090
What a tool.

312
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,736
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

313
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,974
I know. It's just I just thought
that this was, you know, ''it. ''

314
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,939
You'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

315
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,775
You know those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

316
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,971
So how did it go with Celia?

317
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,332
I was unbelievable.

318
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,940
All right, Ross!

319
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,340
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

320
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,856
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

321
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:27,252
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines. . .

322
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:29,174
. . .themes, a motif.

323
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:32,015
At one point, there were villagers.

324
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,691
And. . . .

325
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,538
Well, by the time we finished
with all the dirty talk. . .

326
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,215
. . .it was late and we were
both exhausted, so. . . .

327
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,929
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

328
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,935
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

329
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,179
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

330
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,619
Whoa! Where the hell is he?

331
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,978
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is. . .

332
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,338
. . .but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

333
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,252
Oh, really?
Let me tell you something.

334
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:05,938
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

335
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:22,256
How's this?

336
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,216
Sorry. How about over here?

337
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,139
That just means it's working.

338
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,337
Does this hurt?

339
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,339
How about this?

340
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,494
There you go!

341
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,410
Oh, the throb!

00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:10,055
This is unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:13,612
If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham about now.

3
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,647
There's the waitress.
Excuse me!

4
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:18,211
-Hello, miss?
-It's Phoebe!

5
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,655
Okay, will that be all?

6
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:25,691
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,125
I was over there. . .

8
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,890
. . .then you said, ''Excuse me, miss. ''
So now I'm here.

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:32,766
How come you're working here?

10
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:36,930
Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,451
Can we start over?

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,011
Okay, great.
I'm gonna be over here.

00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:31,889
I don't know if he's testing me
or just acting out. . .

16
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:34,610
. . .but my monkey is out of control!

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,613
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

18
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:42,006
Supposedly by accident.

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,248
Yeah, I've done that.

20
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,852
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did. . .

21
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:53,212
. . .and peed all over the crossword!

22
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:55,727
I've never done that.

23
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:59,734
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

24
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,247
I'm saying I see a difference.

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,605
They're twins.

26
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:07,246
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

27
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:11,415
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

28
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,408
Let's not do that anymore.

29
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,446
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today?

30
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,245
Oh, fun!

31
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,050
-Liam Neeson.
-No.

32
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:23,655
Morley Safer.

33
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,454
The woman who cuts my hair!

34
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,652
This could be a really long game.

35
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,045
Your sister, Ursula.

36
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:30,650
Oh, really?

37
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,534
She works at that place. . . .

38
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,805
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,695
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

40
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,806
So is she fat?

41
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,012
Not from where I was standing.

42
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,929
Where were you standing?

43
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:54,614
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

44
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,610
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

45
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:00,893
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

46
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,334
She was the first to walk. . .

47
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,329
. . .even though I did it
later that same day.

48
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,605
To my parents, by then it was,
''Yeah, what else is new?''

49
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:17,054
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

50
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:20,407
And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

51
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,407
Is this just gonna be you and Carol?

52
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,248
Susan will be there too.

53
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:31,614
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

54
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,894
Isn't that gonna be weird?

55
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,133
It might have been at first. . .

56
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,810
. . .but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

57
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:39,966
That's my jacket.

58
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,211
I know.

59
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,204
We're the Rostens.

60
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,055
I'm J.C. and he's Michael.

61
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:57,174
And we're having a boy and a girl.

62
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,405
Good for you!
Alrighty, next?

63
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,415
I'm Ross Geller.

64
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,846
And that's my boy in there.

65
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:12,612
And this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

66
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,615
Susan is Carol's. . . .

67
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,010
Who's next?

68
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,284
Sorry, Susan is. . .?

69
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,566
-Susan is Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

70
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,414
Like buddies.

71
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,012
Like lovers.

72
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,612
You know how close women can get.

73
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,246
-Susan and I live together.
-I was married to her.

74
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:41,050
-Carol, not me.
-It's a little complicated.

75
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,575
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely.

76
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,815
So, twins!

77
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,324
That's like two birds.

78
00:04:57,976 --> 00:04:59,614
--to you too, Helen!

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,850
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

80
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,007
Okay, send her in.

81
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,414
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

82
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,454
I was just going over your data.

83
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:18,011
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

84
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,173
Which is bad, because. . .?

85
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,173
It throws my WENUS out of whack.

86
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:24,292
Excuse me?

87
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,125
WENUS.

88
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,446
Weekly Estimated
Net Usage Statistics.

89
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,453
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

90
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:34,410
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your. . .

91
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:35,685
. . .WENUS.

92
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:49,013
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that. . .

93
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,406
. . .she's really, really cute.

94
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:55,815
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

95
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,611
Ross.

96
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,205
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

97
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:05,890
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

98
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,285
Marcel!

99
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,613
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

100
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,052
You give Rossy the remote--

101
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,005
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

102
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,086
Oh, cool.

103
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,246
Urkel. . .

104
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:28,010
. . .in Spanish is Urkel.

105
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,007
How did he do this?

106
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,166
Is leaving the Christmas lights up. . .

107
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,844
. . .your plan to keep us
merry all year long?

108
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:41,128
Someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's. . .

109
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,048
. . .but obviously someone forgot!

110
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,851
Someone was supposed to write:

111
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,810
''Rach, take down the lights''
and put it on the refrigera--

112
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,813
How long has that been there?

113
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,292
Where you been?

114
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:00,246
Riff's. I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.

115
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:04,011
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

116
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,205
Score.

117
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,205
She is so hot!

118
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,850
Okay, before you do
anything Joey-like. . .

119
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,246
. . .you might want to run it by. . . .

120
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,165
Pheebs?

121
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,731
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

122
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:27,008
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

123
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:31,094
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

124
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:39,129
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know. . .

125
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,604
. . .whatever.

126
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,408
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

127
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,610
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so. . . .

128
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,494
I don't know. Why not?

129
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,050
Cool. Thanks.

130
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,731
You okay?

131
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,409
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,610
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

133
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,411
Sorry.

134
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,246
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

135
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,533
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

136
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:27,290
You can go.
I'll get the information.

137
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:32,487
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

138
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,845
Oh, good.

139
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,449
This will be fun.

140
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:39,968
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

141
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,848
Mommies, get on your back.

142
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,805
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

143
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,451
-What?
-What?

144
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,334
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

145
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,812
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

146
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:04,291
I have to miss out on the coaching
training because I'm a woman?

147
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:06,214
So what do you propose to do?

148
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,606
-I'll flip you for it.
-Flip me for it?

149
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,295
Heads, heads, heads!

150
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,852
On your back, Mom!

151
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:20,609
All right, Mommies, take
a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

152
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:24,892
Good.

153
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,894
Now imagine your vagina is opening. . .

154
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,007
. . .like a flower.

155
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,287
Mr. Dee! How's it going, sir?

156
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,724
It's been better.

157
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,685
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

158
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,415
It's pretty ugly.

159
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,813
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

160
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:54,926
What's it mean?

161
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,532
We'll be laying off people.

162
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:01,571
I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

163
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,004
Not you.

164
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,815
Relax.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,414
Ever have to fire anyone?

166
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:10,886
Nina. . . .

167
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,051
Nina.

168
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:21,766
Are you okay?

169
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,293
Yes. Yes, I am.

170
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:30,605
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was. . . .

171
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,615
Please don't hate me.

172
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,212
What?

173
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,566
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

174
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:46,005
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

175
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:50,535
What I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

176
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,408
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

177
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,254
Bath salts would be nice!

178
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,406
Good.

179
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,249
What is this place?

180
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,056
You're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

181
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,008
How bad could it be?

182
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,207
I think we have an answer.

183
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,005
What's she doing here?

184
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:25,407
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

185
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:29,770
-Think she got fired at Riff's?
-No, we were there last night.

186
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,536
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go. . .?

187
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,846
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

188
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,451
It looks like her.

189
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,408
Excuse me?

190
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,495
Hi, it's us!

191
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,207
Right. And it's me!

192
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,088
So you're here too?

193
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,214
As much as you are.

194
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:54,811
Your turn.

195
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:56,931
We know what we want.

196
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,206
That's good.

197
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,844
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti cookies.

198
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,604
Good choice.

199
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,209
It's definitely her.

200
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,851
I can't believe you.

201
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:23,054
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job?

202
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,609
You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

203
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:31,132
Congratulations! I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

204
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,653
Trying to find the right moment.

205
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,808
That shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

206
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:42,328
''Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?''

207
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:52,813
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

208
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,409
I'll get it.

209
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,408
Hi, Mr. Heckles.

210
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:01,965
You're doing it again.

211
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:03,609
We're not doing anything.

212
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,808
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

213
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,007
I can hear you through the ceiling.

214
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,812
My cats can't sleep.

215
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,094
You don't even have cats.

216
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,127
I could have cats.

217
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,765
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

218
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:23,410
We'll try to keep it down.

219
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:30,010
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

220
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,173
Try this on to make sure it fits.

221
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,130
My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really--

222
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:39,448
It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

223
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,570
Sure. Yeah.

224
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,095
Okay, it fits.

225
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,525
Are you seeing her again?

226
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,852
Yep, Ice Capades.

227
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,251
This is serious.

228
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,607
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of ''capade. ''

229
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,448
I don't know. I like her.

230
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,893
She's different.
There's something about her--

231
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,291
That you like.
We get it. You like her.

232
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,644
Phoebe, I asked you
and you said it was okay.

233
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,687
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

234
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:17,207
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

235
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,248
Knit, good woman.
Knit! Knit!

236
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,815
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

237
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,009
Mr. Douglas.

238
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,485
Cool tie.

239
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:48,806
She's still here.

240
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,606
Yes. Yes, she is.

241
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,324
Didn't I memo you?

242
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:58,252
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen. . .

243
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,975
. . .Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

244
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:05,214
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

245
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,055
In fact, he mentioned
the word ''frenzy. ''

246
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,250
She seems so. . . .

247
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,208
Oh, no, no.
Nina? She's. . . .

248
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,212
In fact, if you asked her now. . .

249
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,214
. . .she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

250
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:21,571
That's unbelievable.

251
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,368
And yet believable.

252
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,012
So I decided not to fire her again. . .

253
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,447
. . .until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

254
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,414
I see. You never really know what's
going on inside a person's head.

255
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,412
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

256
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:44,014
The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

257
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:47,333
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

258
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:48,804
Lights, please.

259
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,455
And that's having a baby.

260
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:52,812
Next week is our final class.

261
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:55,809
Susan, go deep.

262
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,806
It's impossible.
It's just impossible.

263
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:04,051
What is, honey?

264
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,048
What that woman. . .

265
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,245
. . .did.

266
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,816
I am not doing that!

267
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:14,048
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

268
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:17,174
-It'll just stay in.
-Carol, honey.

269
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,936
-Everything will be all right.
-What do you know?

270
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:22,855
No one's saying to you,
''Hi, is that your nostril?

271
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,485
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?! ''

272
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,209
Carol, sweetie.

273
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,809
Cleansing breath.

274
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:34,054
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

275
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,571
The birth part is just one day. . .

276
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:40,969
. . .and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

277
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,010
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

278
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,245
Ross?

279
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,332
Ross.

280
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,973
I'm gonna be a father.

281
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:54,247
-This is just occurring to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

282
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:57,607
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

283
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,847
You're gonna be great.

284
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,415
How could you say that?

285
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,608
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

286
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:06,615
How will I raise a kid?

287
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,246
You know, some scientists
are now saying. . .

288
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,408
. . .that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

289
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,805
-Where are you going?
-Out.

290
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,409
With. . .?

291
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,134
Can I just ask you one question?

292
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,409
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

293
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,011
You know?

294
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:30,931
Yet?

295
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,653
Not that it's any
of your business. . .

296
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:35,534
. . .but no, we haven't.

297
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,007
You meant sex, right?

298
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,849
-Do you have a sec?
-Sure, Nina. What's up?

299
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,488
For the past few days,
people have been avoiding me. . .

300
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,573
. . .and giving me strange looks.

301
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,011
Oh, well, maybe that's because. . .

302
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,735
. . .they're jealous of us.

303
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,370
Maybe.

304
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,613
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

305
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:15,171
Well, maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

306
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,487
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

307
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,609
Oh, my God!
You're amazing!

308
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:24,007
Oh, you don't know.

309
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,132
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

310
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,615
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to personnel?

311
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,209
Helen drinks.

312
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,614
Will you marry me?

313
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:46,655
-I ended up telling her everything.
-How'd she take it?

314
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,809
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

315
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,174
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation. . .

316
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:56,015
. . .never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

317
00:18:57,176 --> 00:19:00,009
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

318
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,610
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

319
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,608
Because I can't watch.

320
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:10,806
They're gone.

321
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:13,974
Are you all right?

322
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,930
Yeah. It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

323
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,649
Okay, can I ask. . .?

324
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:23,013
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

325
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,526
Yeah.

326
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:29,253
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

327
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:32,215
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

328
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:36,247
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson thermos. . .

329
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,412
. . .so she threw it under the bus.

330
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,014
And then there's Randy Brown. . .

331
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:42,615
. . .who was like. . . .

332
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,854
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

333
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,851
Well, but that's what he was for me.

334
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,445
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away. . .

335
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,415
. . .and then broke his heart.

336
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,730
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

337
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:05,049
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

338
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,809
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my thermos. . .

339
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,209
. . .or anything, but. . . .

340
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:18,095
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

341
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:19,572
Yeah, okay.

342
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:22,768
He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt. . . .

343
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,534
He's falling in love with her.

344
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:26,647
They've been going out a week.

345
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:31,014
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

346
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,809
May we help you?

347
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,853
What are you doing? It's freezing!
Would you come inside?

348
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,808
No, no, no.

349
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,610
You wanted me to take them down. . .

350
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,284
. . .so I'm taking them down, okay?

351
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:28,726
Rachel!

352
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,012
I'm okay. I'm okay.

353
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:33,290
Mr. Heckles?

354
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,815
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

355
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:41,008
This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.

Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!

5
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:11,768
It's for Ursula.

6
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,532
Sure, yeah. Okay, it fits.

7
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,404
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

8
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,206
How did he do this?

9
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,642
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

10
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,929
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

11
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:28,282
-You don't know my sister.
-Talk to Joey.

12
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,211
-He's falling in love with her.
-You won't lose him.

13
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:34,722
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

14
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:40,126
May we help you?

15
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,965
Rachel! Rachel!

16
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,328
I'm okay! I'm okay!

18
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:55,292
My friend was taking down
our Christmas lights. . .

19
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,609
. . .and she fell off the balcony
and may have broken her ankle.

20
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:01,280
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

21
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:05,284
Fill this out and bring it back.

22
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,841
Here you go.

23
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,327
All right.

24
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:14,971
Name. . .

25
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:16,406
. . .address. . . .

26
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:19,689
In case of emergency, call. . .?

27
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,047
You.

28
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,408
Really?

29
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,084
Oh, that is so sweet!

30
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,168
Oh, gosh. I love you.

31
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,845
Okay, insurance?

32
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,930
Yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!

33
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:37,480
You don't have insurance?

34
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,245
Why? How much will this cost?

35
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,131
X-rays alone could be
a couple hundred dollars!

36
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,687
-What'll we do?
-There's not much we can do.

37
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,248
Unless I use yours.

38
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,401
Now wait a second.

39
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:56,684
Who did I just put as my
''in case of emergency'' person?

40
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:58,605
That's insurance fraud.

41
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:03,403
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.

42
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:09,648
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

43
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:14,804
I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

44
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:16,288
Why?

45
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,648
I am really an idiot!

46
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:23,083
I was filling out my friend's form. . .

47
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,362
. . .and instead of putting
her information. . .

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,806
. . .I put mine.

49
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,850
You are an idiot.

50
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,843
Yep, that's me.
I am that stupid.

51
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,690
I had a dream that I was
playing football with my kid.

52
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,686
That's nice.

53
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,644
No, no. With him.

54
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,724
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

55
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:52,967
I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay team's coming right at me!

56
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,248
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

57
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,451
Right, but. . .

58
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:03,440
. . .it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

59
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,725
And so, I. . .

60
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,845
. . .I just heave it downfield!

61
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:10,889
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby!

62
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,242
He should take the sack?

63
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,647
Anyway. . .

64
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:19,962
. . .suddenly I'm downfield.

65
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:23,887
And I realize that I'm the one
who's suppose to catch him, right?

66
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,726
Only I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.

67
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,684
So I am running and I'm running. . .

68
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,484
. . .and that is when I woke up.

69
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,963
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

70
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,003
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

71
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:39,443
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

72
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,684
You're gonna make a great dad.

73
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,368
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

74
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,250
Have you ever been to the
Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

75
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,084
Only if you order stuff.

76
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,286
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

77
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:02,450
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

78
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,208
Tonight.

79
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:08,646
Man, what are the odds
of that happening?

80
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,370
You take your time.

81
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:18,767
There it is!

82
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,522
What'll you do?

83
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:28,041
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

84
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,281
And your friend, Phoebe?

85
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:33,241
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?

86
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,484
If you tried that on my birthday. . .

87
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:38,849
. . .you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

88
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,244
An added pinch of saffron
makes all the difference.

89
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,248
Monica?

90
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,288
Yes?

91
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,529
Yes, she is.

92
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,163
This is my friend, Rachel.

93
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,851
Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

94
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,441
And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.

95
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,243
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

96
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,646
Excuse me?

97
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,689
God, young, young.
I meant young.

98
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,684
Young to be a doctor.

99
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,247
-Good, Rach.
-Thank you.

100
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,642
He said it was a sprain,
and that was it.

101
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,047
You left out the stupid part.

102
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:27,687
It's not stupid.

103
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:32,084
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

104
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,449
I think it's totally insane.
They work for the hospital.

105
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,450
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

106
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,886
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? Monica, they are cute.

107
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:46,602
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

108
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:49,441
All right, what have
we learned so far?

109
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,488
Oh, God.

110
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,560
Surprise!

111
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,651
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!

112
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:13,163
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah.

113
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:15,648
I got a lemon schmush.

114
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,248
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

115
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,245
I hope it's okay.

116
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:26,209
''Happy Birthday, Peehee. ''

117
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,487
Maybe we can make
a ''B'' out of a rose.

118
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,047
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

119
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,485
-What's going on?
-We just--

120
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:37,245
Surprise!

121
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,290
This is so great!

122
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,483
This was not at all scary.

123
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,331
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty!

124
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,726
Betty, hi!

125
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,083
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.

126
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,563
Everybody I love is in the same room.

127
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:57,404
Where's Joey?

128
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:01,485
Did you see Betty?

129
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:15,127
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.

130
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:20,090
Years ago, if somebody'd said, ''Here's
a tomato that looks like a prune'' . . .

131
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,567
. . .I'd have said,
''Get out of my office! ''

132
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,531
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

133
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,041
I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying. . .

134
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,726
. . .if someone had come to me
with the idea--

135
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,890
I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.

136
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,845
Did you ever get this sort of. . .

137
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:44,449
. . .panicky, ''Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father'' kind of a thing?

138
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:49,364
Your mother did the work.
I was busy with the business.

139
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,364
I wasn't around that much.

140
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,489
Is that what this is about?

141
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,364
No, no. I was just wondering.

142
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:58,882
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

143
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:03,330
You always wanted to go to coIonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

144
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,684
Thanks, Dad, really.

145
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,446
You know, I just, I just. . . .

146
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:11,287
I just needed to know. . .

147
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,450
. . .when did you start
to feel like a father?

148
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:20,522
Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

149
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,044
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep. . .

150
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,921
. . .and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

151
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,249
You were this ugly little red thing!

152
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,651
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist. . .

153
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,371
. . .and you squeezed it. . .

154
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:39,250
. . .so tight.

155
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,849
And that's when I knew.

156
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,610
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

157
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,643
We can go to Williamsburg.

158
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,445
Eat your fish.

159
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,762
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!

160
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,365
Okay, coming.

161
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,121
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

162
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,408
We brought wine.

163
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:14,049
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

164
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,368
-How could we resist?
-That's great!

165
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,048
-So, Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's. . . .

166
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,249
Why don't you tell them?

167
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,324
After all, it is your ankle.

168
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,650
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

169
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:32,441
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

170
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,042
Stat!

171
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,883
Listen, why don't we just
tell them who we really are?

172
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,841
-I think it'll be fine.
-It will not. We'll get in trouble.

173
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,883
Would you stop being such a wuss!

174
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,761
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

175
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,287
-So?
-So they still seem normal.

176
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,681
Because they are.

177
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,281
When we go out with women
we meet at the hospital--

178
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,727
Would you relax?
Take a look around.

179
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:04,051
There are no pagan altars.

180
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,845
No piles of bones in the corners.

181
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,122
They're fine. Go like this:

182
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:17,731
We are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!

183
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,490
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious.

184
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,762
-You get uptight--
-You act like a princess.

185
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,281
You know what? You know what?

186
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:28,246
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

187
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:29,851
Excuse me.

188
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,241
Here we go.

189
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,160
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

190
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:38,205
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

191
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:41,449
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

192
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,880
See, I was supposed to get married. . .

193
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,048
. . .but I left the guy at the altar.

194
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:54,926
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but. . .

195
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,447
. . .hey, that's me!

196
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,250
Why don't you try the hummus?

197
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:04,720
Monica, what do you do?

198
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:08,087
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

199
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,088
Good for you.

200
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,645
Yeah, it is.

201
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:16,642
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

202
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,604
Well, this hummus is great.

203
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,450
God bless the chickpea.

204
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,281
Oh, God!

205
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,847
I am so spoiled!

206
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:35,921
That's it.

207
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:40,046
And have I mentioned that
back in high school. . .

208
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:41,571
. . .I was a cow?

209
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,848
I used to wet my bed.

210
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:49,411
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

211
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,450
We both do that!

212
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,851
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

213
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,886
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.

214
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:15,926
Hi, Dad.

215
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,043
No, no. It's me.

216
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,646
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now.

217
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:23,843
But there's something. . . .

218
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,771
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

219
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,248
Excuse me.

220
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,608
Remember back in freshman year?

221
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,645
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

222
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,087
Daddy. . . .

223
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,885
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?

224
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:51,282
His father tried to put
you out of business!

225
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,931
You are dead!

226
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,087
Ross, he's got the remote again.

227
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:00,447
Good.

228
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,891
Maybe he can switch it back.

229
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,881
Maybe not.

230
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,288
Hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

231
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:22,246
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

232
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,090
Oh, God, what do we do?

233
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:26,050
Just find out what they want.

234
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,044
Okay. No, you do it.

235
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,848
Hello. This is Monica.

236
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:37,087
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

237
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,851
We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.

238
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:44,165
-You're right, this wasn't worth it.
-Thank you.

239
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:46,044
Let me just change.

240
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:52,927
Trouble?

241
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,168
Your sister stood me up
the other night.

242
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,842
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

243
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,565
-Did you try calling her?
-I've been trying for two days.

244
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,451
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was busy.

245
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:10,252
I can't believe
she's blowing me off!

246
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,290
You got a minute?

247
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,251
Yeah, I'm just working.

248
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:51,723
I got you a birthday present.

249
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,451
Wow, you remembered!

250
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,088
It's a Judy Jetson thermos.

251
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,520
Like the kind you--

252
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:03,847
Right.

253
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:06,562
Oh, I got something for you too.

254
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,649
How'd you know I was coming?

255
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:11,129
Yeah, twin thing.

256
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,523
I can't believe you did this.

257
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,450
I can't believe you. . .

258
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,250
. . .did this!

259
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,408
So what's the deal
with you and Joey?

260
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,486
Oh, right.

261
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,365
He is so great.
But that's over.

262
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,010
-Does he know?
-Who?

263
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:38,289
Joey. You know, he's really nutsy
about you.

264
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:40,165
He is? Why?

265
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:41,441
You got me.

266
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,481
Excuse me. . .

267
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,246
. . .doesn't this come
with a side salad?

268
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,564
So are you gonna call him?

269
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,525
-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

270
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,447
No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

271
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,250
Do you want some chicken?

272
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,242
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

273
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,168
You have not changed.

274
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:06,845
Yeah, you too.

275
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:11,691
Hi! Remember us?

276
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:17,081
You just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

277
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:19,687
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

278
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:21,888
Because, you see. . .

279
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,448
. . .I put the wrong name again.

280
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,851
-Because--
-You're that stupid!

281
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:31,646
I am. I'm that stupid!

282
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,601
And I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

283
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,764
Your insurance will cover that.

284
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,440
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

285
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,011
Okay, worst case scenario:

286
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:45,448
Say you never feel like a father.

287
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,440
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

288
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,402
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

289
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,250
Do you have a point?

290
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,243
You know, you'd think I would.

291
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,049
What's up with the simian?

292
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,048
It's just a fur ball.

293
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,411
Whose turn is it?

294
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,489
Yours. I got
43 points for ''kidney. ''

295
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:16,089
No, you got
zero points for ''idney. ''

296
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,522
I had a ''K. ''
Where's my ''K''?

297
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:28,130
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a ''K'' !

298
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:29,765
Get that animal out of here!

299
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:33,282
The animal hospital is across town.
He's choking!

300
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:36,052
-What is it?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

301
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:38,888
Excuse me.

302
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,562
This hospital is for people!

303
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:44,047
He is people!
He has a name, okay?

304
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,810
He watches Jeopardy!...

305
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,651
. . .he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

306
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,125
Please have a heart.

307
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,482
-I'll take a look at him.
-Thank you.

308
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:54,721
-Michael!
-Rachel.

309
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:56,650
-What?
-Monica.

310
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:12,847
Urs!

311
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,243
I've been trying to call you.

312
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,367
Listen. . . .

313
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:21,247
Don't say ''listen. '' I know that
''listen. '' I've said that ''listen. ''

314
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:23,448
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,363
I don't get it.
What happened?

316
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,921
What about what
you said under the bridge?

317
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,366
Forget about what
I said under the bridge.

318
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,644
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

319
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,242
You don't drink.

320
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,843
That's right, I don't.

321
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,243
But I was drunk on you.

322
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,050
But it's not gonna work.

323
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,292
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

324
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:57,165
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

325
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,124
No, I couldn't do that.

326
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,443
Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

327
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,451
So you know, it's either her or me.

328
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,845
Then I'm sorry.

329
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,247
You're gonna be
really hard to get over.

330
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,041
I know.

331
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:34,244
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what. . .

332
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,403
. . .but you've never
looked so beautiful.

333
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,041
Really?

334
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,846
Pheebs?

335
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,520
He looks so tiny.

336
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:23,804
-We just got the message.
-Is he okay?

337
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:26,242
The doctor got the ''K'' out.

338
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,082
He also found an ''M'' and an ''O. ''

339
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,651
We think he was trying
to spell out ''monkey. ''

340
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:43,042
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

341
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,370
So you feel like a dad yet?

342
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,284
No. Why?

343
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:52,122
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

344
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,050
That's very ''dad. ''

345
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,402
He's waking up.

346
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,087
Hey, fella.
How you doing?

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,803
Rach, we're running low on r�sum�s.

2
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,602
Do you want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,288
If you must work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,322
Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.

5
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,563
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.

6
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:33,084
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me. ''

7
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,088
Rach, did you proofread these?

8
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,048
Why?

9
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,489
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills!

10
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,570
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,688
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,889
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few!

13
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:57,931
The One With the Poker

GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:45,767
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,646
Hi, ladies.

17
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,249
Can I get you anything?

18
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,488
-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.

19
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,690
Really? Sure we have scones left!

20
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,287
Read them to me.

21
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:02,844
''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you
for your inquiry. However. . . . ''

22
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,485
-We have apple cinnamon--
-''Dear Miss Greene'' . . . .

23
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,170
Your VISA bill is huge!

24
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:16,568
Give me that.

25
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,724
I can't believe you.
Linda's great.

26
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,883
-Why won't you date her?
-I don't know.

27
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,360
Is this still about her. . .

28
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:25,291
. . . ''The Flintstones could
have really happened'' thing?

29
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,687
It's not just that.

30
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,531
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me. . .

31
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:32,569
. . .who gets my heart pounding. . .

32
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,483
. . .who makes me. . . .

33
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,686
Little play things with yarn?

34
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,127
What?

35
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,722
Could you want her more?

36
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,368
Who?

37
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:50,042
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!

38
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:53,848
Who?

39
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,607
Look, I am totally, totally over her.

40
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,285
-I just--
-Coffee?

41
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,887
No, we're fine.
We're fine.

42
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:09,848
Shut up!

43
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,008
We're not saying anything.

44
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,367
What?

45
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,483
Joey cried last night.

46
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,166
Thank you.

47
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,166
We were playing poker.

48
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,170
There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.

49
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,930
God, you should've seen him.
''Read them and weep! ''

50
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,730
And then he did.

51
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,687
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

52
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:37,891
What is that? Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

53
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,811
Like it's poker,
so only guys can play?

54
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,531
Women are welcome to play.

55
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,731
Then what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know. . . .

56
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,371
All right, what is it?

57
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,362
There just aren't
any women in our game.

58
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:56,247
We just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

59
00:03:56,452 --> 00:04:00,240
Please! That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

60
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,771
Do you know how to play?

61
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,566
No.

62
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,480
But you could teach us.

63
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,085
No.

64
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:16,281
Okay, so now we draw cards.

65
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,127
I wouldn't need any,
because I have a straight.

66
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,687
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

67
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,210
Pheebs, how many do you want?

68
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:34,283
I just need two. The 1 0 of spades
and the 6 of clubs.

69
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,485
Pheebs, you can't do that.

70
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,450
I've got the 1 0 of spades. Here.

71
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,562
Thanks.

72
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,490
See, you can't do that.

73
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,927
I don't need them.
I'm going for 4s.

74
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,201
Oh, you're. . . .

75
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:54,802
Here we go.

76
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,089
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudit�s.

77
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,926
What are you doing?

78
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:03,881
This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.

79
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:08,324
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz--

80
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,166
At this point, the dealer--

81
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,967
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes! Big bucks!

82
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,527
You sure? Phoebe
just threw away two jacks. . .

83
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,524
. . .because they didn't look happy.

84
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,284
But I'm ready. So just deal.

85
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,490
Everybody, last minute
lesson! Joey. . . .

86
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,886
Three. . .

87
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,002
. . .eight!

88
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,568
Eight, three. All right!

89
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,448
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

90
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,082
I see. So then you were lying.

91
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,487
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.

92
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,321
I was bluffing.

93
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,402
And what is ''bluffing''?

94
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,289
Is it not another word for lying?

95
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,649
Sorry to break up this party. . .

96
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,650
. . .but I've got r�sum�s to fax
before work tomorrow.

97
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:03,331
Rach, we've got to settle.

98
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,846
Settle what?

99
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,081
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

100
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:12,691
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so. . . .

101
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:18,570
The game, Rachel.
You owe us money for the game.

102
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:19,568
Oh, right!

103
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248
Guys, it's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

104
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,727
Hell, no! We'll pay.

105
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:29,487
Okay, Monica, I had
another answer all ready.

106
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,687
And you know what?

107
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,486
-We want a rematch.
-That's fine with me.

108
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,091
Could use the money.

109
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:41,571
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

110
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,766
And I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

111
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,969
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

112
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,891
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win.

113
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,487
In order for me to win,
others have to lose.

114
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,128
If you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be nice.

115
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,284
Because once those cards
are dealt. . . .

116
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,688
I'm not a nice guy.

117
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,684
All right, boys. Let's eat.

118
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:31,282
Did you get that from
the ''I Love Rachel'' pizzeria?

119
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,922
Are you still on that?

120
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:35,692
Come on. What was with that
Black Bart speech?

121
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:39,083
''When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy'' !

122
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,166
You're way off, pal.

123
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,842
I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her!

124
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:50,082
I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

125
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,852
I just-- Marcel!

126
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,610
Where are you going
with that disk?

127
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,286
You are not putting that on again.

128
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:01,246
If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

129
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:17,446
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

130
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,448
Yeah, I know.

131
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,688
He can get really competitive.

132
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,407
What?

133
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,284
''Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! ''

134
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,885
Please!

135
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,922
I am not as bad as Ross.

136
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:38,920
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

137
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,531
That was not an incident.

138
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:45,084
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

139
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:52,162
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

140
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,688
Saks Fifth Avenue!

141
00:08:56,972 --> 00:09:00,282
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

142
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,001
What's the job?

143
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,089
Assistant buyer!

144
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,288
I would be shopping. . .

145
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,489
. . .for a living!

146
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:19,081
That's Aunt Iris. This woman's been
playing poker since she was 5.

147
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,647
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

148
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,365
-Is Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

149
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,603
He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.

150
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,610
-My God! Really?
-No, that's bluffing! Lesson one!

151
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,485
Let me tell you something.

152
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:38,525
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap!

153
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,483
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

154
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:46,083
Girls, sit down!

155
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,607
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and that's Rachel--

156
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:52,128
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

157
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:04,043
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

158
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,691
All right.

159
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,368
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

160
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,010
Guys, guess what, guess what?

161
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,803
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they all recommend Trident?

162
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,847
No, the interview!

163
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,684
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.

164
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:49,607
We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

165
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,084
And I went to camp with her cousin.

166
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,324
And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!

167
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:56,601
That's great!

168
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,922
God! And she told
the funniest story.

169
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,049
Great, you'll tell us
and we'll laugh!

170
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,446
Let's play poker!

171
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,010
Listen, we talked about it. . .

172
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,284
. . .and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

173
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,682
We can play some other game. Like. . .

174
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,047
. . .Pictionary?

175
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,520
Very funny.

176
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:19,047
We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

177
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:20,685
Yes, I think we should.

178
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,890
Rach, do you want me
to shuffle those?

179
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,692
That's okay,
I'm gonna give it a go.

180
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,325
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.

181
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,484
And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

182
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,361
Thanks for teaching us ''Crossed-eyed
Mary. '' We gotta play that other way.

183
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:53,960
Here's my 7.50, but you should
know that this money is cursed.

184
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,083
-What?
-I cursed it!

185
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,731
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

186
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,290
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

187
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,807
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

188
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,967
So that just leaves the big
Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.

189
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,491
It's so typical:

190
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:18,087
''I'm a man! I have a penis!

191
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,887
I have to win money
to exert my power over women! ''

192
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,771
You know, this isn't over.

193
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,044
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

194
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,844
And you will beg and we will laugh.

195
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,724
And we will take
every last dime you have.

196
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,486
And you will
hate yourselves forever!

197
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,891
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Monica!

198
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,289
Wanna hand over your money now?

199
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,649
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of playing.

200
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:57,570
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh, monkey boy.

201
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:03,330
Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?

202
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,081
You guys, look! The one-eyed Jack
follows me wherever I go.

203
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,529
Right, okay. Serious poker.

204
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,728
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

205
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:14,808
To the bathroom.

206
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,641
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or play poker?

207
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,445
I wanna go to the bathroom.

208
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,882
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

209
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:28,365
I'm waiting to hear from that job. The
store closes at 9. You can eat then.

210
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:33,085
That's fine. I'll just have
a Tic Tac to hold me over.

211
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:38,161
Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

212
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,328
Yes!

213
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:41,891
Or no!

214
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,210
Your money's mine, Greene.

215
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,004
Your fly's open, Geller.

216
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,370
You know what I just realized?

217
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:00,409
''Joker'' is ''poker'' with a ''J'' !

218
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,131
Coincidence?

219
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,080
That's ''joincidence'' with a ''C'' !

220
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,290
Yeah, I'm out.

221
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,401
I'm in.

222
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:25,727
Me too.

223
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,690
Me too.
What do you got?

224
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:32,929
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

225
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,290
Well, well, well!

226
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:42,083
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four 6s!

227
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,125
I got four 6s!
I won! I actually won!

228
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh, my God!

229
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,370
You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

230
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:55,483
I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .

231
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:00,641
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

232
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,002
And your fly's still open

233
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,089
I made you look

234
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:10,326
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be inner.

235
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,040
Monica, in or out?

236
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,084
I hate this game!

237
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay, Joey, your bet.

238
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,729
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach. . .

239
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,725
. . .by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

240
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,321
I'm out.

241
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,483
I'm very in.

242
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,567
Couldn't be more out.

243
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,682
Me too.

244
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,327
I will see you and I'll raise you.

245
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,649
Do you wanna waste another buck?

246
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,891
No, not this time.

247
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,403
-What did you have?
-I'm not telling.

248
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:57,727
Come on, show them.

249
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,525
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

250
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,690
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

251
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,887
Your whole face is getting red.

252
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:12,488
Little veins popping out
of your temple.

253
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,369
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

254
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:23,687
-I'm not losing. Just deal the--
-You are definitely losing.

255
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,967
Rachel Greene.

256
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,007
Excuse me.

257
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,964
It's about the job!

258
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,767
Barbara, hi! How are you?

259
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,571
No, I understand.

260
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:44,282
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

261
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,807
But, you know, if anything else
opens up, please--

262
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,087
Sorry, Rach.

263
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,926
You know, there's gonna be
lots of other stuff.

264
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,285
Where were we?

265
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,445
Five card draw. Jacks are better.

266
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,051
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

267
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,888
Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.

268
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,085
Yes, we do.

269
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,648
-All right. Check.
-Check.

270
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,326
I'm in for 50 cents.

271
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,282
-Call.
-I'm in.

272
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,732
I see your 50 cents. . .

273
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,883
. . .and I raise you. . .

274
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:44,368
. . . $5.

275
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,402
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

276
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,411
I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet $5.

277
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,688
Does anybody
have a problem with that?

278
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,688
-Not at all.
-No, no.

279
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,721
Loser?

280
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,601
No, I fold.

281
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,287
What do you mean, you ''fold''?
What is this?

282
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:16,730
I thought that, ''Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! ''

283
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,405
Were you just full of it?

284
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,081
I'm in.

285
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,968
-How many do you want?
-One.

286
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,090
Dealer takes two.

287
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:42,411
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

288
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,285
See your 2. . .

289
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,088
. . .and I raise you. . .

290
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,368
. . .20.

291
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:57,922
I see your 20. . .

292
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:00,768
. . .raise you 25.

293
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,883
See your 25. . .

294
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,010
. . .and, Monica, get my purse.

295
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,925
There's nothing in it.

296
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,282
Okay, then get me your purse.

297
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,765
Here you go. Good luck!

298
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:29,961
Thank you.

299
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,922
I saw your 25 and I raise you. . .

300
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,248
. . .seven.

301
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:37,927
--teen!

302
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,730
Joey, I'm a little shy.

303
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,486
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

304
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,483
-What do you need?
-Fifteen.

305
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,529
-Here's 1 0.
-I got 5.

306
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,763
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

307
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,326
I am calling your 1 7.

308
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,130
What do you got?

309
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,686
Full house!

310
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,891
You got me.

311
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,971
-That's a tough hand to beat.
-I thought we had them!

312
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,847
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

313
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:49,929
But look how happy she is.

314
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:01,762
-Airmail.
-Airplane.

Airport '7 7! Airport '79!

317
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,567
Time's up.

318
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,811
Bye Bye Birdie!

319
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,085
That's a bird?

320
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:17,291
That's a bird!

321
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,484
Okay, it's my turn.

322
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:23,527
Go!

323
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,929
Bean! Bean!

Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

Oh, good, because
where else would we get any?

Oh, right.

00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,970
Great.

00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,336
Wow! She is pretty.

23
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,816
Lucky. . .

24
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,735
. . .to have had a friend like you.

25
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,854
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice.

26
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,733
Good boy.
Give me the rice.

27
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,539
Thank you. Good boy.

28
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,699
He's mastered the difference
between ''bring me the'' . . .

29
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,619
. . .and ''pee in the. ''

30
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,020
''Bring me the'' and--
Rach?

31
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:22,614
Oh, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,139
This is so stupid!

33
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,417
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

34
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,612
I should be happy for them.

35
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,459
I am. I'm happy for them.

36
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,414
Really?

37
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:38,337
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

38
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,894
Whoa, what. . . .

39
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,059
What happened to
''Forget relationships!

40
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,611
I'm done with men''?
The whole penis embargo?

41
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,330
I don't know.

42
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,333
I guess it's not about ''no guys. ''

43
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,651
It's about the ''right guy,''
you know?

44
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,697
With Barry. . .

45
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,893
. . .it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

46
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,132
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

47
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,858
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual--

48
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,012
Right, right! I got it.

49
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,015
I was there.

50
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,011
But do you think
you can ever have both?

51
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,217
Someone that's your best friend. . .

52
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,770
. . .but then also can make
your toes curl.

53
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,615
Yes, I do. I really do.

54
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,058
In fact, it's funny.

55
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:30,059
Often, someone who
you wouldn't think could. . .

56
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,453
. . .curl your toes. . .

57
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,936
. . .might just be the one who--

58
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,660
--gets interrupted.

59
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,459
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

60
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,253
-Wonderful!
-It was so good!

61
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,214
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

62
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:50,652
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with, like, guns and bombs. . .

63
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,011
. . .and buses going really fast!

64
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,815
I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie. . .

65
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,621
. . .as long as
there's a little nudity.

66
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:01,731
There was nudity.

67
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,135
I meant female nudity.

68
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,935
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

69
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,692
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

70
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,612
All right, I've got to go.

71
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,174
Come on, Marcel.
Come on!

72
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,010
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

73
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,810
They're still just friends, right?

74
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,531
And I will see you tomorrow.

75
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:30,659
Right. You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

76
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,580
Hang on. Does Aunt Monica
get a say in this?

77
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,536
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

78
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,618
Oh, unclench.
You won't even be here.

79
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,456
I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

80
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,818
I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.

81
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,019
If it was gonna happen
with Rachel. . .

82
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,694
. . .wouldn't it
have happened already?

83
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,210
She said she's looking
for a relationship. . .

84
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,173
. . .with someone exactly like me.

85
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,610
She said that?

86
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,251
Well, I added
the ''exactly like me'' part.

87
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,617
But she said
she's looking for someone.

88
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,698
And someone will be there tonight.

89
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,136
''Tonight'' tonight?

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,055
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

91
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,418
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

92
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:22,217
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

93
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:30,374
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine. . .

94
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,971
. . .go over there
and try to woo her.

95
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,094
You know what you should do?

96
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:40,452
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

97
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,460
If you keep this up...

98
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,010
... you'll be finished
by the weekend.

99
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,333
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

100
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,811
Now, she used to be a man.

101
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,580
Look. See, there's Raven.

102
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,373
We hate her.

103
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,253
We're glad she's dying.

104
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,810
And then--
What? Marcel!

105
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:06,610
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--

106
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:12,293
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

107
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,334
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

108
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,219
Oh, God!

109
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,218
Sorry, Barry.

110
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,777
A little engagement gift.

111
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,575
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

112
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,812
Who died? Who died?

113
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,895
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

114
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:47,179
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because--

115
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,370
Marcel?

116
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,051
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

117
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:57,737
We were watching TV,
then he pooped in Monica's shoe. . . .

118
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,734
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

119
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:01,976
I don't know.

120
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,734
The left one!

121
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:04,931
Which ones?

122
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,975
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

123
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,375
Why is the air in here so negative?

124
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,453
Rachel lost Marcel.

125
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:19,497
Oh, no! How?

126
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,811
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

127
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,211
Those cute black ones
I wear all the time.

128
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,974
No, which one?

129
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,379
The right or left?

130
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,372
Because the left one is lucky.

131
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,214
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

132
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,139
All right.
You're a monkey. . .

133
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,019
. . .you're loose in the city.

134
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,779
Where do you go?

135
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,090
It's his first time out, so he'll
do some of the touristy things.

136
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:49,610
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

137
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:52,861
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

138
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,410
He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!

139
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,016
Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.

140
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,740
We'll take third and fourth.

141
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,260
What am I gonna do?

142
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,770
You stay here
and just wait by the phone.

143
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:07,178
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

144
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,612
Does anybody want to trade?

145
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:17,897
What do you want?

146
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,777
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

147
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,178
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

148
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,618
Why'd you leave it in the hall?

149
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,490
I wasn't ready for it.

150
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,892
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

151
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,859
I saw Regis Philbin once.

152
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,493
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

153
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,259
You owe me a waffle.

154
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,411
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face. . .

155
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,779
. . .with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

156
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,770
Thanks.

157
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:54,689
How did it go today?

158
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,813
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

159
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,295
Is that wine?

160
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,295
You want some?

161
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,339
Oh, I would love some.

162
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,811
But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.

163
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:08,376
I feel crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

164
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:18,014
We could. But before we go to
the murder capital of the Northeast. . .

165
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,853
. . .I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

166
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,615
You know how we
were talking before. . .

167
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,452
. . .about relationships and stuff. . . .

168
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,614
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

169
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:41,210
Oh, God!

170
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,175
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

171
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,816
Please don't hate me.

172
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:47,776
What? What?

173
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,299
You know Marcel?

174
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,057
I kind of lost him.

175
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,293
I can't believe this.

176
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,135
All I asked you to do was
keep him in the apartment!

177
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,456
I know. I'm sorry.

178
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,458
I guess it's partially my fault.

179
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,374
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

180
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,811
I should have started you off
with a pencil.

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,619
I'm doing everything I can.

182
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:33,619
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got--

183
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,653
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

184
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:41,177
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

185
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,370
Why? Do you not like them?

186
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:53,100
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

187
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,420
I'm not allowed to have him.

188
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:01,011
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

189
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,812
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

190
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,051
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

191
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,540
Hi! Thanks for coming.

192
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,612
Somebody called about a monkey?

193
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:21,337
You know what? That was
a complete misunderstanding.

194
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,850
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

195
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,057
-It turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

196
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,695
We checked the third floor.
No one's seen Marcel.

197
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:31,970
My uncle Marcel.

198
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,570
Is that who the monkey's named after?

199
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,172
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable. . .

200
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,413
. . .by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

201
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,650
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,656
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

203
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:56,612
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

204
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,610
Yes, but there isn't always time.

205
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:07,417
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

206
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,856
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

207
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,809
Oh, my God, you are!

208
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,494
And you're Rachel Greene!

209
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,655
Luisa Gianetti!
Lincoln High?

210
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:22,218
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

211
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,859
Luisa! Oh, my God!

212
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,097
Monica! It's Luisa!

213
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,212
Luisa! From homeroom!

214
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,060
You have no idea who I am, do you?

215
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,859
Not at all.

216
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,975
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

217
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,619
Would it have been so hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa'' . . .

218
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,817
. . .or ''Nice overalls''?

219
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh, I'm so sorry!

220
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:58,019
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

221
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,896
But you. What a bitch!

222
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,890
What?

223
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,410
You know what?
Be that as it may.

224
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,654
Could you help us out here on that
monkey thing for old times' sake?

225
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,613
Go, Bobcats!

226
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,214
I could. But I won't.

227
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,219
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

228
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,291
Sorry.

229
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,616
Marcel?

230
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,210
Marcel?

231
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,819
Hi, can I help you?

232
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,935
We're kind of having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

233
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,610
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

234
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,421
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

235
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,259
Can you fix radiators?

236
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,692
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

237
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:04,057
Of course!

238
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,013
Oh. Then, no.

239
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:12,056
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?

240
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,656
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

241
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,459
Oh, no, wait!

242
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,210
We may not know
about radiators, per se. . .

243
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:24,937
. . .but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

244
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,811
Weren't we in the middle
of something?

245
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,178
But these women are very hot
and they need our help.

246
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,979
And they're very hot!

247
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,259
We can't, all right?

248
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,854
We're sorry.

249
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:46,810
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised to find this monkey.

250
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,013
He's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

251
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,577
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

252
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,973
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

253
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:14,530
-Oh, my God!
-What?!

254
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,579
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

255
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,015
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

256
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:23,891
Look, Phoebe!

257
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,657
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

258
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,300
Step aside, ladies.

259
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,859
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.

260
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,052
Run, Marcel! Run, Marcel!

261
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,217
Damn!

262
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:52,291
Are you okay?

263
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,651
I think so.

264
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:03,617
Oh, gosh!

265
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,657
We've been all
over the neighborhood!

266
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,334
He's gone!
He's just gone!

267
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:21,539
-You don't know that.
-Come on! It's cold, it's dark.

268
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,817
He doesn't know the Village!

269
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:26,451
And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my--

270
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,931
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

271
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,330
Thank you very much!

272
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,254
I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

273
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,093
What do you want me to do?

274
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,859
You want me to break my foot too?

275
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:38,972
Here, I'll break my foot right now.

276
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:42,491
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

277
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:45,818
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign. . .

278
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:49,220
. . .I don't miss Marcel anymore!

279
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,695
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

280
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,051
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

281
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,610
Things just sort of happen around you!

282
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,052
You're off in ''Rachel Land,''
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' . . .

283
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:07,056
. . .oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and--

284
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,134
I don't even want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

285
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,414
What? What?

286
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,412
Hey, banana man!

287
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh, this is so intense!

288
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:30,216
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

289
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,416
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

290
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:39,016
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

291
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,216
I don't have a monkey.

292
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,135
-Then what's with all the bananas?
-Potassium.

293
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,013
Okay, where is he?
Where is he?

294
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,810
What have you done to him?

295
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,336
That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.

296
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,814
Are you insane?

297
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,818
Come here, Marcel.

298
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,136
Come here, Patty.

299
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,774
Come here, Marcel.

300
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,137
Come here, Patty.

301
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,212
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

302
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,816
Gotcha!

303
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,615
-Give me my monkey back!
-That's my monkey.

304
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,738
Take this up with the judge.

305
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,977
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

306
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,058
You can send it back whenever.

307
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,259
All right, I want my monkey!

308
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,179
Oh, come on, Luisa.

309
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:30,370
Sorry, prom queen.

310
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:33,698
You had to be a bitch in school,
you couldn't have been fat.

311
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,251
In high school,
I was the prom queen. . .

312
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,811
. . .and the homecoming queen
and the class president and you. . .

313
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,972
. . .were also there.

314
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,058
If you take this monkey, I'll lose. . .

315
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,980
. . .one of the most
important people in my life.

316
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:52,776
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

317
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:56,018
Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

318
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,097
Take it!

319
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,820
Then I'll call your supervisor
and tell her. . .

320
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,774
. . .you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart!

321
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,421
It'll be nice
to get this off, won't it?

322
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,414
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

323
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:26,376
With the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

324
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,410
Listen. . . .

325
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,535
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before--

326
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,733
No, come on. It was my fault.
I almost lost your--

327
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:41,490
But you got him back.
You were great.

328
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:49,016
We still have that bottle of wine.

329
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,610
Are you in the mood for. . .

330
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:52,930
. . .something grape?

331
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,258
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

332
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:09,018
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

333
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,012
Well, as long as we're. . .

334
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,415
. . .here. . .

335
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,818
. . .and not on the subject. . . .

336
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,217
I was thinking about. . .

337
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,379
. . .how mad we got
at each other before.

338
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,331
And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we--

339
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,658
-Rachel?
-Barry?

340
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,171
I can't. I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

341
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,578
I'm still in love with you.

342
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:55,017
We have got to start
locking that door!

343
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:07,654
This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?

344
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,773
Because I'm in front of them.

345
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,611
I thought that was an alp.

346
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,098
High school was not
my favorite time.

347
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:17,212
I don't know.
I loved high school.

348
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:21,130
It was just like four years
of parties and dating and sex and--

349
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:24,533
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

350
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:27,898
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

351
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:33,215
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

352
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,618
My butt cheek is waking up!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:06,169
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

2
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:09,533
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:12,364
No way!
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:15,289
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,132
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,129
They're crazy!

7
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:26,525
Oh, my God! You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,534
There's some creep out there
with a telescope!

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,930
I can't believe it!
He's looking right at us!

10
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,967
Oh, that is so sick!

11
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,774
I feel violated.

12
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,688
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:41,409
How can people do that?

14
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,616
You guys, look!
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,293
The One With the Evil Orthodontist

17
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:41,373
I tell you, years from now,
school children will study it. . .

18
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:44,528
. . .as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,331
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,534
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,572
Have you called her?

22
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,131
Let her know I like her?
Are you insane?

23
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,004
Guys! It's gross!

24
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,650
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

25
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,170
I'm right. Right?

26
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,929
Yeah, let her dangle.

27
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:05,130
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me. . .

28
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:06,849
. . .to find one of you people.

29
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,530
God!
Come on. Just do it.

30
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:13,007
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

31
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:17,136
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

32
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,327
-I got her machine.
-Her answering machine?

33
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:26,811
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

34
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,366
So why didn't you say anything?

35
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:35,176
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message. . .

36
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,135
. . .I ended up using the phrase,
''Yes, indeed-io! ''

37
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:43,328
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look at once.

38
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,455
Okay! What's going on?

39
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,884
They're just talking.

40
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,575
Does he look upset?

41
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:51,250
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

42
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:55,573
No. Actually, he's smiling.

43
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,852
Oh, my God! Don't do that!

44
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:58,966
What? What? What?

45
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:02,134
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

46
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:09,731
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

47
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,172
See?

48
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,531
Hey, Rach.

49
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,925
How'd it go?

50
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,931
You know, it was actually
really great.

51
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,173
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

52
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,089
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

53
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,692
Not a good day for birds.

54
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,568
Then we took a walk to Bendel's.

55
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:33,331
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

56
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,046
That's nice.

57
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,730
Now was that before or after
you told him. . .

58
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:41,246
. . .to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

59
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:43,412
Right.

60
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,289
Well, we never actually got to that.

61
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,369
It was just so nice to see him again,
you know?

62
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,932
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

63
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,775
It was just nice.

64
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,734
That's nice twice.

65
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,251
What's going on?

66
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:01,930
Isn't this the same Barry who
you left at the altar?

67
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:03,695
Where have you been?

68
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,447
But it was different
with him today.

69
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,335
He wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, you know?

70
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,171
I mean, we had fun!
Is there anything wrong with that?

71
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,012
Why?

72
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,934
I have my reasons.

73
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:25,169
How about the fact that he's
engaged to another woman. . .

74
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,725
. . .who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

75
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,326
All right, all right!
I know it's stupid.

76
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:33,693
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I'll put an end to it.

77
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,926
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

78
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,128
No, it wasn't!

79
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:52,529
It was so nice
having this little sink here.

80
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,934
''Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

81
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,330
Give me a call
when you get a chance. ''

82
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,131
Bye-bye.

83
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,131
Oh, God!

84
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:15,373
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

85
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:16,806
I've been honing.

86
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:19,651
What was with the dishes?

87
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:22,734
I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant. . .

88
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:26,935
. . .you know, I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here. . .

89
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,206
. . .honing for the last two hours?

90
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,686
The guy with the telescope
is doing it again!

91
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,534
Oh, my God!

92
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,845
Go away!
Stop looking in here!

93
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,326
Great.
Now he's waving back.

94
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,374
We gotta do something about him.

95
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:46,811
I caught him looking
into our apartment.

96
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,530
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff.

97
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,128
What kind of stuff?

98
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:56,929
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff. . .

99
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,650
. . .but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

100
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,045
You cook naked?

101
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,527
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

102
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:12,335
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

103
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:15,929
What's the matter?

104
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,130
I just--
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

105
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,169
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

106
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,965
What about Mindy?

107
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,768
Oh, way better than Mindy.

108
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,575
Not that! I mean,
what about you and Mindy?

109
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,974
Oh. If you want, I'll just
break it off with her.

110
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,925
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

111
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,532
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

112
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,652
Thanks, Bernice.

113
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,728
Let's go away this weekend.

114
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,169
Come on.
This is all way too--

115
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,929
No, we can go to Aruba.

116
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,728
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon. . .

117
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,769
. . .it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

118
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,529
I had a bra.

119
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,806
Hey, Dr. Farber.

120
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,531
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

121
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,496
We're starting to see
some real progress here.

122
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:23,532
What?

123
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,132
I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

124
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,529
Can I use your phone?

125
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,730
For future reference,
that thing in your hand. . .

126
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,733
. . .can also be used as a phone.

127
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,890
Yes, it's working.

128
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,455
Why isn't she calling back?

129
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,449
Maybe she never got your message.

130
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:56,932
You could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps. . .

131
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,206
. . .that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

132
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:01,335
Doesn't that make me seem--?

133
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,612
Desperate? Needy?
Pathetic?

134
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,925
You obviously saw my personal ad.

135
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,692
How many beeps?

136
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,329
She answered.

137
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:17,247
This is where you'd use
that ''hello'' word we talked about.

138
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,530
I won't talk to her.
She obviously got my message. . .

139
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:24,007
. . .and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

140
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,532
God, I miss just being needy!

141
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,569
So how'd he take it?

142
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,126
Pretty well, actually.

143
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,934
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

144
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,569
Oh, do I?

145
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,326
We ended up having sex in his chair.

146
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:49,734
You had sex in his chair?

147
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,936
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't I?

148
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,729
You had what?

149
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,893
Sex in his chair.

150
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,092
What. . . .

151
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,129
What were you thinking?

152
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:11,294
I don't know.
We still care about each other.

153
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,376
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

154
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,127
It's nothing like me and Carol.

155
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:23,170
Please! If she said to you,
''Ross, I want you on this couch. . .

156
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,532
. . .right here, right now,''
what would you say?

157
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,932
If it helps I could slide over.

158
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,736
It's a totally different situation.

159
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:38,053
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians--

160
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,092
I gotta go.

161
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,126
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go!

162
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,533
Do I need a reason?
I have things to do with my life.

163
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,931
I have a jam-packed schedule.

164
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:52,526
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

165
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:06,931
Mindy.

166
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:10,328
How are you?

167
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,564
Yes, I heard. Congratulations!
That is so great!

168
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,727
Really, oh, God--

169
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:20,455
I'm working tomorrow. . .

170
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:23,932
. . .but if you want, you can come by
if you'd like.

171
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:26,731
Great!

172
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,771
So I'll see you tomorrow.

173
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:34,772
Bye.

174
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,134
Oh, God! Oh, God!

175
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,174
So how's Mindy?

176
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,374
She wants to see me tomorrow.

177
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,607
She sounded weird.
I gotta call Barry.

178
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,774
It's me. I just--

179
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:54,772
Mindy!

180
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,165
Mindy!

181
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,488
No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

182
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:18,175
Hell is filled
with people like you.

183
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,768
He's back.
The peeper's back.

184
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,654
-Get down!
-Get down?

185
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,211
And boogie.

186
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:32,526
Thanks, but I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

187
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,289
Relax. She may not even know.

188
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:37,773
I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

189
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,933
I mean, what else is it about?

190
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,092
She was my best friend, you guys.

191
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,934
We went to camp together. . .

192
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,933
. . .she taught me how to kiss. . . .

193
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,574
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman!

194
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,925
I feel so--

195
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,529
Naughty!

196
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,964
-I'll see you guys later.
-I'll walk out with you.

197
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,252
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp. . .

198
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:04,533
. . .and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or--?

199
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,934
That's fine, yeah.

200
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,850
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

201
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,165
Why not take it with you?

202
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,974
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

203
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:18,735
Why don't you just call her?

204
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,968
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

205
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,052
-Do you?
-No!

206
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,609
Danielle, hi!

207
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,772
It's Chandler.

208
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,335
I'm fine.

209
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:37,772
Listen. . . .

210
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:41,525
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, idiot that I am. . .

211
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,931
. . .I accidentally shut off my phone.

212
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,650
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

213
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,530
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

214
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:58,245
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back!

215
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,652
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

216
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:06,652
Mindy.

217
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:07,971
Hey, you.

218
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:09,412
Hey, you.

219
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:14,965
So what's up?

220
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,247
We should really be sitting for this.

221
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,375
Sure we should.

222
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:30,532
So. . . .

223
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,336
Now, I know things have
been weird lately.

224
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,494
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer. . .

225
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,970
. . .who I don't talk to anymore. . .

226
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,650
. . .because she's bitter
that she lost the weight. . .

227
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:43,086
. . .and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

228
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:48,607
I'll just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

229
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,934
Will you be my maid of honor?

230
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:58,772
Of course!

231
00:13:58,976 --> 00:13:59,772
That's so great!

232
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:01,685
It is! It is!

233
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,132
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all!

234
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,649
What?

235
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:11,852
That's not all.

236
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,326
Oh, sure it is!

237
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,328
Oh, no, it isn't!

238
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,251
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

239
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,654
What would make you think that?

240
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,774
Ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

241
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:30,406
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel!

242
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:33,532
Really?

243
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,925
If it'll make you feel any better. . .

244
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:41,452
. . .when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

245
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:43,851
Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.

246
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,570
What's what you were afraid of?

247
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:52,532
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I. . .

248
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:56,365
. . .kind of had
a little thing on the side.

249
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:58,052
What?

250
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,325
I know, I know.

251
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,726
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, ''Don't do it.

252
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,728
He'll do to you
what he did to Rachel. ''

253
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,608
And now I feel so stupid.

254
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,295
You are so stupid.

255
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,727
We are both so stupid.

256
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,125
What do you mean?

257
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,930
Smell familiar?

258
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,569
Oh, I'm so sorry.

259
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,411
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

260
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:31,572
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,535
Oh, my!

262
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:51,131
Four letters, ''circle or hoop. ''

263
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,604
Ring, damn it, ring!

264
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,135
Thanks.

265
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,615
You know our phone's not working?

266
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:00,130
What?

267
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,768
I called from the coffee shop.

268
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:05,729
-There was no answer.
-I turned it off.

269
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,006
Mother of God, I turned it off!

270
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:09,975
Just like you told her you did.

271
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,415
Just pointing out the irony.

272
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,455
I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

273
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:20,284
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

274
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,810
Can I use your phone?

275
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,376
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

276
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,215
''Heating device. ''

277
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:34,371
Radiator.

278
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:35,935
Five letters.

279
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,735
''Rdtor. ''

280
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,928
Yeah, is Sidney there?

281
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:45,972
Oh, this is?

282
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:47,846
Sidney's a woman.

283
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,614
So she's a woman, so what?

284
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:51,968
Yeah, so what?

285
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:56,175
I live across the street, and I know
all about you and your telescope.

286
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,254
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

287
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:01,050
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

288
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:04,249
If I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear. . .

289
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,134
. . .I shouldn't have to feel--

290
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,166
Thank you.

291
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,648
That's not really the point.

292
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,375
The point is, that--

293
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,130
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally--

294
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,976
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

295
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,884
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

296
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,444
The green dress?

297
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:28,492
Really?

298
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,652
She said you looked like
Ingrid Bergman.

299
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:41,733
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

300
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,925
Come on. . .

301
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,292
. . .in.

302
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,054
Hello, sweetheart.

303
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,568
What you guys doing here?

304
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:51,455
We are here to break up with you.

305
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,771
Both of you?

306
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:58,049
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

307
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:02,652
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry!

308
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,171
I'm an idiot! I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.

309
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,294
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

310
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,891
Which one of us
are you talking to there?

311
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:16,931
Mindy.

312
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,650
Of course, Mindy!
It was always Mindy.

313
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,206
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

314
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:25,887
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

315
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,768
Oh, please!

316
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,326
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup!

317
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:32,446
You did it twice?

318
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,931
The first time didn't count.
You know, it was Barry.

319
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,052
Oh, right.

320
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:39,768
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look. . . .

321
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,773
Just give me another chance.

322
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:44,854
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

323
00:18:46,696 --> 00:18:47,924
What do you say?

324
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,776
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

325
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:53,576
Jason Castalano's choking
on his retainer.

326
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,455
Oh, God!
I'll be right there, Bernice.

327
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,732
Look, please don't go anywhere.

328
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,733
I'll be right back.

329
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:05,094
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you!

330
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,006
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

331
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:12,247
If I'm hogging the ball too much,
you jump right in there. . .

332
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,016
. . .and take a couple of punches.
This feels great!

333
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

334
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:22,046
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,969
Mindy, the guy is the devil!

336
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:27,167
He is Satan in a smock!

337
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,693
Look, I know he's not perfect.

338
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,525
But the truth is
at the end of the day. . .

339
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,966
. . .I still really wanna be. . .

340
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:41,333
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber. . .

341
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,927
. . .D.D.S.

342
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:45,730
Oh, God!

343
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:49,653
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

344
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,205
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

345
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,328
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

346
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,729
You okay?

347
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:08,524
Really?

348
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,450
Ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding. . .

349
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,335
. . .I have wondered whether I made
the right choice.

350
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,775
And now I know.

351
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,329
I'm so glad.

352
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,934
Big day.

353
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,647
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

354
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:41,729
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat. . . .

355
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,528
Did you know he's gay?

356
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,530
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

357
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,535
Danielle, hi!

358
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,773
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

359
00:20:58,656 --> 00:20:59,645
Why are you here?

360
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,848
I've been calling you, but it
turns out I had your number wrong.

361
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,168
And when I finally got the right one,
there was no answer.

362
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,453
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

363
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:11,971
I'm okay.

364
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,730
Listen, maybe we
could get together later?

365
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:18,094
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

366
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,725
You got it!

367
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:21,806
Bye, everybody.

368
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,172
There you go.

369
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,094
Second date!

370
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:29,524
I don't know.

371
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,205
You don't know?

372
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,852
She seems nice, but that thing about
her coming all the way here. . .

373
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:38,406
. . .just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,106
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,658
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:11,458
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:14,269
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,300
When somebody steals
your credit card. . .

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,347
. . .they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,259
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:29,863
That's me.

9
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,662
He's doing it again!

10
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,905
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

11
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,379
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

12
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,584
Come here, Marcel!

13
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,059
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'II get him.

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,064
You've got to do something
about the humping.

15
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:50,260
What? It's just a phase.

16
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:53,177
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

17
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,507
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

18
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,899
Marcel, stop it! Marcel!
Bad monkey!

19
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,384
What?

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,185
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

21
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,625
The One With the Fake Monica

22
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:13,898
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,107
Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

24
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,943
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

25
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,859
She's Living my Life,
and she's doing it better than me.

26
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,266
Look at this. Look.

27
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,899
She buys tickets to plays
I want to see.

28
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,341
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

29
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:17,109
She spent $300 on art supplies.

30
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,458
You're not an artist.

31
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,269
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

32
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,348
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

33
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,258
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

34
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,505
Oh, really?
Let's compare, shall we?

35
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:34,661
Oh, it's so late for ''shall we. ''

36
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,785
Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

37
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,662
Do I take classes at The New School?

38
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,868
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,306
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,465
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,228
No, still too ethnic.

42
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,467
My agent thinks I should have
a name that's more neutral.

43
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,545
Joey Switzerland?

44
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,501
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm. . .

45
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,784
. . .this big.

46
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,098
Which I'm not!

47
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,746
Joe, Joe, Joe. . . .
Stalin?

48
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,743
Stalin.

49
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,298
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

50
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,263
Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

51
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:33,458
Joe Stalin.

52
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,061
You know, that's pretty good.

53
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,665
You might want to try Joseph.

54
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,467
Joseph Stalin!

55
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:51,865
-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

56
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,143
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

57
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,659
Joseph Stalin is
The Fiddler on the Roof!.

58
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,863
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

59
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,744
I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

60
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,342
What are you doing?

61
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,858
AII right, great.

62
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,582
Great. Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,861
I'm going to tap class.

64
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,061
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

65
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,504
She's got my Life.
I want to see who she is.

66
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,866
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

67
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,865
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

68
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,583
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

69
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,746
This is madness, I tell you.

70
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,861
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it!

71
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,578
Thank you.

72
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,503
What do you think?

73
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,303
Lots of things.

74
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,547
Which one do you think she is?

75
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,307
-May I help you?
-No, thanks.

76
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,107
We're just here to observe.

77
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,058
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

78
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,265
Spare shoes are over there.

79
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,903
What does she mean?

80
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,940
I think she means, ''You dance. . .

81
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:22,628
. . .a dance class! ''

82
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,547
Come on, come on, come on!

83
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,659
Really?

84
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,103
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

85
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,865
People, last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

86
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,747
Let's not have that happen again!

87
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,061
She could be you.

88
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,824
Let's get started.

89
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,746
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

90
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,581
Okay, I'm not getting this!

91
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,299
I'm totally getting it!

92
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:05,298
Do you ever just feel Like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

93
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,865
What? You just click
when they click.

94
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,018
AII right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

95
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:25,624
AII right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

96
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,577
Great, it's gym class all over again.

97
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,418
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

98
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,459
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

99
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,980
It's okay, it's okay! I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm Late.

100
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,298
Okay, here I am.

101
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,938
So who's the new tense girl?

102
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,498
She's your partner.

103
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,421
Hi, I'm Monica.

104
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,387
Hi, I'm Mon--

105
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,385
Nana.

106
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:04,823
Monana.

107
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,784
It's Dutch.

108
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:11,226
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

109
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,740
Pennsylvania Dutch.

110
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,382
And we're dancing!

111
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,745
Five, six, seven, eight.

112
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,741
-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

113
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,259
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

114
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,261
She says Marcel�s humping
thing is not a phase.

115
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,501
Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

116
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,459
Hey, he beat you!

117
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,859
She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.

118
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,424
What does this mean?

119
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,102
I have to give him up.

120
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:25,548
I can't believe it. This sucks!

121
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,099
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

122
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,307
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing. . .

123
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,228
. . .and before you know it,
he's this Little thing. . .

124
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,465
. . .I can't get off my leg.

125
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,499
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

126
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,701
The vet said that
unless he's in a place. . .

127
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,264
. . .where he has regular access. . .

128
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,065
. . .to some monkey loving. . .

129
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,060
. . .he's just gonna get vicious.

130
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,869
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

131
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,348
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

132
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,467
No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.

133
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,301
We're applying to a Lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

134
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,858
You know, Like San Diego.

135
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:17,625
Right?

136
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,422
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

137
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,747
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

138
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,299
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

139
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:39,903
We found the girl!

140
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,468
-What?
-Did you call the cops?

141
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,142
Nope. We took her to lunch.

142
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,949
Your own brand of vigilante justice.

143
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,221
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

144
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,784
She stole!
She's a stealer!

145
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,463
After you're with this woman
for 1 0 minutes, you forget all that.

146
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,864
I mean, she's this
astounding person. . .

147
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,065
. . .with this amazing spirit!

148
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,261
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

149
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,699
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Volkswagen!

150
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,781
I Love that joke.

151
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,865
-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

152
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,858
It was so wild.

153
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,867
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 61 5. . .

154
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:32,658
. . .only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

155
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,179
So when they caught on that
we were short and have breasts. . . .

156
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,145
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

157
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,307
Go, Monana!

158
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,905
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones Living the dream.

159
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,700
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

160
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:55,983
Oh, by the way. . .

161
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:59,266
. . .tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

162
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,585
Excuse me?

163
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,501
There's an open call for Cats.

164
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,343
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing ''Memories'' . . .

165
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,258
. . .and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

166
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,024
Remember who you're dealing with here.

167
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:18,187
I'm not Like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

168
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,340
That's because of
your Amish background.

169
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,260
You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

170
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,458
Right.

171
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,741
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunt.

172
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:33,102
I was just Like you.

173
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,024
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my Life.

174
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,938
Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?

175
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,818
I thought that movie was
so incredibly. . .

176
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:44,825
. . .boring!

177
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:48,063
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid. . .

178
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,869
. . .kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

179
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,104
What was that?

180
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:56,706
It's Like, ''Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! ''

181
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,462
As I walked out, I thought. . .

182
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:04,947
. . . ''Now that's two hours of my Life
that I'm never getting back! ''

183
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:09,342
And that scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do!

184
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:13,861
Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

185
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,697
Oh, God.

186
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,584
We didn't get into Scranton.

187
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:30,268
That was our safety zoo.

188
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,141
They take, Like, dogs and cows.

189
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,980
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

190
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,502
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

191
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,782
Good boy!

192
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,060
See? How can nobody want him?

193
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,941
Somebody will.

194
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:02,383
You know, there already is
a Joseph Stalin?

195
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:08,498
You're kidding!

196
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:14,784
Apparently, he was a Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

197
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,866
-You'd think you would�ve known that!
-You'd think I would�ve.

198
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,388
Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

199
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:28,542
Flame Boy!

200
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,501
Where exactly is your zoo?

201
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:40,309
Well, it's technically
not a zoo per se.

202
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:44,462
It's more of an interactive-
wildlife experience.

203
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,661
Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it Marcel?

204
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,098
Does he fight with other animals?

205
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,265
No, no. He's very docile.

206
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,583
Even if he were cornered?

207
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,784
Well, I don't know. Why?

208
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,941
How is he at handling small objects?

209
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,663
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

210
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,622
What about a hammer
or a small blade?

211
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,744
Why would he need a blade?

212
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,901
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns. . .

213
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,709
. . .you've got to give
the Little guy something.

214
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,467
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

215
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,339
He got into San Diego!

216
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:32,465
What?

217
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,019
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .

218
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:37,139
He's in!

219
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,462
Did you hear that, Marcel?

220
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,507
It's San Diego! San Diego!

221
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,542
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good. . .

222
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,099
. . .but if you give him to me, I'II
start him against a blind rabbit. . .

223
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,061
. . .and give you 20% of the gate.

224
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,658
Where have you been?

225
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,067
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

226
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,977
Are you drunk?

227
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:19,424
No!

228
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:25,338
I'm Lying.

229
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,705
I am so drunk!

230
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:28,978
Oh, God!

231
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,818
Great. You know what?
You could have called.

232
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,265
I've been up here.
I've been worried--

233
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,306
Water rules!

234
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,260
Yes. Yes, it does.

235
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:51,422
The restaurant called. They want
to know if you're showing up.

236
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,864
Nope!

237
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,499
I'm going to the
Big Apple Circus today.

238
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,498
What are you doing? You're gonna
lose your job. This is not you!

239
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,421
No, it is me!

240
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,661
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows. . .

241
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:07,025
. . .and pay the bills
as soon as they come in!

242
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:11,859
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

243
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,387
I'm Monana!

244
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,544
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second, please.

245
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,740
Monana, it's for you.

246
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,226
The credit card people.

247
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,388
Oh, my God!

248
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:41,818
Thanks.

249
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,865
What?

250
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,785
They've arrested Monica.

251
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,228
How are you?

252
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,863
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue�s my color.

253
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,265
How did you know I was here?

254
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,737
Because. . .

255
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,860
. . .I'm Monica Geller.

256
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:15,943
It was my credit card you were using.

257
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,425
That I was not expecting.

258
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,064
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

259
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,828
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

260
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,504
You have given me so much.

261
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,705
Without you,
I'd have never gotten. . .

262
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,298
. . .to sing ''Memories''
at the Wintergarden Theater.

263
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,540
Actually, you only got
to sing ''Memo--''

264
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,578
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

265
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,258
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

266
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,539
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

267
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,381
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women. . .

268
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:55,668
. . .and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

269
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,379
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

270
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,859
There's nothing to wonder about.

271
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,658
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

272
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,459
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

273
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:12,377
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

274
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,261
I'm not actually Amish.

275
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,858
Really?
Then why are you Like that?

276
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,862
You by the door, in or out?

277
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,745
In!

278
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,146
You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

279
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,141
At least I'm doing it!

280
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,058
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67 to San Diego...

281
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,379
...boarding at gate 42A.

282
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,785
Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.

283
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,020
AII right, I wrote you this poem.

284
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,022
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

285
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,981
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

286
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,826
Okay, bye, champ.

287
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:30,068
There's gonna be a Lot
of babes in San Diego. . .

288
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,187
. . .but remember,
there's also a Lot to learn.

289
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,466
I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.

290
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,258
Just say what you feel.

291
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,622
Marcel, I'm hungry.

292
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,505
That was good.

293
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,859
Marcel, this is for you.

294
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,820
It's just, you know, something. . .

295
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,466
. . .to do on the plane.

296
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,141
If you don't mind, I'd Like
a moment, just me and him.

297
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:10,857
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

298
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,025
Marcel, come here.
Come here.

299
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:19,705
Come here.

300
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:21,862
Well, buddy. . .

301
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,268
. . .this is it.

302
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:28,462
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

303
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,064
I'm really gonna miss you.

304
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,461
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

305
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,058
You've been more than. . .

306
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,867
. . .just a pet to me.

307
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,465
You've been more Like a--

308
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,865
Would you leave my Leg alone?

309
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,061
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

310
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,946
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

311
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:20,908
O, that I were a glove upon
that hand that I might. . .

312
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,901
. . .touch thy cheek!

313
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,703
That's fine. Thank you.

314
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:27,143
Next.

315
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,869
I'II be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

316
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,577
-Name?
-Holden McGroin.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:03,764
-Tell him!
-Please tell him!

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:04,768
Shut up!

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,121
Tell me what?

4
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,685
You won't even look at him.

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:11,646
Come on. I could use another
reason why women won't Look at me.

6
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,041
AII right.

7
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:16,125
Last night, I had a dream. . .

8
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,646
. . .that you and I. . .

9
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,688
. . .were. . . .

10
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,689
Doing it on this table.

11
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,406
Excellent dream score.

12
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:30,849
Why would you dream that?

13
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:33,645
More importantly. . .

14
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,080
. . .was I any good?

15
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,012
Well, you were pretty damn good.

16
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,523
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

17
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,604
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

18
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:53,602
I love it when we share.

19
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:58,248
You okay?

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,609
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream!

21
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,249
I'm sorry.
It was a one-time thing.

22
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:07,649
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

23
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:11,282
The One With the Ick Factor

25
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,006
Hello, Rachel.

26
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,011
Get off!

27
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,609
Oh, give me! Can you see me
operating a drill press?

28
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,003
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

29
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,086
Why would you want to
operate a drill press?

30
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,611
For some short-term work.

31
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:18,042
Till I get back some
of my massage clients.

32
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,805
Pirates again?

33
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,761
No. Nothing like that.

34
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:25,042
I'm just such a dummy.

35
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,852
I taught a ''Massage Yourself
at Home'' workshop.

36
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,605
And they are.

37
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,048
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

38
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,247
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

39
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,051
I could! I could do it!

40
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,321
What is it?

41
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,204
My secretary's gonna be out.

42
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,368
She's having one of her
boobs reduced.

43
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,280
It's a whole big boob story.

44
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,720
I could be a secretary.

45
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,806
I don't know if it's
your kind of thing. . .

46
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,401
. . .because it involves
a lot of being normal. . .

47
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,771
. . .for a large portion of the day.

48
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,810
I could do that.

49
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,362
-What're you playing with?
-My new beeper.

50
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,927
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

51
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,043
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?

52
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,964
Help! They're still extinct!

53
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:13,848
It's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

54
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:17,528
AII she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

55
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,806
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

56
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:22,807
See you later.

57
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,405
Off to see young Ethan?

58
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,211
Thank you.

59
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,606
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

60
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,642
He's our age.

61
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:34,405
When we were. . . .

62
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,604
He's a senior in college.

63
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,967
College?

64
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,206
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

65
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:46,641
No, of course not.

66
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,644
It's not even an issue. . .

67
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,484
. . .because I told him I was 22.

68
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:51,920
-You what?
-What?

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,565
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

70
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,603
Well, maybe 25, 26.

71
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:56,887
I am 26.

72
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,361
There you go.

73
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,011
Can you hear that?

74
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,083
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

75
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,801
Oh, I'm on!

76
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,808
Mr. Bing's office.

77
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,848
I'm sorry he's
in a meeting right now.

78
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm not in a meeting.

79
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,452
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,205
And he has your number?

81
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:40,006
I'II see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye!

82
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,248
Ross says hi.

83
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,406
This is so fun!
What do we do now?

84
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:51,365
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

85
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,204
''Most likely. ''

86
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:59,122
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

87
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,209
AII right. Bye-bye.

88
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,805
Bye-bye.

89
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,048
Yes?

90
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,010
What you doing?

91
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:17,368
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

92
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,767
Belt's too tight.
Gotta change the belt.

93
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:22,850
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

94
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:25,527
Am I out of control?

95
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,645
Just a touch.

96
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,807
Mon, I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since. . .

97
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,047
. . .his midterms.

98
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,602
Why, all of the sudden,
are you so. . .?

99
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:41,608
What?

100
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:45,211
Could tonight be the night?

101
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,650
I don't know. He's a great guy. . .

102
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:53,003
. . .and I Love being with him.
But, you know. . .

103
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,409
. . .things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

104
00:05:58,452 --> 00:05:59,885
So did you shave your legs?

105
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,850
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

106
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,451
It doesn't mean--

107
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,642
This is it! It's baby time.
Baby time!

108
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,326
AII right, relax, just relax.
Be cool.

109
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,209
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

110
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,848
No, Andre is not here.

111
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,162
Third time today.

112
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,210
Yes, I am sure.

113
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,328
I do not perform
those kind of services.

114
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,205
Services?

115
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:35,606
Oh, services.

116
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:39,244
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

117
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,451
That's right.

118
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:47,610
That's right.
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

119
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,251
No, you don't want me.

120
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,609
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

121
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,803
Alrighty, bye-bye.

122
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,209
How was the first day?

123
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,643
Excellent!
Everyone was so, so nice!

124
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,286
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

125
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,288
Me.

126
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,681
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why not?

127
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,610
Well, because, you know.

128
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,005
They don't Like you.

129
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,408
What?

130
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,641
I thought you knew.

131
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,447
Who doesn't Like me?

132
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:29,405
Everyone.

133
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,250
Except for. . . .

134
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,005
No. Everyone.

135
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,045
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,605
Don't feel bad.

137
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,962
You know, they used to
Like you a Lot.

138
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,447
But you got promoted,
and now you're. . .

139
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,802
. . .Mr. Boss Man.
You know, Mr. Big.

140
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,331
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

141
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,161
I can't believe it.

142
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,323
Yeah. They even do you.

143
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,688
They ''do'' me?

144
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,525
You know, Like, okay.

145
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:01,602
''Could that report be any Later?''

146
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,127
I don't sound Like that.

147
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:09,768
Yeah, you do.

148
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,211
''The hills are alive
with the sound. . .

149
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,410
. . .of music. ''

150
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:22,528
''My scone!

151
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,604
My scone! ''

152
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,882
I don't sound Like that.
That is so not true.

153
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,849
That is so not--
That is so not--

154
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,083
That--
Oh, shut up!

155
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,212
-Did not!
-I'm telling you, up until I was 9. . .

156
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:45,091
. . .I thought gunpoint was
a place where crimes happened.

157
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:46,642
How's that possible?

158
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,644
It's always on the news.

159
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,611
''A man is being held up at Gunpoint. ''

160
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:54,007
''Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint. ''

161
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,529
And I kept thinking,
why do people continue to go there?

162
00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:03,927
I should go.

163
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:14,561
-Unless--
-What?

164
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,648
Unless you wanna stay over.

165
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,564
I mean, I'm going to. So. . . .

166
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,208
Yeah, I'd really Like that.

167
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:36,251
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff. . .

168
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,403
. . .there's something you should know.

169
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:42,049
Is this, Like,
''I have an early class tomorrow'' . . .

170
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,806
. . .or ''I'm secretly married
to a goat''?

171
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,762
Well, it's somewhere in between.

172
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:53,011
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not. . . .

173
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,965
Well, I mean, I haven't ever. . . .

174
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,400
Ethan?

175
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,281
Are you a virgin?

176
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:03,651
Well, if that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then. . .

177
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:04,802
. . .yes, I am.

178
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,968
I am. I've kind of been
waiting for the right person.

179
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,000
Really?

180
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,522
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

181
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,411
Wow!

182
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,971
You keep saying that.

183
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,848
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

184
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,607
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man. . .

185
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,406
. . .it is nothing Like that.

186
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,690
Listen, listen.

187
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:51,765
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

188
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,931
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

189
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,210
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

190
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,408
Nothing wrong about that.

191
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,211
Here goes.

192
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,443
I'm not 22.

193
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,207
I'm 25. . .

194
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,771
. . .and 1 3 months.

195
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,001
But I figure that shouldn�t
change anything.

196
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,442
What does it matter how old we are?

197
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,206
Listen. . .

198
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,928
. . .as long as we're
telling stuff. . .

199
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,008
. . .I have another one for you.

200
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,922
I'm a little younger than I said.

201
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,240
You're not a senior?

202
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,403
Oh, I'm a senior. . .

203
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,327
. . .in high school.

204
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,049
What we did was wrong.

205
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,404
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial!

206
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,603
I just had sex.

207
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:18,043
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

208
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,571
You never told me your age.

209
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,807
That's different!

210
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:24,209
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states!

211
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,610
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling--

212
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:29,682
Don't say it!

213
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,847
In Love with you.

214
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,601
Really?

215
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:34,801
Sorry.

216
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,840
Well, fall out of it.

217
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,367
You shouldn�t be here.
It's a school night!

218
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,044
Oh, God!

219
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,442
I'm Like those women
that you see. . .

220
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,001
. . .with shiny guys named Chad.

221
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,804
I'm Joan Collins.

222
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:58,808
Who?

223
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,409
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

224
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,608
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

225
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,643
It's just easier that way.

226
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,647
You told me about the last dream.

227
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,450
No. Forget it.

228
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:27,406
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

229
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,005
AII right. Fine.

230
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,603
You were not the only one there.

231
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,082
Joey was too.

232
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,488
AII right.

233
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,771
Was there. . .

234
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,527
. . .anybody else there?

235
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:50,688
No.

236
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,043
You sure? Nobody. . .

237
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,812
. . .handing out mints or anything?

238
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,250
No, just the three of us.

239
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:03,844
So was it you and Chandler. . .

240
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,367
. . .then you and me
or you, me and Chandler?

241
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,728
-You know what?
-What?

242
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,244
There were times. . .

243
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,403
. . .when it wasn't even me.

244
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:28,202
That is so sweet, you guys!

245
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,091
Mon, Ethan called again.

246
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:43,248
What?

247
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:44,680
Ethan called again.

248
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,445
You're not seeing him anymore?

249
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,005
No.

250
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,447
Sometimes, just things don't work out.

251
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,731
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

252
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,604
I didn't say any--
I did not say anything. I swear.

253
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,001
He stopped by.

254
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,565
Next time you talk to him. . .

255
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:09,208
. . .could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

256
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:15,287
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

257
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:16,686
Sorry.

258
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,691
''It's morphin time! ''

259
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:20,405
-Stegosaurus!
-Tyrannosaurus!

260
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,211
I gotta go.

261
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:28,811
Head rush.

262
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,452
One more, and then I have to go.

263
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,681
Cool.

264
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,168
Where you going?

265
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,528
A birthday party
with some work people.

266
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,211
Work people?

267
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,202
Nobody told me.

268
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,647
No, I know.
That's part of the whole. . .

269
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,167
. . .them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

270
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,204
I don't get it. A month ago,
these people were my friends.

271
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:59,324
Just because I'm in charge,
I'm not a different person.

272
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:04,282
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

273
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,528
-You think I should?
-I really do.

274
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,164
But could we not go together?

275
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,411
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

276
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,611
Last night was great.

277
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:23,401
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory. ''

278
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,286
You were great!
But they still made fun of you.

279
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:27,728
What?

280
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,650
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

281
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,371
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

282
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,166
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy.
Boss Man Bing!

283
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,010
Then I don't get it.

284
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:41,487
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

285
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,047
You're, Like, the guy
in the big office.

286
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,005
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

287
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:48,685
They say you're a great boss.

288
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:49,808
They do?

289
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,441
But they're not
your friends anymore.

290
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,369
-I just want--
-But you can't.

291
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:57,527
But I just want--

292
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:08,888
Are you gonna--

293
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:12,607
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 . . .

294
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,202
. . .it means she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

295
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,567
What about Andre?

296
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,764
He got a call from what I think
was our cousin, Nathan.

297
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,611
Frankly, it was a Little more
than I needed to know.

298
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,331
That was gonna be my opener.

299
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:38,447
Did you guys check out those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

300
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,802
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

301
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,442
Look, I gotta tell you something.

302
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,321
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was cute and vulnerable.

303
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:52,647
I'm actually 30.

304
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,804
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

305
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,652
This is ridiculous.
We are great together!

306
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:03,646
We can talk. We make each other
laugh. And the sex. Oh, man!

307
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,571
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great!

308
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,524
-It was.
-What's the problem?

309
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,003
Ethan, it's. . . .

310
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:16,928
It's icky.

311
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:18,768
''Icky''?

312
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,082
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

313
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,368
This isn't easy for me either.

314
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,051
I wish things were different.

315
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,760
If you were older
or I was younger. . .

316
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:33,486
. . .or we lived in biblical times. . .

317
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:35,248
. . .I could really--

318
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,965
No, don't say it.

319
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,207
Love you.

320
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,803
-Are your hands still wet?
-They're moist.

321
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,604
Let's dry them again.

322
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,802
Or, Like, ''Could these margaritas
be any stronger?''

323
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,047
Hey, Chandler.

324
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,611
Hello, Mr. Bing.

325
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,167
Loved your Stevie Wonder Last night.

326
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,047
Thanks. About the weekly numbers. . .

327
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,760
. . .I'm gonna need them
on my desk by 9:00.

328
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:11,769
-Sure.
-No problem.

329
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,644
You have to give them something.

330
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:20,003
That was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

331
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,043
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

332
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,852
Well, some people are
gonna be working. . .

333
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:26,047
. . .this weekend.

334
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:56,765
Oh, that's nice.

335
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,122
Ross!

336
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm here.

337
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:17,961
You are?

338
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,170
We were just. . . .

339
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:27,768
What?

340
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,690
Great. Now I'm having a baby.

341
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,128
What?

342
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:38,609
I'm having a baby! I'm having a--

343
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,406
-The phone, the phone!
-I don't have the phone.

344
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:46,801
I'm hurt.

345
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:54,411
Monica, let's go!
Come on, people! Woman in Labor!

346
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,122
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.

347
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,122
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital!

348
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,641
I can't Look nice?
There are doctors there.

349
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:07,604
-Joey, get out of the fridge!
-AII right, all right!

350
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:10,249
-What is that?
-For the ride.

351
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,124
-Like in a cab--
-Save it!

352
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:13,128
Hating this.

353
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,288
Monica, come on, now! Let's go!

354
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:16,402
Baby coming!

355
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,041
I can't believe I'm gonna be
an aunt!

356
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,645
I'II have a nephew!

357
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:22,530
That's nice. Get out!

358
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,803
AII right, I'm going.
I'm going.

359
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,008
Here we go. Come on.

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,931
She's not here yet! She's having
my baby and she's not here!

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,892
It's fine.
Has her water broken yet?

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,896
I don't know.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,052
She told me she'd already
passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,371
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,612
What'll you do when
you have a baby?

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,296
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,529
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,532
I don't believe this!
She could be giving birth in the cab!

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,937
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction. . .

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,252
. . .and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,689
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,578
You have to pick your moments.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,414
-Did I miss it?
-She's not even here yet.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,888
What's with the guitar?

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,053
I thought we might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,052
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,410
I wanted a stuffed animal.
Susan wanted a Chunky.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,696
Susan wanted a--
You're having a baby!

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,658
You don't stop for Chunkies!

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,930
I used to have that bumper sticker.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,329
You see what I mean?

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,578

You want this?

Swiss quartz.

Am I allowed to drink anything?

Ice chips.
They're at the nurse's station.

Thought you might Like
some ice chips.

-Thanks.

Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,057
Get up. Come on,
let's get some coffee.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,091
Okay, because we never do that.

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,494
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,336
Or just fall down.
That's good too.

Knick fan?

Listen, lady--

56
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,056
Look!

57
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,495
Look at your man, Ewing.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,931
Nice shot. He couldn�t hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,579
And who do you Like?

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,737
-Celtics.
-Celtics?

61
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,898
They couldn�t hit a boat if--

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,936
Wait. . . .

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,293
They suck, all right?

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,410
Shut up!
It's a rebuilding year--

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,729
Let me get the father!
We need a father over here!

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,732
There's no father.

67
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,290
Oh, sorry.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,376
That's okay. I'm fine.

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,698
Okay. AII right.
Right this way.

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,892
AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,890
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

72
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,655
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,339
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,334
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,538
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

76
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,816
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,934
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

78
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,936
No fair!

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,854
I don't even have one!
How come they get two?

80
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,215
You'll get one.

81
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,776
When?

82
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,695
Tell you what. When we're 40,
and if neither of us are married. . .

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,535
. . .what do you say
we have one together?

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,537
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,693
I just meant hypothetically.

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,773
''Hypothetically,'' why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,690
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,899
Well?

89
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,098
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack!

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,530
Look at you, dressy-dress.

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,493
Did you go home and change?

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,295
It's an important day.
I want to Look nice.

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,651
Has Dr. Franzblau been by. . .?

94
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,209
I haven't seen him.

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,094
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,211
What if the baby needs him?

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,496
What's the deal with you
and doctors?

98
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,099
Is your father a doctor?

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,133
Yeah. Why?

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,489
No reason.

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,530
Mom, we've been through this.

102
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,214
No, I am not calling him.

103
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,293
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk!

104
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,089
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,732
What do you mean, ''Joey who''?

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,095
Joey who?

107
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,298
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

108
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,129
Hold on.

109
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,733
She wants to talk to you.

110
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,333
Take the phone!

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,899
Yeah, it's me.

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,451
We're just friends.

113
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,893
Yeah, I'm single.

114
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,928
Twenty-five.

115
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,695
An actor.

116
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,414
She's not much of a phone person.

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,175
So what's the deal
with this father guy?

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,089
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

119
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,379
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood?

120
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,179
Look, maybe I should just go.

121
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,256
Maybe you should.

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,493
Good luck. . .

123
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,695
. . .and take care.

124
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,578
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
Players run the team.

125
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,895
That is so not true!

126
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,812
-Oh, it is!
-It isn't!

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,772
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,098
You're gonna kill me!

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,539
-Fifteen more seconds! 1 4, 1 3, 1 2--
-Count faster!

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,374
It'll be okay!
Just keep focusing on Jordy!

131
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,649
Who the hell is Jordy?

132
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,336
Your son.

133
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,292
I don't have a son named Jordy.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,411
We all agreed,
my son's name is Jamie.

135
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,015
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend. . .

136
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,693
. . .so we went back to Jordy.

137
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,133
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy!

138
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,811
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse/ Cody/Dillon fiasco.

139
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,576
Cramped leg!

140
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,930
-I got it!
-I got it! I'm doing it!

141
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,455
You get to sleep with her!
I get the cramps!

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,615
No, you don't!

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,890
That is it!
I want both of you out!

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,414
-She started it!
-He did!

145
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,930
I don't care! I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here. . .

146
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,297
. . .and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

147
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,732
-Thanks a lot.
-See what you did?

148
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,493
-Listen--
-Out!

149
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,175
Breathe! Breathe!

150
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,335
What is that?

151
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,536
Something exploded!

152
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,051
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down!

153
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,411
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

154
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,417
Breathe. Breathe.

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,137
Oh, please!
This is so your fault!

156
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,495
How is this my fault?

157
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,931
Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,779
There's a Lot Carol never did
before I came along.

159
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,536
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You are so threatened by me!

160
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,772
Hey! Okay! AII right!

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,459
That's it! Get in here!

162
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,936
My God, you guys!
I don't believe you!

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,092
There are children
coming into the world here. . .

164
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,696
. . .and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should hear!

165
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,295
So just stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,536
Don't make me do this again!
I don't Like my voice Like this!

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,855
Who wants to hear something ironic?

168
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,172
-Help!
-Come on!

169
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,294
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

170
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,779
Everyone stand back.

171
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,416
Are they here yet?

172
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,890
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

173
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,297
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

174
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,091
Anyway, you were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful!

175
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,650
There was this great Little
pastry shop right by my hotel--

176
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,493
There you go, dear.

177
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,016
Come on, Lydia, you can do it!
Push!

178
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,974
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder!

179
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,530
Push him out, push him out!
Way out!

180
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,499
Let's get that ball and really move!

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,689
Let's get--

182
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,895
I was just--

183
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,255
Push, push, push!

184
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,535
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

185
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,740
Help! Help!

186
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,539
And they found their bodies
The very next day

187
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,528
And they found their bodies
The very next--

188
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,216
Mom, everything's going fine.

189
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,893
Ross is great.

190
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,691
He's in a whole other place!

191
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,693
No, he's gone.

192
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,292
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

193
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,929
What do you mean,
''This might be your only chance''?

194
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,937
Would you stop?
I'm only 26.

195
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,899
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

196
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,372
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

197
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,099
Mazel tov!

198
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,337
It could be one hour or three.

199
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,696
But relax.
She's doing great.

200
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,252
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,296
Not at the moment, I'm not.

202
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,495
Are you?

203
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,897
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,899
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

205
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,298
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know. . .

206
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,934
. . .where I do.

207
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,735
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

208
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,210
But it's hard when,
when you do. . .

209
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,297
. . .what I do. It's Like. . . .

210
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,295
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

211
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,899
I'm a waitress.

212
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,416
Aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day. . .

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,689
. . .and you're, Like:

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,494
''If I see one more cup of coffee'' . . . .

215
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,136
Gotcha.

216
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,293
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

217
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,053
How did you know I was here?

218
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,973
Your mom called me.

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,898
So is this her?

220
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,052
No, this is a loaner.

221
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,693
Listen, I'm sorry
you had to do this by yourself.

222
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,970
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
nurse and a helper guy.

223
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,298
So did you see who won the game?

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,493
The Knicks by 1 0.
They suck!

225
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,493
They're not so bad.

226
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,332
Come on! Come on!

227
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,934
Damn it! Damn it!

228
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,410
Damn it, damn it!
This is all your fault!

229
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,009
This should be
the greatest day of my Life!

230
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,694
My son is being born,
and I should be in there!

231
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,095
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you!

232
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,457
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have!

233
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,697
Believe me, no one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

234
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,128
And you know what's funny?

235
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,770
You get to go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

236
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,299
You get to be his father!

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,288
And who am I? There's Father's Day!
There's Mother's Day!

238
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,695
There's no Lesbian Lover Day!

239
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,295
Everyday is Lesbian Lover Day!

240
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,692
This is so great!

241
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,179
Do you wanna explain that?

242
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,937
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left. . .

243
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,809
. . .and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

244
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,496
I barely had enough pieces
of parents to make one whole one.

245
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,091
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents. . .

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,054
. . .who care so much that they fight
over who gets to Love it the most. . .

247
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,296
. . .and it's not even born yet!

248
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,169
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

249
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,691
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

250
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,293
Where are they?

251
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,253
-I'm sure they'll be here soon.
-They wouldn�t miss this.

252
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,090
Relax! You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

253
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,297
You are really frightening me.

254
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,371
Help me!
Trying to rip out my heart!

255
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,294
That's great!
Anybody seen a nipple?

256
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,536
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

257
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,492
AII right, time to start pushing!

258
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,855
But they're not here yet!

259
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,130
I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

260
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,292
Oh, God!

261
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,297
Okay, got the vent open.

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm Ben.

263
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,290
I'm hospital worker Ben.

264
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,618
It's Ben to the rescue!

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,528
Ben, you ready?

266
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,099
Give me your foot.

267
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,054
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

268
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,492
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

269
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,893
What do you see?

270
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,818
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

271
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,129
Wait!

272
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,292
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent!

273
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,890
Pheebs, it's open!
It's open!

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,456
Wait!

275
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,890
You forgot your legs!

276
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,729
Push! Push!

277
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,698
We're here! We're here!

278
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,493
Where have you been?

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,489
Long story, honey.

280
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,611
I need you to keep pushing.
I need--

281
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,572
Excuse me, can I have this?

282
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,738
There's too many people here!
There's about to be one more!

283
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,370
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian Life partner. . .

284
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,729
. . .out you go!

285
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,250
-Bye-bye!
-Good Luck, you guys!

286
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,896
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol�s Lesbian Life partner?

287
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,568
Out!

288
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,975
Here he comes!

289
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,893
Let me see! I've got to see,
I've got to see!

290
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,295
A head!

291
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,209
It's huge!
How are you doing this?

292
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,416
You're not helping!

293
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,338
You're doing great!
You're doing fine!

294
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,411
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry!

295
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,576
What do you see?
What do you see?

296
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,930
We got a head.
We got arms. We got--

297
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,579
Look at the Little fingers!

298
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,098
A chest and a stomach. . .

299
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,649
. . .and it's a boy, definitely a boy!

300
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,976
Legs, knees and feet.

301
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,095
He's here!

302
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,729
He's a person!

303
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,050
-Look at that!
-Who does he Look Like?

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,897
Kind of Like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

305
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,695
Really?

306
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,730
You guys, he's beautiful!

307
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,493
Thanks, Pheebs!

308
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,891
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this Little guy.

309
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,293
How about Ben?

310
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,699
I Like Ben.

311
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,488
Ben.

312
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,694
Ben's good.

313
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,817
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

314
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,488
We just cooked it up.

315
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,491
That's what we were off doing.

316
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,889
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on. Come on.

317
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,493
I know. I know.

318
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,493
Everybody, there's someone
I'd Like you to meet.

319
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,576
This is Ben.

320
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,249
Hi, Ben.

321
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,291
Ben, this is everybody.

322
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,694
Susan, he looks just Like you.

323
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,489
Thanks.

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,297
Oh, God! I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

325
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,889
I know.
I still am one of these.

326
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,889
Can I?

327
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,652
Okay, the head. You gotta. . . .

328
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,339
I'm your Aunt Monica!
Yes, I am!

329
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,491
I'm your Aunt Monica!

330
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,652
I will always have gum.

331
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,695
Ben. . .

332
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,889
. . .I want you to know that
there may be some times when. . .

333
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,892
. . .I may not be around. . .

334
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,692
. . .Like this.

335
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,894
But I'II still always come back. . .

336
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,095
. . .Like this.

337
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,295
And sometimes,
I may be away longer. . .

338
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,888
. . .Like this.

339
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,100
But I'II still always come back. . .

340
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,689
. . .Like this.

341
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,419
And sometimes, I'II want you to steal
third and I'II go Like this.

342
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,297
He is so amazing!

343
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,100
Yeah, I know.
Look at him!

344
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,496
Nothing.

345
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,497
I don't think that's his name.

346
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,494
Look, he's closing his eyes.

347
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,694
Look, he's opening his eyes.

348
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,891
He doesn't do much, does he?

349
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,690
Nope, this is pretty much it.

350
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,898
You guys wanna get some coffee?

351
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,696
I'II see you guys later.

352
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,450
Look, he's closing his eyes again.

00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,743
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,698
Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:11,099
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:14,907
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,946
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,699
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:27,344
Pardon?

8
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:30,507
Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.

9
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:38,859
Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'II pay you back.

00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,741
Yeah, right.

00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,421

12
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,905
. . . 17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,307
Really, I'II pay you back this time.

14
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,899
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,424
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

16
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,186
What kind of research?

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,945
Just, you know, science.

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,301
Science.

19
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,185
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,227
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,106
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

22
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,302
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,784
I just go down there
every other day. . .

24
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,100
. . .and make my contribution
to the project.

25
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,063
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

26
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,902
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

27
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,338
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,617
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,463
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

30
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,747
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

31
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,907
Men are here!

32
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,901
We make fire.

33
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,348
Cook meat.

34
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:45,421
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

35
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,862
Cute, cute!

36
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,343
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

37
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,627
So how are things going?

38
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:54,383
Is she becoming your special someone?

39
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,108
I don't know.
She's pretty great.

40
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,506
What does she think of
your Little science project?

41
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:07,098
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

42
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,307
The man's got a point.

43
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:16,025
The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

44
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,099
Crazy bitch!

45
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,425
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .

46
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,298
. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .

47
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:31,942
. . .if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,224
Joey, we always know what you mean.

49
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,705
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna Last?

50
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,417
I'm going to China.

51
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,425
Jeez, you say one thing and. . . .

52
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,383
You're going to China?

53
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,182
It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

54
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,344
They don't want us
to have the bone.

55
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,627
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

56
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,343
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

57
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:09,901
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,302
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:18,867
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,223
Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,187
I'm your father.

62
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,504
I am The Head!

63
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,300
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

64
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,184
Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I Left.

65
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,504
She's out having drinks with Carl.

66
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,101
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,903
You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:53,141
-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,627
So you do know who he is.

70
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,416
You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,458
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

73
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,420
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

74
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:22,781
Do you guys know who Carl is?

75
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,220
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore. . . .

76
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,103
Rachel�s having
drinks with him tonight.

77
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,822
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

78
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,021
Forget about her.

79
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:41,108
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

80
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,016
Of course, there,
they just call it food.

81
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,946
I guess. I don't know.

82
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,906
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

83
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,504
We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

84
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,423
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

85
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm still on my first.

86
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,060
I just think you're nice.

87
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,737
That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

88
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,908
We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''

89
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,302
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
only with fruit.

90
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,742
-How do you Like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:38,937
Hold on there, tiger.

92
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,182
How are you holding up?

93
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,742
Well, not so good.

94
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,338
She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight. . .

95
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,822
. . .if you know what I--

96
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,343
And you do!

97
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,026
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

98
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:54,901
What do you mean?

99
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,269
You know, just be there for her.

100
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,302
Not following you.

101
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,307
Think about it.

102
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm guessing this is from. . . .

103
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,706
Well, thank you, Melanie.

104
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,105
This one right here is from me.

105
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,708
It's light.

106
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,303
It rattles.

107
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,497
It's. . .

108
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,303
. . .Travel Scrabble!

109
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,504
Thank you.

110
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,937
This one's from Joey.

111
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,661
It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.

112
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,259
And it's a book!

113
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:51,978
It's Dr. Seuss!

114
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,978
That book got me through
some tough times.

115
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,343
There is a Little child
inside this man.

116
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,346
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

117
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,139
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross' .

118
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,502
Oh, my God!

119
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,096
He remembered!

120
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,497
Remembered what?

121
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,137
It was months ago.

122
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,704
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

123
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,420
I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.

124
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,978
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,504
It's so pretty!

127
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,142
This must've cost him a fortune.

128
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,464
I can't believe he did this.

129
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,899
Remember when he
fell in Love with Carol. . .

130
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,499
. . .and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

131
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,703
What did you say?

132
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,148
Crystal duck.

133
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,626
The ''Love'' part?

134
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,701
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,418
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

136
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,500
That'll turn back time.

137
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,264
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

138
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,023
I know.
This is really, really huge!

139
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:49,547
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

140
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,543
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

141
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,376
Is there a mute button
on this woman?

142
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,820
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

143
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,342
Did you have any idea?

144
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,147
No, none!

145
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,426
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out. . .

146
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,102
. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .

147
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:14,307
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

148
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,341
Given that he's desperately
in Love with you. . .

149
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,500
. . .he wouldn�t mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

150
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:21,702
Ross?

151
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,941
AII this time?

152
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,304
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

153
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,663
The country.

154
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,062
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

155
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,385
-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

156
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,623
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

157
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:40,898
What'll you say to him?

158
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't know.

159
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,504
Then maybe you shouldn�t go.

160
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,224
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

161
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,379
But if it's good news,
tell him now.

162
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,067
Maybe I'II know when I see him.

163
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,702
Here, look.
AII right, does this help?

164
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,097
AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

165
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,697
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

166
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,143
I'II see you Later.

167
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,225
I Love you!

168
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,902
Deal with me first!

169
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:26,825
AII right.

170
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,227
Excuse me, pardon me.

171
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,504
Your boarding pass?

172
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,546
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

173
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,537
Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

174
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,785
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

175
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:46,865
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

176
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,942
AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

177
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,587
This is very important.

178
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,019
AII right.
What's the message?

179
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,706
I don't know.

180
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:00,817
Excuse me! Sir!

181
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,342
Excuse me! Sir?

182
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,147
I have a message for you.

183
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,302
Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

184
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,702
What?

185
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,147
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

186
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,788
There's no Rachel!

187
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,100
Don't give me that deep freeze!

188
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:30,697
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

189
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,301
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

190
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,307
It was nothing.

191
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,898
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

192
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,381
You know what?

193
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,979
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

194
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,663
Me, again?

195
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,099
Sure. Why not?

196
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,379
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

197
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:14,546
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.

198
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,658
How do you mean?

199
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:21,099
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, ''Me, me, me! ''

200
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,225
But you. . .

201
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,258
. . .you're a giver.

202
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,943
You're, Like, the most generous
man I ever met.

203
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,419
I mean, you're practically a woman.

204
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,268
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,697
It's only a Little torn.

206
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:45,020
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

207
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,107
I don't know.

208
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,942
I don't know.

209
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,938
I thought about it
all of the way there. . .

210
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,306
. . .and I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .

211
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,140
You know, it's Ross!

212
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,499
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,903
-Sure!
-Sure.

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,907
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling. . .

215
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,701
. . .but I'm thinking. . .

216
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,062
. . .it'd be really great.

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,705
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Like friends-in-law!

218
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,822
The best part is you already
know all about him.

219
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,184
It's Like starting on the 1 5th date.

220
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,698
But it would be Like
starting on the 1 5th date.

221
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,341
Another good point.

222
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,740
At the 1 5th date, you're already
in a ''relationship-py'' place.

223
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:36,943
You're committed.

224
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,504
What happens if it doesn't work out?

225
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,783
Why isn't it working out?

226
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,667
Sometimes it doesn't.

227
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,339
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

228
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,538
No, I'm just--

229
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,148
Maybe there's someone else.

230
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,299
Is there?
Is there someone else?

231
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,109
No, there is no one else.

232
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,908
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

233
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,302
Hey, big--

234
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,625
Spender!

235
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:17,027
She's still asleep.

236
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,577
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

237
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,740
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

238
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:25,339
The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.

239
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,621
Well, Last night
I couldn�t do the thing. . .

240
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,706
. . .that usually makes me great.

241
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,899
So I had to do
all this other stuff.

242
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,106
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

243
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,340
It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!

244
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,658
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

245
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,702
It was amazing,
and not just for her.

246
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:52,745
For me too!

247
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,947
It's Like, all of a sudden
I'm blind. . .

248
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,139
. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.

249
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,899
You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .

250
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,059
. . .on another level.

251
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,864
I didn't know you had
another Level.

252
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,145
I know. Neither did I!

253
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,498
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

254
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,107
-From who?
-From you!

255
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,822
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

256
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,506
Well, it's the thought.

257
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,702
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

258
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,660
At gate 27B?

259
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,139
I've been thinking about it.

260
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,664
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

261
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,664
Why?

262
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,144
Because I feel Like I wouldn�t
just be going out with him.

263
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,504
I would be going out with
all of you.

264
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,148
There'd be all this pressure and--

265
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,106
No pressure, no pressure!

266
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,667
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

267
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,143
I'm not ''so. ''

268
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,504
I was a teensy bit weird at first. . .

269
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,701
. . .but I'II be good.
I promise.

270
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,419
Who is it?

271
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,942
It's me, Carl.

272
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,223
Come on up.

273
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,101
Behind my brother's back?

274
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,223
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

275
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,304
Seven hundred bucks!

276
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,339
AII right, you did it!

277
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,942
Do we have any fruit?

278
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,700
Man! A hell of a two weeks.

279
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,861
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

280
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,583
So you'll stick with this
''it's all for her'' thing?

281
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:51,301
What, are you crazy?

282
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,906
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around Like this?

283
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:04,703
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr. . .

284
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,705
. . .in that stupid electric car. . .

285
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,228
. . .I'II shoot myself!

286
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,340
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se. . .

287
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:15,787
. . .it's just that guy!

288
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,704
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

289
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,307
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

290
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,859
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

291
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,338
Can't do it, can you?

292
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,338
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

293
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:37,625
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

294
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,057
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

295
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,267
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

296
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,541
Rachel, come on.

297
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,700
Give us a chance.

298
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,902
It's too hard.

299
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,346
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

300
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,545
Who cares?
This is about us.

301
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,105
I've been in Love with you
since the ninth grade.

302
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,909
-You're, Like, my best friend.
-I know.

303
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,861
If we broke up, and I lost you--

304
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,787
Why do you think
we'll break up?

305
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,703
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

306
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:14,984
No.

307
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,503
But it only has to happen once.

308
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,747
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

309
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:23,943
Right?

310
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,740
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

311
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,017
I don't know.

312
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,906
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

313
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,188
Well start Looking!

314
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,617
Exactly!

315
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,705
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy. . .

316
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:55,701
. . .caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

317
00:19:58,189 --> 00:19:59,337
Right!

318
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,738
You're right!

319
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,544
You know what?

320
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,986
I forgot, I need to pick up
a friend at the airport.

321
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,144
I am so sorry!

322
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:11,506
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

323
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,176
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!

324
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,583
But. . . .

325
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,065
Excuse me! Pardon me!

326
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,098
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,538
Toby. . .

328
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,700
. . .for God's sake,
will you Let it go?

329
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,540
There's no Rachel!

330
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:40,903
I got that!

331
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,505
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

332
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,699
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends!

333
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,548
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

334
