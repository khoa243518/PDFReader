00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,599
 They have a neighbour, Nick.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,358
 Nick fancies Bridget.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,359
 But Annie fancies Nick.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 That's the way it is
 until Bridget gets a letter from Argentina.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Is he stupid?

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 I told you...

9
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,919
 Sorry. B.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
 Yes, John?

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 Yes, I got the cards
 and the flowers and the chocolates.

12
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,799
 Yes. And I got the cushion as well.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,038
 But it's finished. Sorry.

14
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,959
 But please don't leave me.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,399
 -  Don't cry.
 -  I love you so much.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,238
 Goodbye.

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
 Oh, and happy birthday.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 Ah, men!

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 Come on, Charley. Come on.

20
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 Post, Bridget. Charley and I have the post,
 haven't we, Charley?

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,439
 Give me the post, Charley.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 Give me the post, Charley.

23
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,919
 Drop it, Charley.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Oh, good boy!

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 What's this?

27
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,959
 A parcel for you, Bridget.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 Good. What is it?

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 Oh, it's from Mother.

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,919
 'Bridget darling, this arrived for you
 and I made you this.

31
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,399
 'Love, Mummy.'

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
 Oh, very you, Bridget.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,878
 Mother!

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,879
 Ooh, this is from Argentina.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,558
 Argentina? Who from? What does it say?

36
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,559
 Erm, it says, 'Hello, do you remember me?'

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
 No.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 'Seven years ago we was penpals.

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
 'We was...' We were penpals.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
 Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's Hector.

41
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,078
 Who's Hector?

42
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
 He was my penpal seven years ago.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
 Oh.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,598
 'I speak English good now...'

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,599
 I speak English good.
 I speak English well now...

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,278
 '..and I am coming to England.'

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,279
 Ooh, Latin Americans!

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 'I would like to sleep with you.'

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
 'Do you have a bed for me?'

50
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,039
 Oh, he wants to stay here.

51
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,919
 But, erm, what about the rules?

52
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,919
 Ooh, a Latin American here.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,919
 Ooh, like Ricky Martin!

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 -  Tall, handsome...
 -  Rich.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
 So, erm, when is he coming?

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 Oh, erm, let me see. It says...November 5th.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 Oh, November 5th. But that's...

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 Today!

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,798
 Oh, it's you, Nick.

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,558
 Hi, babes!

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,559
 -  Hello, Nick. How are you?
 -  Great.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,758
 Nice muscles.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,759
 -  Here's your milk.
 -  Our milk?

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 You mean our milk
 you borrowed three weeks ago.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,319
 Oh, thanks, Nick.

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 I forget nothing!

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,119
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,319
 -  Uh- huh?
 -  I said, 'Would you like a drink, Nick?'

70
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,359
 Oh! Sorry.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 No, thanks.

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, erm, Bridget's friend is coming.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 -  Oh, yeah?
 -  Uh- huh. From Argentina.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,799
 Wow! From Argentina!

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,039
 -  What's she like?
 -  She is a he.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 -  Huh?
 -  Not a girl, a boy.

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
 Tough guy, eh?

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Why don't I show you how to do it properly?

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
 Nick, I've told you before,
 nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

80
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,359
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 If you touch my bike again, you are out.
 O- U- T, out. Clear?

82
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,239
 What?

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 I said...

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,878
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,358
 You mean, 'I am called Hector.'

87
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,398
 You are called Hector?

88
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,078
 Oh, no, no, no. I am called Annie.

89
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,638
 I am called Annie.

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,639
 No. She means, 'I am called Hector.
 I am from Argentina.'

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
 You are from Argentina?

92
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
 Come in.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Hello.

94
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,079
 -  Hi, babes!
 -  Hello, Nick.

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
 I forget nothing.

96
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
 Nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 My cars.

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,919
 You play with cars?

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Yes. You play...no.

102
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,359
 I play with cars.

103
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,638
 He plays with cars.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,639
 I read. I love the library.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,999
 Fascinating.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We go to the library too, don't we, Bridget?

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
 Yes, it's great.

108
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,759
 Good.

109
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,799
 I live here.

110
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
 You live in a museum, full of old things?

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 Old things? Yes, I have lots of old things.

112
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,439
 I live in a museum.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
 OK, I live in a museum.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Well, thank you, Hector.
 And now we'll show you the flat.

115
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
 This is the bedroom.

116
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,759
 Thank you.

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,119
 Who- hey!

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,479
 Where do you sleep?

119
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 Er, no, you don't understand.
 We only have one bedroom.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
 One? I have 20.

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,518
 20?

122
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
 Yes, he lives in a museum, with 20 bedrooms.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Oh! Very funny, 20 bedrooms.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 Well, you can sleep here.

125
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,799
 Oh, thank you.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 -  Oh, no, no, no, Hector.
 -  Uh?

127
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
 It's a bed.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,638
 A bed? Oh, wow...

129
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,598
 Oh...

130
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,358
 -  Here's a cushion.
 -  Oh, thank you.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,359
 Oh, this of course is the TV.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 But just relax. I must go to the bathroom.

133
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,119
 Psst! Annie! Bathroom!

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 Now!

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,159
 Oh, my goodness. What are we going to do?

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,278
 He plays with toy cars.

137
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
 He is not a sexy Argentinian.

138
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,478
 But he is sweet.

139
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,479
 And he is polite.

140
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,198
 But those clothes!

141
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,199
 He is so old- fashioned.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 He must go.

143
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,239
 Room service.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,199
 Hello. Who are you?

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 -  Oh. You are quick. Good.
 -  Eh?

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 -  My luggage is downstairs.
 -  What?

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,199
 -  Bring it up, please.
 -  What are you doing?

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,879
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

149
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,758
 The butler?

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,759
 I am Nick. I live next door.

151
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,598
 I am Hector.

152
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,599
 Oh, Hector, from Argentina.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Yes, from Argentina.

154
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,079
 Where are the girls?

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,679
 -  The girls?
 -  Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,399
 Oh, they live here.

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Yeah, I know. Where's Bridget?
 Does she know you are here?

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 Bridget, she gave me this.

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 Hello, Nick. Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,638
 Yeah, I know.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,438
 -  Isn't he wonderful?
 -  Wonderful.

162
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,918
 -  Are you hungry?
 -  Uh?

163
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,919
 We'll buy your lunch.
 What would you like to eat?

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 -  Fish and chips?
 -  Oh, fish and ships!

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 Erm, Nick, Hector, make friends?

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 Nick, teach Hector some English.

167
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,638
 Yeah, OK.

168
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 I'll teach Hector some English.

169
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,359
 Oh, you are quick. Good.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

171
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,999
 The butler?

172
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 She gave me this.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 I'll teach Hector some English.

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 OK...this is the oven.

175
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,198
 This is the oven.

176
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

177
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So you say, 'Annie, the dog is in the oven.'

179
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
 Annie, the dog is in the oven.

180
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,718
 Great! Now Bridget.

181
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,719
 -  Oh. Oh, dear.
 -  Huh?

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Well, Bridget likes strong men,
 especially strong legs.

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,318
 I am strong.

184
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,319
 Yeah? Can you cycle 50 kilometres?

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,078
 -  Yes.
 -  No way.

186
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,798
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, go on, then, show me.

187
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,799
 Yes, look.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 Adios, amigo.

189
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
 Ah. Bridget, Annie, lunch.

190
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,678
 Fish and chips.

191
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,679
 Yes, lunch, Hector.

192
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
 Look, Bridget, 50 kilometres.

193
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 What?

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,359
 Hi. Everything OK?

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 Great!

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I am... How do you say? Erm...

198
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,039
 -  Dead.
 -  Hot.

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,999
 Hot. Yeah, I am hot. I need a...

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 -  Shower.
 -  Yeah, I need a shower.

201
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,119
 -  Be my guest.
 -  Oh, thank you.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,519
 Right, that's it. He must go.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,238
 Why? He is so nice.

204
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,759
 He used my bike.

205
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 Yeah, and he said that the dog was in the oven.
 What a horrible joke.

206
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Where is Charley? Charley!

207
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 -  What a bad, bad boy.
 -  He must go.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 -  Can he stay with you, Nick?
 -  Uh- uh. Sorry, ladies.

209
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 -  Oh, please, Nick. You have a spare room.
 -  No way. Not my problem.

210
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,039
 -  He must go now.
 -  But he's in the shower.

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 I don't care.

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
 Hector, please come out,
 we want to talk to you.

213
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 I like fish and chips, I...

214
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,998
 Hector, please come out, we want to talk to you.

215
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,358
 OK, one moment, please.

216
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,198
 I like fish and chips...

217
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,199
 Yes, you want me?

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 -  We think...
 -  We...

219
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 We...we have a problem.

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
 It's like this.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 Go on, then, tell him.

222
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,518
 Yes, Bridget?

223
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,519
 Hector, the thing is...

224
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,199
 Stay there. I'll talk to him.

225
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,239
 Hector, can I have a word, please?

226
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Ricky Martin!

227
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Hector, is this you?

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 Yes, and my parents.

229
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 'The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.'

230
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,639
 Who are these?

231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 My...

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 -  Servants.
 -  Yeah, my servants.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
 -  Your cars?
 -  Yeah, my cars.

234
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Hector, you are rich.

235
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,238
 Why stay here?

236
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 I want friends. Good friends.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 People like you for your money?

238
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
 That's awful.

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Erm... Listen, keep it a secret.

240
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,359
 -  OK.
 -  OK.

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 Perhaps he could stay here.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 Yes. Poor boy.

243
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,439
 Hector, come and stay with me.
 I have two rooms.

244
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 -  Shut up, Nick.
 -  Hector will stay with us, won't you, Hector?

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Hector, come and...sit down.

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hector, please, call me Gigi.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
 Oh, Charley, there you are.

248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

249
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
 The oven?

250
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 Yes. Nick is a good English teacher.

251
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,239
 Yes, a very good English teacher.

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 -  I'd love to see your photos again.
 -  Oh, me too.

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Oh, your sweet toy cars!

254
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,718
 They are not toys.

255
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,719
 Today Hector arrives and it's Bonfire Night.

256
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,118
 Let's party!

257
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,119
 -  What sort of music do you like?
 -  Music?

258
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,399
 Yeah, music. You know, soul, funk, dance.

259
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 Watch me. Like this.

260
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
 Interesting.

261
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,759
 I dance...like this.

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 I'll get it. I'll get it.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,318
 Hello.

264
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,319
 Oh, yeah, that's great.

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 Sure. Come up.

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,398
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  The tarantula!

267
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,399
 -  Quick, hide, Hector.
 -  I'm off. I owe two weeks' rent.

268
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,398
 Next time in Extra...

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,238
 The flatmates go shopping for Hector.

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,238
 Hector goes shopping for the girls.

271
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,239
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

272
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,199
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,800
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,040
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,199
 Bridget has a job with Channel 9

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 and so does Hector, he's a reporter.

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,679
 Annie just wants to save the animals

6
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,199
 and Nick... Well, Nick is Nick.

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,399
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,998
 What?

9
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,999
 -  Nick!
 -  Who is it?

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,518
 It's me. Annie.

11
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,519
 And this is Ziggy.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,558
 -  Is Hector there?
 -  No.

13
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,559
 -  He's working tonight.
 -  Then you must help us, Nick.

14
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,519
 Take these.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 They are my babies,
 so look after them, please!

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,838
 Sure, no problem.

17
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,918
 Right. Ready, Ziggy?

18
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,919
 Come on, let's go.

19
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,159
 Hurry!

20
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,679
 Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 Bye.

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,319
 'Animals are human?'

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,319
 Annie, animals are animals.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 -  But animals are like people.
 -  Really, Annie?

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,438
 Look at this flat. How can I get ready?

26
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,439
 -  Sorry, Bridget.
 -  I have a very important day today.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 -  Sorry.
 -  I have big, big decisions to make.

28
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,439
 Like...which dress.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,199
 What do you think?

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,119
 They're both nice.

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,278
 I have such a busy morning.

32
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,279
 David Beckham, Madonna.

33
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,359
 What? You're meeting them?

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 No, I'm reading about them

35
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,239
 and then I'm having lunch with guess who.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,359
 Yes, you've guessed it.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Leonardo DiCaprio!

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 Leonardo and me!

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
 Wow! Leonardo DiCaprio?

40
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,679
 Just you and him?

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,399
 Well, nearly.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 There'll be 45 journalists there too

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,759
 but really it's just me and gorgeous Leo.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,480
 You and 45 others?

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,118
 I see.

46
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:50,119
 Anyway, this cosmetic factory
 experiments on animals for make- up

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,680
 and I really feel...

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
 Good, Hector, you're here.
 Now you can help me choose.

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,599
 You're back, Hector.

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Was it a difficult night at work,
 snuggly puppykins?

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,240
 Yes, and the bad news is
 that Eunice wants me to go straight back.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,799
 Why?

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 There is a big news story happening today.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,239
 So, Hector,

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
 which dress do you like the best?

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,879
 This one.

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,880
 -  You're sure?
 -  OK, that one.

58
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,238
 But you just said this one first.

59
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,599
 Yes, I know, but...

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 Bridget, I am going to Channel 9 now.

61
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,439
 -  Are you coming?
 -  Yes, Hector.

62
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 And I can tell you
 all about Leonardo and me!

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 The guinea pigs!

64
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,919
 Nick?

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
 Good. They're OK.

66
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 I'm coming.

67
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,119
 Ziggy, come in.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,038
 Right, now, there are the posters.

69
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,039
 Now, a note for Nick.

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
 Ready, Ziggy?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Bye, Charley. Wish us luck.

72
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,119
 Wait a minute, Ziggy.

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 OK, right, let's go.

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
 Wish us luck.

75
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,399
 Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

76
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,759
 Bye.

77
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,679
 Leonardo and me!

78
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,518
 Wow!

79
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,519
 Leonardo DiCaprio?

80
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,159
 I have big, big decisions to make.

81
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 Which dress?

82
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,559
 Hector. At last.

83
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 I want you to go
 straight to Garrier's cosmetic factory.

84
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,639
 Why?

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 Because some horrid hippies
 are protesting there.

86
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,959
 Why?

87
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Because they think Mr Garrier
 experiments on guinea pigs for make- up.

88
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,678
 This is nonsense.

89
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,079
 Guinea pigs?

90
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,119
 You know,

91
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
 guinea pigs.

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,638
 Guinea pigs! How sweet.

93
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,639
 And these hippies
 have stolen his guinea pigs.

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 Poor Mr Garrier adores his little guinea pigs.

95
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:20,359
 He wants them back.

96
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,279
 He told me over dinner last night.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,638
 Who is Mr Garrier?

98
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,639
 Mr Garrier owns Channel 9.

99
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,279
 And Mr Garrier has said

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
 we must make these protesters
 look very, very stupid.

101
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,038
 Now get going!

102
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,518
 OK, Eunice.

103
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,519
 I want their heads!

104
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,039
 Eunice?

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,198
 Yes, Bridget?

106
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,199
 Is there anything I can do?

107
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,919
 Yes.

108
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 I have a very important job for you.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Get me a coffee. Black, no sugar.

110
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,839
 No, Bridget.

111
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
 I can't, I'm a married man.

112
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,039
 What?

113
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,838
 Crazy, man!

114
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,798
 Guinea pigs!

115
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,799
 They are my babies,
 so look after them, please.

116
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,560
 Yeah, sure, no problem.

117
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,958
 Yeah.

118
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,198
 Annie.

119
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,039
 Annie!

120
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 OK, my little beauties.

121
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 Time for breakfast.

122
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,479
 Come on.

123
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 'Nick, very important. Keep my babies safe.
 I will call you. Annie.'

124
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,518
 Does she think I'm stupid?

125
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,519
 Of course you're safe with me.

126
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 Now, let me introduce myself.

127
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,278
 My name is Nick.

128
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,439
 Yeah, hello there.

129
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
 Now, what's your name?

130
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,479
 Kevin? How do you do, Kevin?

131
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,838
 And who's this?

132
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,518
 Janice?

133
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,519
 Is she your girlfriend, Kevin?

134
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,439
 OK, it's not that funny.

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 Janice, I think you're very pretty, OK?

136
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,879
 So!

137
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,319
 These are all your friends.

138
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,718
 Wow!

139
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,719
 There are eight of you.

140
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,438
 You must be hungry.

141
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,439
 Shall Uncle Nick get you
 something nice to eat?

142
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,119
 OK.

143
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,319
 Have they split up?

144
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 Hollywood's most beautiful couple.

145
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,599
 Yes!

146
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,639
 Yes!

147
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,799
 Garrier out! Garrier out!

148
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
 All right, Eunice, I cannot hear you.

149
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,238
 I said,

150
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,438
 find the leader.

151
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,439
 The what?

152
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,438
 The coordinator.

153
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,878
 Which one?

154
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,359
 Her, her! That one!

155
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 The one with the big ears.

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
 Garrier out! Garrier out!

157
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,918
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

158
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,919
 This isn't a tea party. Ask her a question.

159
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,919
 OK.

160
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
 So how important is this protest?

161
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,398
 Well...

162
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,159
 Well, yes, it's very important

163
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
 because this factory, Garrier's,
 experiments on animals for make- up.

164
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,319
 And why is that bad?

165
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,479
 Because the poor...

166
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 Because the poor animals are suffering.

167
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,119
 That's dreadful. The poor things.

168
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 Poor little things.

169
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,399
 They're just guinea pigs!

170
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,639
 Hector, remember who Mr Garrier is?

171
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,639
 You do want your job.

172
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,638
 OK, OK.

173
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,639
 OK, so do you think
 this march will help the animals?

174
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,639
 It's Hector and Annie.

175
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,078
 -  This march is important.
 -  Wow, man!

176
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,079
 We must stop Mr Garrier!

177
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,518
 I see.

178
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,519
 These scientists are using poor animals
 to test on hair dye,

179
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 lipstick, mascara, blusher.

180
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,278
 They use...

181
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,279
 Well, tell her. Tell her...we need make- up!

182
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,919
 And where are the eight guinea pigs
 they stole from the laboratory?

183
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,958
 I bet she knows. Ask her.

184
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,559
 Ask her.

185
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,319
 OK.

186
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
 And do you know anything
 about...some stolen guinea pigs?

187
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 The guinea pigs are safe.

188
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 Yeah, they're safe with me.

189
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,079
 Aren't you, my pretty ones?

190
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,919
 I bet she's got those guinea pigs.

191
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 -  Ask her! Ask her!
 -  OK.

192
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,759
 Have you...

193
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 Louder, you idiot!

194
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Have you got...

195
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,319
 We've got her! Ask her again! Ask her again!

196
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 Have you got the guinea pigs?

197
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,798
 Hector, why are you doing this?

198
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,039
 You know I love animals.

199
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 I'm sorry, Annie. It's my job.

200
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,159
 Well, you can keep your job!

201
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 Annie, please! Wait, I'm coming!

202
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,280
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

203
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,999
 Annie, please! I can explain.

204
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,279
 Wait!

205
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,879
 OK, my little beauties.

206
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,519
 They're safe with me.

207
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
 Aren't you, my pretty ones?

208
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
 Have you got the guinea pigs?

209
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 Hector, why are you doing this?

210
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,719
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

211
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,399
 Annie, please, I can explain. Wait!

212
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,839
 Bridget DiCaprio.

213
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 Mrs Leonardo DiCaprio.

214
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 Leonardo and Bridget DiCaprio.

215
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,638
 'Hello, Mrs DiCaprio!'

216
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,639
 'Call me Bridget.'

217
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,319
 'Is Leonardo there?'

218
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,719
 'No,

219
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 'he's on the beach with
 our two beautiful children and the dogs.'

220
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,639
 Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

221
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,279
 So aren't you going to ask me
 about my lunch?

222
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 -  What did you do that for?
 -  Aren't you going to ask me about my lunch?

223
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,159
 -  What lunch?
 -  My lunch with Leonardo.

224
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,879
 Leonardo who?

225
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
 Leonardo DiCaprio, of course.

226
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 So, Bridget, how was your lunch
 with Leonardo DiCaprio?

227
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,839
 Gorgeous!

228
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,279
 I was so funny.

229
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
 He loved me, he loved my dress,
 he loved my name.

230
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,079
 -  That's nice.
 -  Now close your eyes.

231
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,479
 Go on, close your eyes.

232
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 Ready?

233
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,719
 What do you think?

234
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 -  Very nice.
 -  It was very expensive

235
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 but it's worth it
 because tonight I'm going to a premiere.

236
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,199
 I can't wait!

237
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
 I wonder if Leonardo will be there.
 Now I must get ready.

238
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,359
 Tonight this little lady's going to shine

239
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,679
 Tonight this little lady's going to shine

240
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,319
 Annie, I can explain. Listen.

241
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,759
 Annie, please talk to me.

242
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,080
 Hey, guys. Great interview.

243
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,839
 You were not fair, Hector.

244
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,840
 -  You were asking awful questions.
 -  Yeah, they were pretty bad.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,678
 It wasn't me.

246
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,679
 It was Eunice.

247
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,278
 The guinea pigs!

248
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,279
 Nick, where are they?
 I must take them to the animal sanctuary.

249
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,039
 We've been having a lovely time,
 haven't we, my friends?

250
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 Hello. They're not here.

251
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,279
 What do you mean, they're not here?

252
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 I mean, they're not here.

253
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
 So where are they, Nick?

254
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,039
 Everywhere?

255
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,559
 I'll get it.

256
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,479
 Hello.

257
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
 Hi, Eunice.

258
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 Yes, Eunice.

259
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,438
 OK, Eunice.

260
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,079
 No, Eunice.

261
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 OK, Eunice. Bye, Eunice.

262
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:30,118
 -  It was Eunice!
 -  No!

263
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,119
 And after what happened today,

264
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,238
 she says that I...

265
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,558
 Hector!

266
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:37,559
 Your job! She's fired you!

267
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,759
 I'm so sorry, Hector.

268
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,998
 It's all my fault.

269
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,999
 She says that I must tell you

270
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,559
 that she is so pleased with the interview,

271
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 she wants Channel 9
 to fight against animal cruelty.

272
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,759
 Channel 9's new motto is...

273
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 Animals are human.

274
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,599
 That's fantastic news!

275
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 Good old Eunice.

276
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,638
 What about Mr Garrier?

277
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,639
 She said, 'Don't worry about Mr Garrier.'

278
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 -  Right, let's find those guinea pigs.
 -  Yes, right away.

279
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,079
 Right, we've found seven of them.

280
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,998
 There's just one guinea pig still missing.

281
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,639
 He's probably watching us.

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,640
 Yeah, and laughing at us.

283
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,958
 Hello?

284
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,959
 OK, right.

285
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,279
 -  Bridget, your taxi's here.
 -  I'm coming.

286
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 New girlfriend, Nick?

287
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,719
 Right, everyone,

288
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,679
 I'm just off to my premiere.

289
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,478
 Did I mention it?

290
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,519
 Proper acting.

291
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 Perhaps you could learn something, Nick.

292
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,599
 Sorry.

293
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,798
 No spare ticket.

294
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,799
 Still, I'll tell you all about it later.

295
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
 Bye.

296
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
 Don't wait up.

297
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,559
 Next time in Extra...

298
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
 The friends go on holiday to Spain.

299
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,679
 Bridget finds her prince.

300
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,438
 And Nick finds his princess.

301
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:37,438
 And Nick finds his princess.

1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,840
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
 Hector works as a reporter on Channel 9

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,079
 and is going out with Annie.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,359
 Bridget works at Channel 9 as well

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,319
 but is not going out with Nick.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,919
 They all need a holiday.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,999
 'Who would be your ideal holiday romance?

10
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,078
 'A) J.Lo...

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,559
 'B) Cameron Diaz...

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
 'or C) Kylie?'

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 Difficult to choose.

14
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,879
 All three!

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,759
 'What do you like most about girls on holiday?

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
 'A) Their suntans...'

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,238
 Yeah, OK.

18
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,239
 'B) Their bikinis...'

19
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,598
 Yeah!

20
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,399
 'C) Their...'

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 Ironing skills?

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
 'Where do you meet girls on holiday?

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,919
 'A) On the beach...

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,959
 'B) In the bar...

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
 'C) On the ski slope?'

26
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,839
 On the beach...

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
 Yeah, I meet lots of lovely girls
 on the beach.

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 Oh, Nick... Oh, Nick... Nick ...

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,399
 Nick!

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,238
 Nick!

31
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,239
 Nick...

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,039
 Nick, I am fed up.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,038
 I need a holiday.

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,519
 We all need a holiday.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,199
 I'm exhausted.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
 So, it is holiday time again

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 and everyone is off to the airport.

39
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,918
 Hello, Hector.

40
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,919
 They are travelling to Florida,
 Thailand, Egypt and...Belgium?

41
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
 Are you sure?And Belgium.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 Travelling by plane, by train and by car.

43
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,439
 Well, maybe not by car.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
 This is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,680
 Bridget will be furious.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Still, maybe a new fashion.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,039
 Yes, yes.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 Can he do the interview on Thursday?

49
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,958
 No. Well, what about Friday?

50
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,518
 Hang on.

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,038
 Hello.

52
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,838
 She wants 22 dressing rooms?

53
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,839
 Four for Lourdes and her nannies?

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,758
 But we've only got two.

55
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,719
 Hello?

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,599
 For goodness' sake!

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 Who wants Madonna anyway?

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 Hello, are you still there?

59
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,879
 Hello! What?

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,958
 Hello, Eunice.

61
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,959
 Yes, David Beckham is booked
 and so is Princess Caroline of Monaco.

62
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,959
 No, Madonna is not coming.

63
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,919
 Yes, OK, Eunice, I will.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,879
 I will, today.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,559
 Bye, Eunice.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 What did your last slave die of?

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 What I need, what I really need is a holiday.

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 Go on, type New York.

69
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,638
 Gatwick.

70
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Number of nights -  three.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,718
 Three.

72
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,719
 OK, let's see what they can do.

73
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,518
 £1,000?

74
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,719
 That's much too expensive.

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,118
 We must choose a different destination.

76
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,958
 Yeah...

77
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,999
 How about Las Vegas?

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But that would cost even more.
 Don't be silly, Nick.

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 What? Is Nick being silly? I don't believe it.

80
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,079
 I'm so tired.

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 Hector, I saw your holiday report.

82
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,799
 I have just spent all day

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 watching other people go on holidays.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
 I can't go on!

85
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,158
 Eunice is a witch.

86
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,158
 She makes me work, work, work.

87
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,518
 -  Why don't you leave, then?
 -  Yeah.

88
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,918
 What? Leave my job?

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,519
 I love my job.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,318
 Women!

91
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,319
 What you need... What we all need is a...

92
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,759
 Holiday!

93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,879
 A holiday!

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,959
 Great idea!

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,318
 Where shall we go?

96
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,319
 I'd love to go to Las Vegas.

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,719
 Cape Town.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 I'd like to go anywhere with Enrique Iglesias.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 What about Spain?

100
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,399
 You speak Spanish.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 -  You can be our guide.
 -  Well...

102
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,959
 Enrique Iglesias speaks Spanish.

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 And the girls!

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,238
 I can't wait!

105
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,239
 Hey, Hector,
 you can translate my chat- up lines.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 Well, I'll try.

107
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,919
 And we can try them out.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 Yeah!

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,599
 Hector.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 There's your ironing.

111
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,478
 Nick.

112
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,479
 There's yours.

113
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 I need a holiday.

114
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
 Where shall we go?

115
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,198
 And the girls!

116
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,199
 I can't wait!

117
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 OK, I see a pretty Spanish girl...

118
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,918
 How do I say...

119
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,919
 'I'm English. Can you
 give me directions...to your apartment?'

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,599
 -  Really?
 -  Yeah.

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
 OK.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 Good, but this one is better.

123
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,559
 Your eyes are like stars.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
 They come out at night.

125
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,278
 I like it!

126
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,279
 How do I say it in Spanish?

127
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
 -  That's what I said.
 -  OK.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 Now, this one always works.

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 I know what you're thinking.

130
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,598
 You want to kiss me, don't you?

131
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,199
 No, I don't.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 Not you! It's the chat- up line, stupid.

133
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,038
 Hector, are you there?

134
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,039
 Yeah.

135
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,559
 Could you give me a hand with my luggage?

136
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
 Sure.

137
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,439
 All of it?

138
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 Yes, all of it, please, Hector.

139
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 Over here, Hector. I must do a final check.

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
 Good gracious, Bridget.
 What have you got in there?

141
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
 Six T- shirts,
 three pairs of jeans, four pairs of trousers,

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
 ten bikinis, four sarongs, two skirts,

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 two nightdresses, three pairs of trainers,
 two pairs of evening shoes,

144
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,479
 three toothbrushes, two toilet bags,
 five belts, two jackets,

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
 two cans of hair mousse and a ball gown.

146
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,718
 But we're only going for three days.

147
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,719
 You never can be sure
 what event we'll be asked to go to.

148
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,599
 Parties, balls, the opera, theatre...

149
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,758
 Oh, yeah...

150
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,759
 It won't happen.

151
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,959
 When Bridget arrives in Spain,
 we'll be invited everywhere.

152
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 They just won't be able to resist.

153
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,038
 What won't they be able to resist?

154
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,039
 What are you wearing?

155
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,439
 I am a toreador.

156
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,119
 Whose is this?

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,559
 Bridget's.

158
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,918
 You are taking all that?

159
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,998
 Yeah. Why?

160
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,678
 Bridget, Bridget, Bridget...

161
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,679
 All you need to travel
 is your passport, your tickets and your money.

162
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,119
 That will be the taxi.

163
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,598
 Let's go.

164
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,599
 Come on, boys,
 give me a hand with my luggage.

165
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
 Gatwick airport, please.

166
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 All you need to travel is your passport,
 your tickets and your money, Nick.

167
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,919
 Yeah, yeah, very funny.

168
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,118
 Wow, look at this!

169
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,479
 -  It's so Spanish.
 -  Yep.

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 Typical Spanish hospitality.

171
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
 And this is a typical happy Spanish waitress.

172
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,199
 Hello.

173
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 We are from England.

174
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 And we would like a drink, please.

175
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,519
 Girls, girls, girls, leave it to me.

176
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 I must translate for you.

177
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,678
 Hang on.

178
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,679
 I'll talk to the lady.

179
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,679
 She doesn't look very happy.

180
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 No, she looks a mess.

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,359
 Perhaps her boyfriend has left her.

182
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,919
 Yes, because she looks a mess.

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,518
 Maybe he didn't like her hair.

184
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,519
 Actually, he did like my hair
 and at least mine is natural.

185
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,799
 She understood.

186
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,798
 She's English.

187
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
 How did you guess?

188
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,399
 So, is this a traditional Spanish bar?

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 This is a traditional English tearoom.

190
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,279
 In Barcelona?

191
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,280
 Aren't you clever?

192
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
 Leave it to me.

193
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,120
 Please can we have a drink?

194
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,238
 No.

195
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,119
 Why not?

196
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
 There are no tables.

197
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
 -  What about this one?
 -  No.

198
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,399
 Or that one?

199
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,839
 -  No.
 -  What about this one here?

200
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,318
 It's reserved.

201
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,319
 Never mind, let's go.

202
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
 But if you reserve the table,
 you can come in.

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,838
 OK.

204
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,839
 Can we please reserve a table?

205
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
 Certainly.

206
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
 Yes, I can just fit you in. That table there.

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 You never can be sure
 what event we'll be asked to go to.

208
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,719
 Wow, look at this! It's so Spanish.

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 She understood.

210
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:56,199
 Yes, I can just fit you in. That table there.

211
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,039
 Right, what would you like to drink?

212
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,318
 -  Cola, please.
 -  Me too.

213
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,039
 And me.

214
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 In Spain, do as the English do.

215
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,519
 I will have a nice cup of tea, please.

216
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,439
 Which tea?

217
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,479
 -  What have you got?
 -  We've got Darjeeling, Kenyan,

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey,
 camomile, peppermint,

219
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,240
 jasmine, Imperial, Oolong,
 Indian, green and yellow tea.

220
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,719
 I'll have a cola please.

221
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,839
 Anything to eat?

222
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,719
 Yes, please. What have you got?

223
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,599
 Egg and chips, sausage and chips, fish and chips,

224
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 cheese and chips, pie and chips
 and chicken and...

225
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,919
 Chips.

226
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 Chicken and croquette potatoes.

227
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,359
 So, we can have anything with chips.

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,758
 Apart from chicken.

229
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,278
 Or I have cake.

230
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,799
 Gatox.

231
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,438
 Gatox?

232
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
 I think she means gateaux.

233
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,959
 Gatox, please.

234
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
 Spanish girls are beautiful.

235
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
 Great! And French girls.

236
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
 Really?

237
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,478
 I don't believe it.

238
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,479
 -  What?
 -  Over there. Over there.

239
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,598
 Yeah?

240
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,438
 -  It's him!
 -  Who?

241
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,319
 Enrique!

242
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,879
 Enrique? Que?

243
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 Not Enrique, que -  Enrique Iglesias!

244
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,238
 No! Are you sure?

245
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:12,239
 -  It can't be!
 -  This is Spain. Well, he's from Spain.

246
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:17,199
 -  Well?
 -  I must go and talk to him.

247
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,119
 -  Hair?
 -  Check.

248
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,958
 -  Lipstick?
 -  Check.

249
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,959
 Top?

250
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,719
 -  Check.
 -  Right.

251
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 Here I go.

252
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,159
 Where's Bridget going?

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
 Enrique Iglesias
 is sitting over there at that table.

254
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 No!

255
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,079
 Enrique!

256
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,239
 -  That is not Enrique Iglesias.
 -  No way.

257
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 Poor Bridget.

258
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 Still, he is quite good- looking.

259
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,438
 Latin men are different to English men.

260
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,439
 They are not sensitive, gentle,
 romantic and sophisticated, like me.

261
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 Gatox.

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,719
 I think the waitress fancies you, Nick.

263
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 Go on, try one of your chat- up lines on her.

264
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:51,559
 She's not my type.

265
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 So what is your type, Nick?

266
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,839
 She's coming back! Go on, go on!

267
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,679
 Which one, which one? I've forgotten them all.

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,680
 Use my one. Stars, stars.

269
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,279
 OK, I remember.

270
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,319
 Your teeth are like stars.

271
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:16,239
 They come out at night.

272
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 It's obvious. She's crazy about me.

273
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,199
 I've got a date with him!
 I've got a date with him!

274
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,198
 Who? Mr Iglesias?

275
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,199
 Don't be silly.
 Of course it's not Enrique Iglesias.

276
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,680
 I'm not that stupid.

277
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 It's Miguel, and tonight we're going clubbing.

278
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,358
 -  Great!
 -  Where are we going?

279
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,359
 No, not you. Miguel and me.

280
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,359
 No, Bridget, we must be your chaperones.

281
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 Yeah, you will not even notice us.

282
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,478
 Well, all right, then.

283
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,479
 All those Spanish girls - clubbing!

284
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,279
 Clubbing! Let's boogie, baby!

285
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,479
 I'll show you how it's done.

286
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,479
 Next time in Extra...

287
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
 England play Argentina in the World Cup.

288
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,799
 Nick gets a phone call.

289
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 And Bridget has a bad hair day.

290
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,159
 And Bridget has a bad hair day.

1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,478
 Hector is dating Annie

4
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,479
 and Bridget wants to go out with Miguel...

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
 and all Nick wants is a job.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,439
 Nearly ready. There we are!

8
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,439
 Perfect!

9
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 Now the living room.

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,478
 Oh, there!

11
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,479
 Just there!

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 Yeah, perfect, baby!

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,480
 Now, refreshments.

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,839
 Cola, yes!

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
 Crisps, yes!

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,879
 And finally...

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Dial- A- Pizza. Yes!

18
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,959
 Only two hours to go!

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,919
 Nick!

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 What is your television doing in my bathroom?

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,119
 Hi, Bridget.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
 -  So I don't miss anything.
 -  Miss anything?

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
 Yeah, if I have to,
 you know, when the match is on.

24
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,158
 Oh, the match.

25
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,519
 So, who's playing today?

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,520
 It's the semi- finals. England...

27
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,998
 Versus...

28
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,999
 Argentina!

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 Hey, Hector, great outfit, but wrong team.

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,360
 And I've got my lucky World Cup pants on.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,359
 Your lucky World Cup pants?

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
 Yep. I don't change them
 when the World Cup is on.

33
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 -  But it lasts for weeks.
 -  Yeah.

34
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,679
 So, Hector, I've got the refreshments ready.

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,159
 Cola, crisps...

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 TV in the bathroom.

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 -  At what time is kickoff?
 -  Midday.

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 We had better sit down, then.

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 Hello, everyone.
 Charley and I are ready for the match.

40
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 Annie, you look nice!

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,238
 -  Your ribbons are different.
 -  That's right.

42
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,239
 One for England and one for Argentina.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
 How sweet!

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,159
 But of course England will win.

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,160
 I don't think so, Nick.

46
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,999
 We beat Jamaica 4- 2.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
 But we beat Italy 3- 0.

48
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,759
 Well, our strikers are the best in the world.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 But your defence is poor.

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,518
 -  No, it's not.
 -  Yes, it is.

51
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,719
 It's not! It's not! It's not!

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,759
 It is! It is! It is!

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,798
 Break!

54
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,799
 And now make friends.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
 You're so childish.

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 Miguel arrives today.
 At least he's a real man.

57
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,879
 But he loves football too.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,599
 A Spanish supporter.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 -  Hello?
 -  We'll beat them, in the final.

60
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,158
 Nick, for you. Your agent.

61
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,879
 Goody!

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 Hi, Cameron. How are you?

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 Good. An audition?

64
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,639
 For me?

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,679
 What for?

66
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,438
 London On Fire?

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,439
 The soap? Yes!

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,159
 When?

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,598
 Today? At midday?

70
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,599
 Where?

71
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,318
 Birmingham?

72
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,319
 But that's 100 miles away.

73
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,559
 No, of course I'm pleased.

74
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,878
 OK, thank you.

75
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,879
 Bye.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 An audition for London On Fire? That's brilliant.

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
 Yeah, you must be pleased, man.

78
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,678
 Yes, I am.

79
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,679
 I am very, very pleased.

80
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,959
 I am so happy.

81
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,599
 I can see that.

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,359
 Why today?

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,399
 Why this afternoon?

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,319
 Why in Birmingham?

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,318
 What about the football?

86
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,319
 It's only a football game.

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,839
 Bridget,

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 there are some people who think
 that football is a matter of life and death.

89
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,198
 It isn't.

90
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,199
 It is much more important than that.

91
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,879
 -  Don't go to the audition, then.
 -  Don't go?

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 Don't go? I must go.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 Drama is my life.

94
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,319
 Look, Nick, we can record it for you.

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
 Yeah, and we won't tell you the score.

96
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,199
 Really? You won't tell me the score?
 You promise?

97
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,519
 -  Promise.
 -  Promise.

98
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,318
 OK, promise.

99
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,358
 OK.

100
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,399
 I will go,

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 and perform for England.

102
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,439
 But of course England will win.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
 Yes!

104
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
 I am so happy.

105
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,558
 I don't believe it.

106
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:28,559
 It's a very, very bad hair day.

107
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,559
 And Miguel is arriving this evening.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
 It's a disaster.

109
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,639
 It's a catastrophe.

110
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,798
 I said it's a catastrophe.

111
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,839
 What is a catastrophe?

112
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,919
 Bridget's hair.

113
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,998
 I've got to do something.

114
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,479
 I know. Carol.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 She'll help me.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 ..we've got all the action coming up.

117
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,918
 Hello? Carol?

118
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,959
 Bridget here.

119
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,358
 Look, this is an emergency.

120
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,759
 I need a hair appointment.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 I need a style
 that a Spanish football fan will adore.

122
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,479
 You can? Goody.

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
 I'll see you at five o'clock.

124
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,718
 Sorted!

125
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,718
 ..this semifinal between the two giants...

126
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,759
 Come on, England!

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 Come on, Argentina!

128
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,039
 ..but a strong team.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 England look like... Are they going to score?
 Yes! It looks like it!

130
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,959
 Now Argentina, coming up on the outside.
 They're looking dangerous.

131
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 They've got through the defence
 and they score.

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 Come on, England. They've got to pull
 themselves together. And who's this?

133
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 Look at him. He's broken through.
 And it's a goal!

134
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 A minute to go in this exciting match
 and England have possession.

135
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,599
 Yes! Yes! Yes! It's gone in!

136
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,679
 What a game!

137
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
 Yeah, it was fantastic.

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,479
 Poor Hector.

139
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 -  Argentina did very well against England.
 -  Yeah.

140
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,839
 But not well enough.

141
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,078
 We must not look too happy.

142
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,798
 We promised Nick not to tell him the score.

143
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,799
 And, Hector,

144
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 you must not look too sad.

145
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
 Come on, try to smile.
 Come on, snuggly puppykins.

146
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 Like this.

147
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 It'll do.

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,638
 Hi, Nick.

149
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,639
 -  Hello.
 -  Hi, Nick.

150
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,239
 -  Good match?
 -  You know, so- so.

151
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,559
 Yeah.

152
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,879
 -  Where's the tape?
 -  Hector's got it.

153
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,279
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In your apartment.

154
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,879
 -  Bye, then.
 -  Bye.

155
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,359
 Yes!

156
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,399
 Hi, Hector.

157
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 Nick, my friend, you are back.

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,319
 Is this is the football match?

159
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Yep.

160
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 -  What?
 -  You won, didn't you?

161
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 -  Won what?
 -  The football.

162
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,519
 Argentina beat England, didn't they?

163
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Nick, I promised you I wouldn't say anything.

164
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,519
 But I know. You're so happy.

165
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 No, I'm not.

166
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 I knew it. I knew it.

167
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,599
 Poor England, my country.

168
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,639
 Nick, you can watch the match on video.

169
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,239
 I can't bear it.

170
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,278
 How, Hector, how could you?

171
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,279
 How could Argentina beat England?

172
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,999
 Nick,

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 just watch the tape.

174
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 I can't wait to see Miguel.

175
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 I'm going to the hairdresser's to get my hair
 done for gorgeous Miguel. Bye.

176
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,160
 Hello.

177
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,519
 OK, repeat after me.

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

179
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

180
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,399
 Bridget, I love your hair.

181
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,439
 Bridget, I love your hair.

182
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 And your smile.

183
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,559
 And your smile.

184
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,559
 No problem, Miguel. See you later.

185
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,398
 Hector and Bridget!

186
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,399
 How could they?

187
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,198
 Argentina did very well against England.

188
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,239
 Yeah.

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 But not well enough.

190
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,919
 This is an emergency.
 I need a hair appointment.

191
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,319
 I need a style
 that a Spanish football fan will adore.

192
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,399
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

193
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,319
 Annie.

194
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,239
 -  Annie?
 -  Yes, Hector?

195
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
 -  Are you all right?
 -  Yes.

196
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 Are you cross about something?

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,640
 Why do you think that?

198
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 Annie, come and sit down.

199
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,918
 Yes!

200
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,919
 Annie, have I done something wrong?

201
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
 Yes!

202
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,238
 Goal!

203
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,239
 Well, if you don't tell me, I won't know.

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You know, Hector. You know.

205
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
 Yes! Yes! Yes! We won!

206
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,559
 We won!

207
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 We're in the final!

208
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 Sorry, have I missed something?

209
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,639
 Bridget?

210
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 Bridget, what's wrong?

211
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,359
 Why have you got a bag on your head?

212
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,199
 -  Come on, let's take it off.
 -  Leave it!

213
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,879
 Is it your hair?

214
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,358
 It can't be that bad.

215
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,799
 It is!

216
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 Come on.

217
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,398
 Do you promise not to laugh?

218
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,399
 We promise.

219
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,759
 Don't we?

220
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 All right, then, here goes.

221
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,839
 It's very...

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,518
 nice.

223
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,518
 I knew it!

224
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,918
 I knew you'd laugh!

225
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,919
 It's a disaster
 and Miguel will be here any moment.

226
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,399
 That's him!

227
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 He mustn't see me like this.

228
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,719
 Miguel?

229
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,079
 Come in.

230
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 I'll just tell Bridget.

231
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,479
 Bridget. Miguel's here.

232
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,759
 I don't want to see him. I can't.

233
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 Trust me, Bridget, he will love your hair.

234
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,799
 Miguel!

235
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

236
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,519
 I love your hair, and your smile.

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 I love your hair.

238
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,279
 So, Spain versus England
 in the World Cup final.

239
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,879
 Poor old England.

240
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 On the contrary, my Spanish friend.

241
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,279
 Prepare to die.

242
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
 Nick, please ask Hector to pass the crisps.

243
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:55,879
 Hector, Annie says can you pass the crisps?

244
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,719
 Please ask Annie
 why hasn't she spoken to me for two days.

245
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,199
 Annie, Hector says
 why haven't you spoken to him for two days?

246
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,238
 Tell him...

247
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,239
 She says...

248
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,599
 It's starting.

249
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 ..final between England
 and their arch- rivals Spain.

250
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,798
 Come on, England. Come on.

251
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,799
 Come on, Spain.

252
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,399
 He passes to Scholes, and yes...

253
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 -  Go on!
 -  And here's Spain...and it's a goal!

254
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,839
 -  Yes!
 -  Goal!

255
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,239
 England have the ball.
 They are heading for goal.

256
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 Yes!

257
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Annie, can I ask you something?

258
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,359
 Yes, Hector?

259
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,479
 Have you ever thought about getting married?

260
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,239
 Who to?

261
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,518
 To someone...

262
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,438
 Someone like...me.

263
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,439
 ..and he shoots and he scores!

264
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,399
 I don't believe it!

265
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,478
 What a match!

266
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,718
 Spain played really well.

267
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,719
 Yeah, but not well enough.

268
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,319
 Poor Miguel. Speak to me in English again.

269
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

270
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
 I love your hair and your smile.

271
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,719
 -  Is that all he knows?
 -  Yep, and I taught him.

272
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 -  When?
 -  On the phone.

273
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:10,479
 You were on the phone to Miguel!

274
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,558
 -  Teaching him English.
 -  Silly me!

275
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,559
 I thought you were talking to Bridget.

276
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Annie, there is only one person for me.

277
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,199
 Me?

278
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,959
 Well? Will you?

279
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,079
 Will she what?

280
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 Marry me?

281
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,959
 Yes, Hector!

282
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,478
 Next time in Extra...

283
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:58,238
 Hector and Annie plan their wedding.

284
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,678
 Nick is in for a surprise.

285
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,679
 And guess who's coming from Argentina.

286
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:03,838
 And guess who's coming from Argentina.

1
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,039
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,879
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 Hector andAnnie want to get married.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Bridget also wants to get married,
 but to whom?

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,039
 And Nickjust wants to get away.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,798
 Hector, it's perfect!

8
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
 Yeah, perfect.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,039
 Hector, you have mail.

10
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,879
 And they're all from your mother.

11
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,959
 -  Shall I?
 -  Yes, please, do.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
 What do they say?

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,998
 Well, she says...

14
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,999
 'How many bridesmaids is Annie having?

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,839
 'Ten or twelve?'

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,158
 Ten or twelve?

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,159
 You will like this one, Annie.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
 'Have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
 'I'm coming to London soon, to help you.'

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,958
 Hector!

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,959
 Your mother is very kind,
 but we want a small wedding.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,199
 She must not interfere.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
 Annie.

24
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,479
 Hector, we want our pet wedding, don't we?

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, she must not interfere any more.

26
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 It's OK. I won't let her. Come here.

27
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,919
 You look happy!

28
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,198
 Man trouble?

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,199
 How is...Miguel?

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
 Miguel is finished.

31
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
 It's all football, football, football with Miguel.

32
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,319
 What do you expect from Spanish men?

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 So, I said, 'Bye- bye, Miguel.'

34
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,358
 And Annie and Hector are so happy.

35
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,359
 It's weddings, weddings, weddings.

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 I'll never find a decent man.

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,478
 I'll just be single forever!

38
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,479
 Rubbish!
 What you need is a new man in your life.

39
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 But where can I get one?

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
 Hi. Bridget here.
 Can I have a new man, please?

41
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,799
 What about that gorgeous...Nick?

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,079
 Nick?

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 He's great as Pierce Steele in London On Fire.

44
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,118
 What a hunk!

45
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,119
 But he's...

46
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479
 Come on, Bridget,
 you say you want a new man.

47
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,479
 Well, let me introduce you to the new Nick.

48
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,159
 I want you to interview him
 for Stars at 9 on 9.

49
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,558
 Interview Nick?

50
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,439
 But all he talks about is girls.

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
 -  And motorbikes.
 -  Forget what he says.

52
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,679
 Ask him to take his jacket off!

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 Here, look at this.

54
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,879
 London On Fire.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 Enjoy it!

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 Oh, Pierce,
 how can I ever thankyou?

57
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,199
 It was nothing.

58
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
 It's all in a day's work for...

59
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,239
 Pierce Steele.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Nick.

61
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
 Come and sit down.

62
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,879
 OK.

63
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,718
 What are you reading?

64
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,359
 A magazine about weddings.

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 I love weddings. Don't you?

66
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
 The problem is I'm always the bridesmaid,
 never the bride.

67
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,958
 Isn't it lovely?

68
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,959
 Yeah! The Ferrari Testarossa.

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
 -  What a great car!
 -  I meant her dress!

70
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,038
 Do you like it, Nick?

71
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,039
 Well, it wouldn't suit me.

72
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,559
 Nick, you're so funny.

73
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,559
 I love funny men.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,839
 I need a drink. Would you like one?

75
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
 And good- looking ones.

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 I'd love to marry a funny, good- looking man.

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
 By the way, Nick, I saw London On Fire.

78
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,918
 You're very good in it.

79
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,478
 Really? Did you think so?

80
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,759
 In fact, I wondered if...

81
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,358
 -  Yeah?
 -  If you want to...

82
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,398
 -  Yeah?
 -  Will you...

83
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,399
 -  Yeah?
 -  Will you do an interview for Channel 9?

84
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 Yeah.

85
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,359
 She must not interfere.

86
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,359
 Interview Nick?

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
 But all he talks about is girls.
 And motorbikes.

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
 Will you do an interview for Channel 9?

89
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,239
 Yeah.

90
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,279

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 Courtesy of Mrs Romero. Wedding dresses.

92
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,039
 Courtesy of Mrs Romero. Honeymoons.

93
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,399
 Hector's mother is driving me mad!

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
 Maybe I should just cancel the wedding.

95
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,919
 Really? Well, I wouldn't.

96
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,439
 I suppose marriage will mean sacrifices.

97
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,999
 No more shaving your legs on the toilet,
 no more soaps on TV.

98
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,399
 -  Oh, no!
 -  No more midnight chocolate feasts.

99
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,039
 But then...you will be Mrs Romero.

100
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,879
 Do you think Bridget is ill?

101
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,118
 No. Why?

102
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,119
 She's being very nice to me. Very nice.

103
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,879
 Well, maybe she is ill.

104
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 She was talking about weddings,
 you and Annie.

105
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 You don't think she wants to get married too,
 do you?

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,078
 Who to?

107
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,079
 Well, you said she was being very nice to you.

108
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
 No! You don't think?

109
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
 Annie.

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,640
 I have something to tell you.

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 -  What?
 -  Nick.

112
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,359
 Nick what?

113
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
 I fancy Nick.

114
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 She did mean me!

115
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,319
 Hector, help!

116
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,879
 Once you're married, they've got you!

117
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 -  You fancy Nick?
 -  Yes, I do. I do!

118
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,039
 -  But you don't like Nick.
 -  I do like Nick.

119
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,639
 -  No, you don't, you think he's an idiot.
 -  Yes, but he's so macho.

120
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 -  You think he's vain.
 -  But he's so good- looking.

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,558
 You don't like his clothes.

122
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,559
 But now he wears a fireman's uniform.

123
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
 So that's it! The uniform.

124
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,039
 He's so sexy in London On Fire.

125
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
 So what are you going to do?

126
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
 Tomorrow I will interview him for Channel 9...

127
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,398
 And then?

128
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,918
 You'll just have to wait and see.

129
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,919
 There is one good thing about getting married.

130
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
 Yeah, love.

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,798
 No! No!

132
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,799
 The stag night.

133
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,599
 -  The what?
 -  The stag night.

134
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 It's when the bridegroom, that's you,
 is taken out by his best man, that's me,

135
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
 to say goodbye.

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 -  Goodbye?
 -  Yep, to your fantastic life as a single man.

137
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,039
 Goodbye to drinking beer
 and watching football in bed.

138
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 Goodbye to eating curry for breakfast.

139
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 And worst of all...

140
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 goodbye to Kylie Minogue!

141
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 Don't worry, Hector, we will face this together.

142
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,639
 Thank you, Nick. You are a real friend.

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 Anyway...

144
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,719
 this stag night...

145
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,719
 what are we going to do?

146
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,198
 -  Go to the cinema?
 -  Wha...

147
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,199
 In England, we do crazy things!

148
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 We party, we go to Brighton, we dress up...

149
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,399
 -  As what?
 -  Women!

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 So I am here with Nick Jessop,

151
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,359
 or Pierce Steele,
 straight from the set of London On Fire.

152
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,439
 -  Nick.
 -  Good evening.

153
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 Do you think London On Fire accurately reflects

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 the pressures
 on London's emergency services?

155
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,639
 Dunno! But the women are good- looking.

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,839
 Do you get very hot?

157
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,678
 -  When?
 -  In the flames, when you're filming.

158
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,679
 No, not really.

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,678
 Do you take your jacket off sometimes?

160
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,199
 Yeah, sometimes.

161
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 -  When it gets very...hot?
 -  Yeah.

162
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
 -  Do you want to take your jacket off now?
 -  No, not really.

163
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,798
 -  And what about the women?
 -  The women?

164
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,118
 The women you rescue.

165
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,119
 You carry them out of the house that is on fire.

166
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 -  Yeah.
 -  They must love it.

167
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,119
 Well, they are acting.

168
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
 -  And do they ask you to...
 -  Do they ask me to what?

169
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,038
 -  Take your jacket off.
 -  No.

170
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,039
 Will you take it off now?

171
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,839
 OK.

172
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:09,398
 -  Could you carry me?
 -  When?

173
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,399
 Now! Carry me like you do on London On Fire!

174
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,278
 OK.

175
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,318
 You're so strong!

176
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,319
 This is Bridget Evans with Nick Jessop
 for Channel 9.

177
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,159
 -  Shall I put you down now?
 -  Do you have to?

178
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,079
 Hi, Hector.

179
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,959
 Hi, Annie.

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,998
 -  Hector...
 -  Annie...

181
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,999
 -  No, you go first.
 -  No, you first.

182
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
 OK. Annie, this wedding...

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 I was going to say, 'This wedding...'

184
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,159
 -  OK, you say it, then.
 -  No, you.

185
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,158
 OK, let's write it down.

186
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,159
 Good idea.

187
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,439
 Ready?

188
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
 One, two, three, show!

189
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
 Yes, Hector, let's wait.

190
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,119
 -  This wedding is a nightmare.
 -  Yeah.

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 -  Let's celebrate not getting married.
 -  Yeah.

192
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,839
 OK, I'm going shopping now,
 but meet me at Leo's Cafe at 5pm.

193
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,879
 I'll be there!

194
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,479
 You must tell your mother. Thank goodness
 she's thousands of miles away in Argentina.

195
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 Make sure you tell her before she leaves.

196
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,479
 Oh, no!

197
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 Meet me at Leo's cafe at 5pm.

198
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,839
 Annie...or Mum?

199
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,359
 Mum...or Annie?

200
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,479
 Nick, you're so funny!

201
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 The stag night!

202
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 The what?

203
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,439
 We dress up!

204
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
 -  As what?
 -  Women.

205
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,359
 You're so strong!

206
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,038
 Hi, Nick. Did you have a good day?

207
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,399
 Great! I saved London again.

208
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:04,199
 And I was interviewed by Bridget.

209
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,239
 Man, I thought
 she was going to ask me to marry her!

210
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 Great.

211
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 OK, what's up?

212
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 My mother is coming to London.

213
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,799
 -  Does Annie know?
 -  No.

214
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,958
 Whoops!

215
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,958
 But we have cancelled the wedding.

216
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,239
 -  Does your mother know?
 -  No.

217
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,038
 Whoops!

218
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,878
 It gets worse.

219
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,879
 I was supposed to meet both of them
 this afternoon in different places.

220
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,398
 Triple whoops!

221
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,399
 Hector, don't worry.

222
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,679
 Women always forget.

223
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,919
 Hi, Annie.

224
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 -  Hector, where are you?
 -  Annie, listen!

225
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 I'm glad we're not getting married!

226
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,159
 So they didn't forget?

227
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 Annie, please!

228
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,959
 -  Listen to me!
 -  What or who is more important than me?

229
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,479
 -  First marriage row.
 -  We are not getting married.

230
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,598
 Pardon me!

231
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,679
 Annie, today was difficult.

232
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,679
 Impossible.

233
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,478
 I don't want to know!

234
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,479
 -  Annie, it's my mother.
 -  What about your mother?

235
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,239
 Here is Mother!

236
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,759
 Hector, darling!

237
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
 Speak to me in English. I'm taking lessons.

238
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,599
 Where's Annie? Where's my little bride?

239
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,279
 What a beauty!
 Hector, you've kept her beauty a secret.

240
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
 No, Mama, this is Bridget.

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 This is Annie.

242
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,119
 Donatella...can help you.

243
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,719
 Annie is the prettiest, sweetiest,
 kindest girl in the world.

244
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,639
 Really?

245
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,479
 Didn't you tell her the wedding is off?

246
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
 -  I didn't get the chance.
 -  Well, now's the time.

247
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,318
 -  Mum.
 -  Yes?

248
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,319
 Annie and I have decided to...

249
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
 Wait a few years before we get married.

250
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,559
 No wedding? Oh, no!

251
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:53,879
 Thank you, Bridget.

252
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,039
 Do you have a boyfriend?

253
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 I hope so, Mrs Romero.

254
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,319
 Is he handsome?

255
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 Yes, he's very handsome...

256
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,959
 and muscular!

257
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 I love macho men.

258
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,199
 What's his name?

259
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 Nick. Nick Jessop.

260
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 Nick? Hector's best man?

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Yes, that's him.

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Time to party!

263
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,479
 Mama, meet...

264
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,719
 Nick.

265
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 So, have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?

266
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,318
 Next time in Extra...

267
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,238
 Bridget tries to change Nick.

268
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,719
 Hector's mother comes to dinner.

269
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 But why does Annie behave badly?

270
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,118
 But whydoesAnnie behave badly?

1
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,439
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector, from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,760
 Annie and Hector have decided
 not to get married.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 Bridget and Nick are dating,
 but Nick is getting bored,

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,559
 so will it last?

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,560
 Find out in Extra.

7
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,998
 Oh, Bridget...

8
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,399
 this is wonderful.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,038
 I'm so glad you like it, Nick.

10
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,039
 I just can't get enough.
 I want more, more, more!

11
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,999
 Nick, honey,
 there's plenty more where that came from.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 -  Nick?
 -  Yes, Bridget darling?

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,759
 -  How long have we been together now?
 -  Erm...

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
 We've been together two days, Nick.

15
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,919
 Wow! That long? Hmm!

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 Yes, it is a long time, Nick.

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 But if...we are to...

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 continue our relationship,

19
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,639
 you must...

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,758
 Will you...?

21
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,759
 Will you treat me like a lady?

22
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,039
 Bridget darling, just call me Gentleman Nick.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
 Nick! Nick!

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 You must... There must be more...

25
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,919
 Snogging!

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 There must be more respect.

27
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,159
 Oh, Nick.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,918
 Let's see what sort of gentleman you are.

29
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,919
 Here's a little test. Follow me.

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 -  Well?
 -  Well, what?

31
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,799
 I want to go out.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 -  Oh.
 -  So...

33
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,878
 -  What do you do?
 -  Oh!

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,679
 -  Kiss you goodbye!
 -  No.

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,199
 You open the door for me.

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,238
 Huh? Ah!

37
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,239
 Because I am the strongest!

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 Rahr! Rahr! Tarzan!

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Oh, come on, Ziggy, we'll be late.

40
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,199
 Is just you and Ziggy doing this protest?

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Yes, but when other people see how important
 it is, they'll join us. We must stop...

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,279
 Oh, excuse me, Annie.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 -  Problems?
 -  What? Oh, no, no, no.

44
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,079
 -  No problems at all.
 -  Oh, look! There's Ziggy. Must dash.

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
 -  Have fun!
 -  This is not fun. This is serious.

46
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,839
 This is serious too.

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,158
 Now, clothes.

48
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:18,198
 What?

49
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,199
 I want you more...like David Beckham.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
 Ah, like this!

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,758
 Now, where is it?

52
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,879
 Aha! Here it is.

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 Now, come here.

54
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,759
 -  Really, Bridget, I don't think...
 -  Oh, don't be silly, Nick.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
 There! That's better.

56
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,279
 Now, we must go deeper.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,678
 There is a bigger problem.

58
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,679
 You have a lot of anger in there.

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 Well, yes, I am wearing this stupid hair band.

60
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,599
 So, we must work on your inner calm.

61
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,439
 I want to see your chest.

62
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,238
 OK!

63
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,239
 Lie down.

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,118
 Close your eyes...

65
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,038
 and relax.

66
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,879
 Ahhh!

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 Now, this may tickle a bit.

68
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
 -  Ready?
 -  Yeah.

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 Here goes!

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 Just feel that anger go!

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
 Acupuncture never fails.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
 -  Oh, hi, Mrs Romero.
 -  Hello, Bridget. Where is Hector?

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,359
 Hello, Mrs Romero.

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
 Do you remember Nick, Mrs Romero?

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Time to party!

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
 I can't forget him.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,839
 Oh! Hola, Mama!

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,878
 Sorry I'm late.

79
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,879
 -  Coffee?
 -  Oh, yes, please.

80
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,839
 Excuse us, Mrs Romero.

81
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,039
 Come on, Nick, I'm taking you shopping.

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 -  Uh- uh.
 -  Oh? So you want some more acupuncture?

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,519
 OK, OK, I'm coming, I'm coming.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 And don't forget your money.

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,798
 Rahr! Rahr!

86
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,799
 Oh, you are learning quickly.

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 I want you more like David Beckham.

88
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,960
 Ah, like this?

89
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,439
 Wow! That long? Hmm!

90
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,319
 Oh! You are learning quickly!

91
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 Oh, oh, oh, oh!
 Mother, when in London, we speak English.

92
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,039
 Yes, we must. English is the language
 of high class, so I must teach it...

93
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,799
 Learn.

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 -  You must learn it, not teach it.
 -  Oh, yes.

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 So your father has found you a wife.

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 He told me. He must stop shopping on eBay.

97
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,039
 Look, Mum, I don't want a wife.

98
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,638
 I've got Annie.

99
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,639
 This girl is from a good family.

100
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
 -  So is Annie.
 -  This girl is rich.

101
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,439
 I don't care about money.

102
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,479
 But she's almost royalty.

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 Mum, Annie is my princess.

104
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,598
 But she's so...

105
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,599
 She's so clever, so kind, so happy!

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 -  Annie?
 -  Very happy!

107
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,439
 What happened?

108
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 Ziggy and I were in a field lying down.

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,158
 Sunbathing?

110
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,159
 -  Protesting.
 -  And...?

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 It began to rain!

112
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 Oh, poor Annie.

113
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,078
 Don't touch her!

114
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,079
 Now, listen, Mum, I've told you I love Annie.

115
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,598
 Be careful, your pullover.

116
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,358
 Hector, your mother's right.

117
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,359
 Don't touch me!

118
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,279
 Why did you do that?

119
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 Because I love you, darling.

120
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,799
 If you knew Annie, you would love her.

121
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
 Well, I'm going home tomorrow.

122
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,719
 Look, Mum, come to dinner tonight
 and you will meet the real Annie.

123
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 And if you don't like her, then...

124
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:40,319
 then I might marry the princess Dad has found.

125
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,239
 Annie?

126
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,879
 -  Annie.
 -  Yes, Hector?

127
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,679
 -  Can we talk?
 -  If that's OK with your mother.

128
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,239
 Oh, Annie, she's gone to her hotel now.

129
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,759
 Look, she's going home tomorrow

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 and I thought
 we would invite her to dinner tonight.

131
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,798
 Well, I'm going out.

132
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,799
 Annie, please don't be silly.
 Stay and be nice to her.

133
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,599
 She is OK, really.

134
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 Well, OK then.

135
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,839
 But you must do one thing for me.

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
 Sure. What?

137
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 -  Scrub my back.
 -  Oh, but I am still dressed.

138
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 So am I. Well, I can't put these
 in the washing machine. They're filthy.

139
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,358
 Apricot?

140
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,359
 No. Annie, will you behave?

141
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 -  When?
 -  When my mother comes to dinner.

142
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,759
 Probably.

143
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 Strawberry.

144
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
 Annie, I have an idea.

145
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 Nick is pretending to be someone different.

146
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 Nick isn't pretending. This is the new Nick.
 Isn't it, Nick?

147
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,439
 You can pretend as well.

148
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 What, Princess Caroline of Monaco?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Look, Nick is pretending
 to be what Bridget wants.

151
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:25,359
 Yeah, a slave.

152
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
 How can I help?
 As you can see, I'm a talented stylist.

153
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 Could I have some more cola, please, sweetie?

154
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,479
 My mother is coming to dinner tonight.

155
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,518
 Oh! So what's on the menu?

156
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,959
 I am!

157
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
 What sort of food does your mother like?

158
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,879
 Babies on toast?

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 I don't know. A traditional English dish.

160
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,199
 I am not going to pretend to eat meat.

161
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,520
 How about roast Annie?

162
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 I know.
 What about sweet and sour prawn balls?

163
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,759
 -  Sweet for me...
 -  And sour for Hector's mum!

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,319
 Nick, behave.

165
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
 Very funny.

166
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,999
 I will cook dinner.

167
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And Nick will look after your mother
 because he's such a gentleman now.

168
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,920
 Don't you worry about Mrs R.
 She'll have a great time.

169
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 Leave it to me.

170
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,759
 So, Annie, will you pretend?

171
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,998
 OK, Hector.

172
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,999
 For you, tonight,
 I will pretend to be the perfect girlfriend.

173
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,918
 Annie,

174
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,919
 you and I are going shopping.

175
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 Too obvious.

176
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 Too Margaret Thatcher.

177
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,039
 Hector will love it, but, no.

178
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,599
 Perfect!

179
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,039
 Don't touch her!

180
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 Your mother's right. Don't touch me!

181
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,479
 -  No!
 -  You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

182
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 What? Princess Caroline of Monaco?

183
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 Perfect!

184
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,440
 Yeah, a slave.

185
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,758
 Wow! Annie!

186
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,799
 You look great.

187
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 I look 45 years old.

188
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:14,719
 But my mother will like it.

189
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,359
 Snap!

190
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,639
 Versace?

191
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
 Marks and Spencer's.

192
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
 Have you enjoyed your visit to London,
 Mrs Romero?

193
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,438
 I love London.

194
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,439
 We often visit our friends, Liz and Phil.

195
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,279
 And where do they live?

196
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,438
 Buckingham Palace.

197
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,439
 There you are, Mrs Romero.

198
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 Oh, you are so handsome, Nick.

199
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 Annie has had an interesting day today, haven't
 you, Annie?

200
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
 Go on, Annie,
 tell Mother about your interesting day.

201
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
 OK. Well, our GM protest went very well today.

202
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,919
 What's GM?

203
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,959
 I don't know.

204
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,079
 Great Men?

205
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,080
 A Great Men protest?

206
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 -  Really?
 -  It means genetically modified.

207
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,839
 Listen, Mum.

208
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:11,199
 So, so the farmer came over
 to see what we were doing...

209
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,838
 Oh, GM, GM! Gorgeous Men!

210
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
 Ooh!

211
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,840
 -  Another drink, Mrs R?
 -  Oh, yes, Nick, please.

212
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 You have lovely eyes.

213
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,359
 Anyway, he told us to go away,
 and when we wouldn't...

214
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,358
 There you are, madam.

215
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,359
 -  Where did you learn your beautiful manners?
 -  Oh, I was born with them.

216
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,639
 Sit down.

217
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,439
 And then the police arrested us,

218
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 but I escaped prison so I could be here tonight.

219
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
 It is a joke!

220
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,159
 Come on, Mum, talk to Annie.

221
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,039
 So, Annie, Hector tells me you like animals.

222
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,999
 Oh, I love them, but I don't eat them.

223
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,719
 I'm a vegetarian.

224
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,759
 How odd.

225
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
 If we cannot eat animals,

226
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,440
 why are they made of meat, then?

227
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,559
 You are so funny, Nick.

228
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,278
 But I do love horses.

229
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,279
 Oh, yes, they're wonderful.

230
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
 And I love riding.

231
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,959
 I love your English hunt.

232
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 Yes, the dogs, the handsome men in red coats.

233
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 -  The dead fox.
 -  Yes, the dead fox.

234
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,679
 No! It's cruel.

235
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,879
 The poor fox.

236
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
 What do you know?
 You are not from a good family.

237
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:00,399
 There's nothing wrong with my family.

238
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,559
 You are not family of beauty.

239
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,759
 Well, anyway,
 I don't believe that Hector is your son.

240
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,838
 He's too good- looking!

241
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,039
 Right, that's it.

242
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,079
 I'm going.

243
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 Mum, Annie didn't mean...
 Annie, Mum didn't mean...

244
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 Yes, we did!

245
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 And another thing.
 You won't need hounds on a hunt.

246
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 When the fox sees you coming, he'll run!

247
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 Hector, I shall see you in Argentina
 for your wedding...

248
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,079
 to our perfect princess.

249
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,959
 Well, that went rather well, didn't it!

250
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:00,639
 Oh, who is this?

251
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 He's darling!

252
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 -  Oh, that's Charley. Charley belongs to A...
 -  Me!

253
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,879
 -  He's my baby.
 -  Isn't he gorgeous?

254
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 Look, darling, here's Mummy.

255
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,358
 Women!

256
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,359
 So, Hector,
 who's this Latin American princess?

257
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 Well, my father wants me to marry her,

258
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 but I will not, of course.

259
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
 Well, if you don't want her, I'll have her.

260
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,359
 More wine, Nick!

261
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,799
 Next time in Extra:

262
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,079
 Nick gets ajob as a bouncer.

263
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 If your name's not on the guest list,
 then you cannot come in!

264
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 Annie gets a tattoo,

265
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,799
 and Hector wants to be a tough guy.

266
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,318
 Extra, don't miss it.

267
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,318
 Extra, don'tmissit.

1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,158
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,

2
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,199
 who share a flat in London.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 And the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector, from Argentina.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,798
 Annie and Hector are in love.

5
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:30,799
 Bridget and Nick are still dating, just.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 But Nick is desperate for ajob. Anyjob.

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,518
 Hector, stop being such a baby.

9
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,639
 But it hurts!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 I haven't touched you yet.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
 Now stay still. You will
 just feel a little needle prick.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
 Go on then. Hurt me, do it!

13
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,799
 Hector!

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 Hector! I've done it.

15
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,959
 I've removed the splinter.

16
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,039
 Yes, I knew that. I was joking.

17
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,639
 What is it? Are you scared of needles?

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,359
 Who, me?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,519
 Don't be silly.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,520
 But it was a very painful splinter.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 OK, so if you're not scared of needles,
 would you have a tattoo?

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 A tattoo?

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,558
 Yes. Yes, I would.

24
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,559
 Go on, then, tough guy.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
 OK, I'll have one if you have one.

26
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,559
 OK.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
 OK, it's a deal.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,878
 By the way, Hector...

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 I had this done this morning.

30
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,039
 But then, a deal is a deal, isn't it?

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 I want a word with you.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
 Tough guy, eh?

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 Yeah? What do you want?

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,439
 I don't...

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
 I don't...

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,319
 I keep forgetting this bit!

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 I don't like your face.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 OK, so is this for television or theatre?

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 Nope. This is real. This is me.

40
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,118
 And you are...

41
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,119
 Can't you guess?

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
 Guys, you are looking at Muscles.

43
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,839
 -  Where?
 -  No, no, no. It's my new name.

44
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,879
 I am the new man on the door at Ice.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 What, you're a bouncer?

46
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,158
 What is a bouncer?

47
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,159
 It's someone
 who throws people out of nightclubs.

48
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,279
 I am an entry executive.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 -  So you throw people out of the club?
 -  Yeah.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
 Yeah. Nick, my granny could beat you up.

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 But if your granny came to Ice
 and caused trouble,

52
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,719
 I would have to ask her to leave.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
 Besides, I'd have Knuckles,
 Cruncher and Muncher to back me up.

54
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,559
 Who?

55
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,719
 -  The other bouncers.
 -  Yeah, right.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,558
 -  Hi, sweetie.
 -  Has someone died?

57
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,359
 No, not yet.

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,478
 Why are you dressed in black then?

59
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,318
 Because, baby,

60
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,319
 you are looking at the new man
 on the door at Ice.

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,678
 You are on the door at Ice?

62
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,679
 But that's... But that's wonderful news!

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,639
 What shall I wear?

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
 I'll call the girls
 to find out what they're wearing.

65
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,479
 The thing is, Bridget,

66
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 if your name's not on the guest list,
 then you can't come in.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
 Nick, if my name's not on the guest list,

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 then you can't come home.

69
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,679
 Hello?

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,279
 Hi!

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,319
 Yep, that's right.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
 I start on Friday? OK, baby!

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 No probs. Leave it with me.

74
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:48,239
 Ciao!

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 My mum. She wants me
 to do some...gardening for her.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 I am the new man on the door at Ice!

77
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,799
 I don't like your face.

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,638
 If your name's not on the guest list,

79
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,639
 then you can't come in.

80
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,518
 Hector, I just won...

81
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,238
 What are you doing?

82
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,839
 Just looking for a number.

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,918
 I see.

84
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,919
 Well, I just wondered if you wanted
 to share my chocolate with me

85
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,999
 -  before Bridget sees it.
 -  Yeah! Great! Thanks.

86
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,838
 Annie?

87
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,839
 Did I tell you about the time
 three people tried to fight me?

88
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,439
 -  All at once?
 -  Yep.

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 Really? Well, go on.

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 Well, three of them, they came at me.

91
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
 Oh, you poor thing!
 And what did they want?

92
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,799
 My sweets.

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 -  And how old were you?
 -  Six.

94
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,959
 And they were...?

95
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
 Five, three and two.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 Hector! Two years old! They were babies!

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
 Yeah, but the Sanchez sisters
 were really tough!

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
 Hector, you are sweet.

99
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,519
 Do you think I should be more macho?

100
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,399
 Hector, you don't have to be
 a tough guy for me.

101
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,318
 I love you just the way you are.

102
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,919
 Annie.

103
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
 Come on, let's eat this chocolate
 before Bridget finds it.

104
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,799
 Please, let me.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You're so strong!

106
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,919
 -  What is it?
 -  You are standing on my foot.

107
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,039
 Wimp.

108
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
 -  Hi, Nick.
 -  Hi.

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 Hey, listen to this.

110
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,719
 Bouncer of the month is Alex Smith,

111
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,159
 who last year stopped 955 people

112
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,438
 from going into his club.

113
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,439
 -  What is the name of the club?
 -  It doesn't say.

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 It shut down last week.
 Not enough people were going there.

115
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,118
 Nick?

116
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,119
 What is a wimp?

117
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,079
 Well, it's not...

118
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,839
 Annie just called me a wimp.

119
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,559
 I want to be a tough guy, like you.

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
 Can you teach me, please?

121
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,879
 Of course, I was born like this,

122
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,919
 but I can try to help you, Hector,
 I can try.

123
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,039
 Great!

124
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 Why don't you show me
 how to be a bouncer.

125
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,040
 Att...i...tude.

126
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,598
 Att...i...tude?

127
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,599
 Yeah. Like this.

128
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,479
 Are you looking at me?

129
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 Are you looking at me?

130
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,719
 Are you looking at me?

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Are you looking at me?

132
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,040
 Hey, great!

133
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,119
 So who am I looking at
 when I say that?

134
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,799
 Anyone who is looking for trouble.

135
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,559
 And how do I know
 they are looking for trouble?

136
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 You just know.

137
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,479
 Look.

138
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,479
 What is this?

139
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,718
 Bridget's old toys.

140
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,719
 What are they
 doing under your bed, then?

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,719
 I was looking after them for her.

142
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,758
 Yeah, anyway, look.

143
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,759
 Here, this is the club.

144
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
 You cannot come in!

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,918
 Let me in!

146
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,919
 Are you looking at me
 or chewing a brick, eh?

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 Cos either way, you'll lose your teeth.

148
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 You know, brick, teeth, chew.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,998
 Very good!

150
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,999
 You are a very scary guy.

151
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,119
 Look! It's handsome Nick!

152
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 Look at his muscles.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 Hello! You are looking lovely tonight.

154
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,959
 Leave my boyfriend alone!

155
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,079
 It's OK, Bridget. I'm just doing my job.

156
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,799
 If your name's not on the guest list,

157
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,079
 then you cannot come in.

158
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,879
 If your name's not on the guest list,

159
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 then you cannot come in.

160
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,358
 Please could I have your name, sir?

161
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,359
 What do you want that for?

162
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
 Because if your name's not on the g...

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 guest list, you cannot come in.

164
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,199
 And what are you going to do about it,
 pip...squeak?

165
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,318
 I...

166
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,358
 I'm...

167
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 I...

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 So be a good boy!

169
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,839
 Didn't you hear what the man said?

170
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 He said,
 'Go. Disappear. Vanish. Evaporate. Now!'

171
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 OK, I'm going!

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,878
 Sorry you had to see that, Bridget.

173
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,879
 Course, I had the situation
 completely under control.

174
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,918
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,839
 So, Bridget, why are you here?

176
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,199
 What?

177
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 -  I've brought you some sandwiches.
 -  Bridget, how nice of you.

178
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,399
 -  Where are they?
 -  Where are what?

179
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,439
 The sandwiches.

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
 I must have left them behind. Never mind!

181
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,079
 So, who's here tonight?

182
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 I'm afraid I can't tell you.
 It's confidential.

183
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,038
 OK.

184
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,758
 Well, there's the usual crowd.

185
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,759
 Heidi, Kate, Naomi.

186
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,519
 Sorry, Bridget. I have work to do.

187
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 Good evening, ladies!

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
 Could I have your names, please?

189
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,359
 Thank you. Just one more thing. Bridget!

190
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,840
 Arms up, please, ladies.

191
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Let me see. Very nice.

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 Thank you.

193
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,318
 Thank you very much, ladies.

194
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,319
 Have a great evening.

195
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 All part of the job.

196
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
 OK, Nick. So when is it my turn?

197
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,239
 I want to go in!

198
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 Bridget, Bridget, Bridget. I promise.

199
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,519
 As soon as I can arrange it, I will.

200
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 Look, there's a big Latino night next week.

201
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,439
 -  J- Lo will be coming.
 -  J- Lo?

202
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,559
 Leave it to me.

203
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
 Thank you, Nick!

204
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
 Stand back. I need to take control.

205
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,359
 Good!

206
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 Everything is under control.

207
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Wimp!

208
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,879
 Good evening, ladies!

209
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 I have the situation
 completely under control.

210
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
 -  J- Lo will be coming.
 -  J- Lo?

212
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,039
 Annie?

213
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
 About the tattoo.

214
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,559
 Look.

215
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 You did it!

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
 And Hector, what a wonderful tattoo!

217
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,159
 I don't know what to say!

218
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,198
 It was nothing.

219
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,519
 And I mean it.

220
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 Hector and Annie forever.

221
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 And look!
 Charley likes the tattoo as well.

222
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Charley!

223
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
 Hector!

224
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
 Please. I've just eaten!

225
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,759
 Bridget, look.

226
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 Hector has had a tattoo done just for me!

227
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,519
 Isn't it romantic?

228
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,799
 Hec- ni- ver.

229
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 Hec- ni- ver? It doesn't sound
 very romantic. What does it mean?

230
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,078
 What's happened?

231
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,079
 It's coming off!

232
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 Charley has licked it off.

233
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,679
 It's a fake!

234
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 Hector, you wimp!

235
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,278
 -  Hector.
 -  Hi, Nick.

236
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,279
 -  What's the joke?
 -  I am.

237
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,158
 Listen.

238
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,159
 J- Lo is coming to Ice tonight,

239
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,440
 so we need extra bouncers.

240
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,399
 So you will be working with me
 on the door!

241
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,078
 But I...

242
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,079
 And tell Bridget and Annie
 they are on the guest list.

243
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,959
 -  OK, tough guy?
 -  OK.

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 Yeah.

245
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 Good evening, ladies!

246
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 You are looking lovely tonight.

247
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Hector, you look so handsome.

248
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,279
 I'm sorry I laughed at your tattoo.

249
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 Annie, Annie, Annie, I am on duty.

250
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,479
 Is J- Lo here yet?

251
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,358
 She's here.

252
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,359
 Goodie! I love mixing with the stars.

253
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,999
 -  Hi.
 -  Hello.

254
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,438
 She's cute.

255
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,439
 Hi, gorgeous.

256
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,959
 -  What did he say?
 -  Nothing.

257
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
 Was he...?

258
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,079
 -  What are you looking at?
 -  I am looking at you looking at her.

259
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,318
 I can look at her.

260
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,319
 Not when I am looking at her
 looking at you.

261
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 I think you mean, 'Not when
 I'm looking at you looking at her.'

262
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,398
 That is what I said!

263
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,399
 You know what? I tell you
 I'm gonna buy her a drink, OK?

264
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,079
 What did he say?

265
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 I think he said
 he's gonna buy her a drink.

266
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 Hector, no!

267
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
 Right, that is it! I am going in!

268
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,358
 No, Hector, don't! Leave it!

269
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,359
 Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!

270
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,079
 Nick! Nick!
 His mate is chatting up Bridget.

271
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,319
 Right, that's it! I'm going in!

272
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!

273
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 Muscles, you're fired!
 And so is your friend!

274
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,959
 That was great!

275
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,960
 I didn't even see J- Lo.

276
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,159
 See, Hector? I knew you weren't a wimp.

277
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,318
 Next time in Extra,

278
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,319
 Annie is revising for her exams,

279
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,918
 Bridget has a makeover,

280
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,919
 and guess who is coming to stay?

281
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:52,278
 andguess who is coming to stay?

1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,118
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,078
 who share a flat in London.

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,958
 And the boys next door,

4
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,959
 Nick, and his friend Hector,
 from Argentina.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,398
 Annie loves Hector
 and Hector loves Annie.

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 And Bridget and Nick are going out,
 most of the time.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 So, will the happy couples stay together?

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 Find out in Extra.

9
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,679
 Chocolate mousse!

10
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,799
 Peanut butter!

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,718
 Strawberry yogurt.

12
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,719
 Nice.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 Sorry, Annie. Exams. I forgot!

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 I won't make a sound.

15
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,119
 Sorry, Annie. I...

16
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,638
 Hector! Stop.

17
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,639
 Do not eat that apple.

18
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,079
 Sorry. You want it, Annie?

19
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
 No, Hector! It's too noisy!

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,519
 I am trying to revise!

21
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 My exams are next week!

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
 I need some classical music.

23
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,159
 Sorry, Annie, I...

24
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,879
 Help!

25
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,119
 Annie!

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
 Help!

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 Help!

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Annie?

29
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,919
 Annie!

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 Why is Hector
 hanging out of the window?

31
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,719
 Poor Hector!

32
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,439
 -  Hector, are you OK?
 -  Yeah.

33
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 The window is dirty.

34
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 Well, then, it's a job
 for a window cleaner, not you!

35
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 Hey, guys, look at these!

36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 It's pictures of my makeover!

37
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 What is a makeover?

38
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,599
 It's when they use make- up to turn this...

39
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,679
 into this!

40
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,239
 Just joking!

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,958
 Bridget, they're fantastic!

42
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,199
 You look like a film star!

43
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Cameron Diaz, watch out!

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 Were you wearing lots of makeup?

45
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,199
 No.

46
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,518
 Anyway, what are they for?

47
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,519
 Well, Nick wants to be
 a Hollywood movie star

48
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 and if he can do it, I can do it!

49
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,918
 Really?

50
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,919
 You are going to tell George Ducas
 about me?

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 What, the George Ducas,
 the Hollywood director?

52
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
 You're going to tell him
 what a great actor I am?

53
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,958
 Oh, Victoria!

54
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,959
 Thank you so much!

55
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 How can I thank you?

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 Can't anyone else do it?

57
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,559
 Yes! Of course
 I want you to tell George about me!

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,999
 No problem.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,159
 See you later.

60
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,160
 Ciao.

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 That was my friend, Victoria Yallop,
 the really good actress.

62
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,519
 Yeah, she's a really good actress.

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
 Nick, darling!

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 Well, guess what?

65
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,439
 She's going to tell George Ducas,
 the Hollywood director, all about you.

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,680
 -  Yeah! How did you know?
 -  Lucky guess.

67
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 And what do you have to do for her?

68
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,199
 Nothing.

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 She wants me
 to look after something for her.

70
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,319
 Victoria Yallop. Nick is expecting me.

71
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,199
 Nick, darling!

72
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
 This must be so much trouble for you!

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,318
 No problem. No problem at all.

74
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,278
 Sweet! OK, three rules.

75
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,279
 No meat, clean underpants in the morning
 and in bed by eight.

76
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,198
 Now meet...

77
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,598
 Where are you?

78
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,599
 Come here!

79
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,119
 Nick, meet Lucas.

80
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,319
 Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

81
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,439
 Hi.

82
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 Good joke!

83
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,359
 Well, I must dash.

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
 George is waiting for me.

85
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,519
 Don't worry, Nick,
 I'm going to tell him all about you!

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
 Lucas, be a good boy
 for Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

87
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,358
 Don't tell me.

88
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:23,359
 Nightmare On Elm Street.

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 Goodbye, darlings! Goodbye!

90
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,319
 I'm hungry.

91
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,198
 Nick?

92
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,199
 What is going on?

93
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,239
 Victoria's au pair
 has run off with the postman.

94
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,358
 So?

95
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,359
 So, she's got no one to look after Lucas.

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
 So, why can't she look after her own son?

97
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Because
 she's going to meet George Ducas.

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,558
 -  Where?
 -  New York.

99
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,399
 -  New York?
 -  She'll be back tomorrow!

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 Tomorrow?

101
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 He's very sweet
 but what about my exams?

102
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,799
 He won't be a problem.
 You won't even notice him.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 We'd better not.

104
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 Hector! Stop.

105
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,119
 Say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,319
 Annie, have you seen these?

107
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,239
 You showed me earlier.

108
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,238
 No.

109
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,239
 Look.

110
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 It's that...that child!

111
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,559
 What's that noise?

112
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,638
 Lucas is playing ball.

113
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,639
 Oh, is he?

114
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,639
 You've made me do that.

115
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,599
 He's on my bike!

116
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 I know. Just don't go in the bathroom.

117
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
 I said don't go in the bathroom.

118
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:53,479
 And I don't know what he's done
 with the toilet paper.

119
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
 Poor Charley.

120
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,838
 I'm hungry.

121
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,839
 Nick, where have you been?

122
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 Shopping for Lucas.

123
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,799
 Nick, you must take control of him.

124
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,238
 Baby, I'm trying!

125
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,718
 Nick, I'm trying to work.

126
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,719
 I'm trying to revise for my exams.

127
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,640
 OK, OK. Very nice, Lucas.

128
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,999
 Maybe later?

129
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I know. Let's play games.

130
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,719
 -  I've got Twister.
 -  Great.

131
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
 Oh, OK, boys versus girls.

132
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,119
 So,
 I'll just move my left foot over to you.

133
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,918
 It is stuck!

134
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,919
 OK, I'll move my hand.

135
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
 Hey, I can't move!

136
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,639
 Nor can I!

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,519
 What's happening?

138
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 Lucas? What have you done?

139
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
 Lucas, come here!

140
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,839
 Lucas! Come on!

141
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,078
 Lucas!

142
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,079
 Please.

143
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 I'm going to tell him all about you!

144
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,518
 I'm hungry.

145
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,519
 I'm hungry.

146
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,438
 Hi, Lucas! Where have you been?

147
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,238
 To the zoo.

148
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,239
 -  Where's Nick?
 -  He had to take the penguin back.

149
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,679
 -  The penguin?
 -  Yeah. It must have fallen into my bag.

150
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,399
 What are you listening to?

151
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 I said, what are you listening to?

152
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,879
 Dog Puppy Dog.

153
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 Can I listen?

154
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 This is good!

155
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,038
 Sorry!

156
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,919
 Hector!

157
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 Lucas! Come here!

158
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 Lucas, why are you so...

159
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 Hey, that's me!

160
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,399
 Lucas, do you want to be like me?
 A news reporter?

161
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,878
 Well, to be a good news reporter

162
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,879
 you have to do everything exactly as I do.

163
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 All good newsreaders brush their teeth.

164
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,439
 Check.

165
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,799
 Comb their hair.

166
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,879
 Check.

167
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 -  And say good night.
 -  I'm hungry.

168
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
 Check. Good night.

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 Goodnight, sugar plum.

170
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,959
 Haven't you got a girlfriend, Lucas?

171
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 Girls are wonderful, especially Bridget.

172
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Girls are yuck, especially Bridget.

173
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:42,239
 Yeah, well, anyway, time for bed.

174
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 Nick, thank you for a lovely day.

175
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 Well, that's OK, little fellow.

176
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,359
 We'll have more fun tomorrow. Night night.

177
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 Sweet kid!

178
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,680
 How does he do that?

179
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
 I've had enough of you, you little...

180
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Now, sweetie, that was very good!

181
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,679
 But Auntie Bridget thinks
 you should stretch more like this!

182
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 Would you like a cup of tea?

183
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,958
 Hi, Nick!

184
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,959
 This is Joe. He was just telling me
 about window cleaning.

185
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,719
 So I see!

186
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,280
 So, you want my girlfriend, do you?

187
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
 Thanks, Lucas!

188
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,438
 Nick, Joe, stop!

189
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,439
 No! He started it!

190
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,239
 Nick, what are you doing?

191
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,439
 Electric shocks!

192
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,519
 Check!

193
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 How do you do that?

194
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,599
 Poor Joe!

195
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
 I haven't paid him! Joe!

196
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,680
 Has Bridget just run off
 with the window cleaner?

197
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,318
 Yep!

198
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,319
 Cuckoo! Anybody home?

199
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,039
 Lucas, my darling, I'm back!
 Give your mummy a hug!

200
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,078
 -  How was George?
 -  Wonderful!

201
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,079
 So, did you tell George about, you know?

202
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,638
 You know?

203
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,759
 What?

204
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 Did you tell George Ducas about me?

205
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,639
 What a good actor I am.

206
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,678
 I'm so sorry, darling.

207
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,598
 I completely forgot!

208
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,599
 It was all so exciting!

209
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,399
 Lucas, you're going to have a new daddy!

210
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,078
 George and I are going to be married.

211
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,079
 I'm going to be Mrs George Ducas.

212
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
 Hey! That means
 you are going to be Lucas Ducas!

213
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,360
 Lucas, come with me
 and meet your new daddy.

214
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,480
 See? Girls are yuck!

215
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,959
 Next time in Extra...

216
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,039
 Bridget gets a new computer,

217
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,039
 the boys get competitive,

218
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 and Annie gets a surprise.

219
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,519
 and Annie gets a surprise.

1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,959
 Annie and Hector are dating

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
 and Bridget and Nick were dating,
 but that's history.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 Now all Nick wants is a job,
 a babe or a motorbike.

6
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,038
 He's not fussy.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,039
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,119
 Oh, darling, no. I'll die without you.

9
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,039
 He's Robert. He ran away with Jenny.

10
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,878
 Oh, no!

11
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,399
 That's why she can't marry Lionel.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 -  That is so sad.
 -  I know.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 But doesn't Jenny know
 that Lionel is her brother?

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,198
 She had a car accident.

15
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,479
 She can't remember.

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 That is terrible!

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,599
 Quick, quick, quick, quick!

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,558
 Go on! Kick it! Kick it!

19
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,319
 Football! Hi, boys.

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,798
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Bridget.

21
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
 -  I need your help.
 -  Sure. What is it?

22
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,559
 I'm going to buy
 a new computer for work.

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,799
 I know everything about computers.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,119
 Great!

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 I need one with a lot of gigabytes,
 good RAM memory,

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
 all the software compatibility
 and the top processor.

27
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,079
 Maybe this one?

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 No, this one hasn't got what she wants.

29
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,559
 And you understand what she wants?

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 Yeah. You don't?

31
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,679
 -  Of course I do.
 -  Well, so do I.

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,760
 So? Have you decided which one?

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,399
 Who's going to pay for it?

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
 It's for work, so they'll pay for it.

35
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,279
 -  This one, then.
 -  This one is the most expensive.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
 It's a nice colour.

37
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,598
 Well...

38
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,359
 It has everything you want.

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 Do you think more SDI sockets,
 or the analogue input?

40
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
 Forget it. I'll order it now.

41
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,679
 Come on, come on!

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,718
 What are you doing out here?

43
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,518
 Waiting for my examination results.

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,519
 Your results are arriving today?

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 What have you done to Teddy?

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 Brad Pitt is much more handsome
 than Teddy.

47
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,199
 Where is it?

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 Bill, bill, nothing, nothing, bill...

49
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,799
 It's not my examination results.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,958
 It's from the landlady.

51
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959
 It says we are too noisy.

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 Noisy?
 She's written to the wrong apartment.

53
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 We're never noisy.

54
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 My new computer's here!

55
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,359
 Well, Nick? Open it.

56
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,519
 -  Why me?
 -  Nails.

57
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,359
 Anything else?

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,360
 Well, it's a very big box.

59
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,078
 What's that?

60
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,399
 I think it's the instructions.

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 Great. Have fun.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,838
 Wait! Where are you going?

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,038
 Shopping.

64
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,039
 You'd better have finished
 when I get back.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,079
 Better have finished what?

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Installing the computer.

67
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,519
 You do know everything about computers,
 don't you?

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
 No problem.

69
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,039
 The instructions are all in English.

70
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,559
 Look... Hector, here's a Spanish version.

71
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,519
 Yes...

72
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,399
 Right, let's do it.

73
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,519
 Or don't you know how to do it?

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 I could do it with my eyes closed!

75
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 Well, instructions are for girls!

76
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,398
 Oh, yeah!

77
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,999
 I am the man!

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Yeah, but I did all the work.

79
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:35,238
 You? I did it.

80
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,239
 I am the computer king.

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 -  Yeah?
 -  Yeah.

82
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,359
 -  You think you can beat me?
 -  I already did.

83
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,079
 Computers are easy.

84
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
 How about a real challenge?

85
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,279
 Whatever challenge you like.

86
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,399
 Right...

87
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,199
 Man Olympics. Challenge One.

88
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,360
 Who can put the most marshmallows
 in his mouth?

89
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,039
 -  Marsh...
 -  ..mallows.

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
 -  Look. One.
 -  One.

91
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,919
 -  Two.
 -  Two.

92
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,438
 -  Three.
 -  Three.

93
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,439
 -  Four.
 -  Four.

94
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,040
 I'm going to buy a new computer for work.

95
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 No, this one hasn't got what she wants.

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 And you understand what she wants?

97
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 Come on, come on!

98
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,919
 Where is it?

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
 How about a real challenge?

100
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
 -  One.
 -  One.

101
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,399
 Well, instructions are for girls!

102
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,438
 What's that? Love letters?

103
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,439
 No, I've got all the letters
 delivered to this building.

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 You've got the neighbours' letters?

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,239
 I'm sure my examination results are here.

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Where are the boys?

107
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,838
 They've installed my computer!

108
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,839
 I think so.

109
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,399
 -  Is that normal?
 -  Bridget!

110
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,399
 Nick? Hector?

111
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,279
 What are you doing?

112
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 Man Olympics. Challenge Two.

113
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,678
 What kind of a challenge?

114
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,679
 Who can go the longest without...you know...

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
 Falling down? Sneezing? Jumping?

116
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,919
 No, no. Without going...

117
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,279
 Without doing...

118
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,238
 You want to spend a penny?

119
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:25,239
 Spend a penny?
 I don't want to go shopping!

120
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,399
 No, no, no. She means...

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
 Stop thinking about your challenge
 and follow me.

122
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
 Maybe I've passed!

123
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
 Maybe I've failed!

124
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 You're not going anywhere until it works.

125
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,719
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Here, let me try.

126
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 -  You think you can do better?
 -  I know I can do better.

127
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
 I know a way from my country.

128
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,999
 -  Really?
 -  Really.

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 My father taught me.

130
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
 Yes, we have that way in England too.

131
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 -  Hi, guys.
 -  Hi.

132
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,759
 Oh, no! What happened?

133
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,399
 -  It was like that before.
 -  It was not like that before.

134
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,998
 Sorry.

135
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,999
 What are you doing?

136
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,199
 Man Olympics. Challenge Three.

137
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
 Hi. I need a man.

138
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,398
 No, you idiot!

139
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,399
 I need a man
 to fix the computer I bought.

140
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,719
 Tomorrow? Good.

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 And I'd like him
 to be tall, dark, handsome...

142
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 Great, thanks. Bye.

143
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
 At last, a real man.

144
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 Hi, I need a man.

145
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,959
 It was like that before.

146
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
 -  It was not like that before.
 -  Sorry.

147
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
 It's Nick's phone.

148
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
 You have 23 new messages.

149
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,518
 Message one...

150
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,519
 Hi, bro.
 I've got all my friends to call you.

151
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,719
 I hear you and Bridget are history.

152
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
 That's great news.
 I didn't like her anyway.

153
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,518
 Message two...

154
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,519
 Hi, Nick. Izzie here.
 Melanie asked me to give you a call.

155
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,439
 I hear you and Bridget are history.

156
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,358
 Hello. What?

157
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,359
 Nicky Wick- wick is not here.

158
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Is that Emma?

159
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 Nick's told me all about you.

160
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 Yeah. You and your moustache.

161
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,559
 Nick!

162
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,599
 Mr Postman?

163
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
 Man Olympics. Challenge Five.

164
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,479
 Tug- of- war to see who is the strongest.

165
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,238
 They had a tug- of- war here?

166
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,239
 Yes. They are so stupid!

167
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
 -  Who won?
 -  I won.

168
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,239
 What's wrong?

169
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 I want my examination results.

170
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 -  Where's the post?
 -  Calm down.

171
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,319
 -  The postman!
 -  The computer man!

172
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
 Well, hello there.

173
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,159
 Come in!

174
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,878
 But...

175
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,879
 I know what you're going to say.

176
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,919
 -  But...
 -  It was like that when I bought it.

177
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,999
 So what do you think?

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It looks broken.

179
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 -  Well, can you repair it?
 -  No.

180
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,358
 -  You can't repair it?
 -  No.

181
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,359
 -  You don't know how to?
 -  No.

182
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,159
 Well, how can you be a repairman, then?

183
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,278
 I'm not.

184
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,518
 -  You're not a repairman?
 -  No.

185
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,278
 Well, what are you, then?

186
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,279
 I deliver special letters.

187
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,759
 My letter!

188
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,318
 Annie Taylor?

189
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,319
 -  Yes!
 -  This is for you.

190
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
 Man Olympics. New challenge.
 First one to get...

191
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 Annie's letter!

192
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,239
 It's mine!

193
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,079
 I can't look! You read it.

194
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,119
 Pass!

195
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
 Computer problem, miss?

196
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:19,599
 I can fix anything.

197
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,558
 My hero!

198
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,559
 Thank goodness you're here.

199
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,399
 How did he do that?

200
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,639
 -  Peter?
 -  Annie?

201
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
 -  It is you!
 -  Yes.

202
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,278
 He's Peter, an old friend.

203
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,279
 It was so clever of you
 to fix the computer.

204
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,399
 Good- looking and intelligent.

205
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,719
 A rare combination.

206
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,278
 Right!

207
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,839
 That's it!

208
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,438
 Man Olympics!

209
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,278
 New challenge.

210
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,038
 What challenge?

211
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,039
 Let's see who the real men are.

212
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,839
 Hector and me, or you two.

213
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,599
 -  OK.
 -  What's the challenge?

214
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,119
 -  Let us decide.
 -  Yes, we'll decide.

215
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,599
 Next time in Extra...

216
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,958
 Annie gets a new job.

217
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,799
 So does Hector.

218
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 And why does Nick
 become a beauty queen?

219
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,358
 And why does Nick
 become a beauty queen?

1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,440
 Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,559
 and Annie wants a job too,

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 but Nick just wants
 babes, babes and babes.

6
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,199
 'Dear Miss Taylor,
 thank you for your recent CV,

8
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,679
 'but at present we haven't got anything
 to suit your talents.'

9
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,879
 'Dear Miss Taylor...
 Blah- blah- blah- blah.'

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 How surprising.

11
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,519
 What is the point of all that studying
 if I cannot get a job?

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,278
 Right, last one.

13
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:39,279
 Paws crossed, Charley.

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 'Dear Miss Taylor...'

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 What is the point of having a car
 if you cannot park?

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,238
 'Thank you for your recent letter...'

17
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,239
 She's got four eyes and reptile skin.

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,479
 'We are very pleased to tell you...'

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 -  She sees your car...
 -  '..that you have been successful...'

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,160
 She slides over to it.

21
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,679
 She's got you!

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,199
 '..in your application as a...'

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
 Yes, she is the...

24
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,558
 Traffic warden!

25
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,398
 -  Correct.
 -  What?

26
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,719
 I've just got a ticket.

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 I've just got a job.

28
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,638
 As a traffic warden?

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,639
 -  Annie, you'll be one of them.
 -  One of who?

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,760
 Annie is going to be a traffic warden.

31
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 Well, I have to pass
 the entrance exam first.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 -  What is a traffic warden?
 -  Someone who spoils your day.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 A traffic warden is someone
 who stops stupid people

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,599
 parking their stupid cars
 in stupid places.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
 See? It's started.

36
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,479
 I didn't know
 you wanted to be a traffic warden.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 I didn't know either,
 but no one else would have me.

38
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,399
 But it is good for the environment
 to reduce the cars on our roads.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 -  So you will have another exam?
 -  Yeah.

40
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,399
 Another exam.

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,398
 Well, don't worry. I can help.

42
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,399
 I've got experience of traffic wardens.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
 OK, Hector, you can be the driver...

44
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,078
 and I will be the traffic warden.

45
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,038
 -  OK.
 -  You can't park there.

46
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,798
 -  Yes, I can.
 -  No, you can't.

47
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,958
 -  Yes, I can.
 -  No.

48
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,959
 Yes, I can, because this is a bus stop
 and I am driving a bus.

49
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,879
 The excuses I hear.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 Sorry, sorry.
 Emergency appointment.

51
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,559
 -  Bad leg.
 -  Which leg?

52
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,919
 No, no, no, it's not me. It's my hamster.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Sweet.

54
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 Sorry, Eric! Eric?

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
 Surely we can come to some arrangement?

56
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,438
 Of course we can, sir.

57
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,439
 You can pay for the ticket,
 I can go home for my tea.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
 and there wasn't a place to park.

59
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,398
 But surely we can sort this out?

60
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,399
 When a beautiful woman
 meets a handsome man...

61
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,679
 Well, you're in my little black book now,
 darling.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,558
 I've only been two minutes!

63
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,559
 Well, I have started...so I'll finish.

64
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,799
 Sorry, I got stuck up a chimney.

65
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
 Yes, and there are fairies
 at the bottom of my garden, sir.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,478
 Rudolph!

67
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,479
 Rudolph!

68
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 See? Now you know what to expect.

69
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 I can't wait.

70
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,479
 'Late ironing -  penalty £20.'

71
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:59,559
 'Late washing- up -  penalty £5.'

72
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
 Annie.

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 I need a drink.

74
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,239
 I don't believe it.
 She's clamped the fridge.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,959
 Did you have a good day, Bridget?

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 -  Yes, I did.
 -  Why is the TV moved?

77
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,839
 Annie towed it away this morning.
 No licence.

78
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,679
 Really, Hector, you must talk to her.

79
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,680
 She's too serious
 about this traffic warden exam.

80
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,199
 I do try, but if I stop to talk to her,

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,639
 she gives me a parking ticket.

82
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,398
 Anyway, exciting news.

83
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,399
 Channel Nine is presenting
 the Miss Euro babe Beauty Contest.

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,438
 And guess who Eunice wants
 to present the show.

85
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,318
 -  Me!
 -  You, Hector!

86
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,319
 I could enter the contest myself,
 but I might...

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
 -  Frighten the judges?
 -  Win.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,318
 The programme will need my expertise.

89
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
 And mine!

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
 -  So will you present the show, Hector?
 -  When is it?

91
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 -  Next Friday.
 -  That's the day of Annie's exam.

92
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,399
 A double contest, then.

93
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,839
 But you'll be OK. I'll help you.

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,238
 Think of those babes!

95
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,239
 It's my job to give you
 all the information about the girls,

96
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,279
 so nothing can go wrong.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
 -  Well, OK, then.
 -  Good. Great.

98
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,159
 So, when do we start?

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,519
 We?

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,478
 Well, Hector will need an interpreter

101
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,479
 to help him talk to all those babes.

102
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 Nick, you're not getting involved
 in this show.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 What is the point of having a car
 if you cannot park?

104
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,439
 -  What is a traffic warden?
 -  Someone who spoils your day.

105
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:27,359
 Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
 and there wasn't a place to park.

106
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,118
 And guess who Eunice wants
 to present the show.

107
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,119
 -  Me!
 -  You, Hector!

108
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,879
 -  Well, OK, then.
 -  Good. Great.

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 You have a very difficult job.

110
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,759
 You are right.

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 But a very important job.

112
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,318
 Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,239
 No, I mean it.

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 I know, but I've still
 got to give you a ticket.

115
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,959
 That's OK. It's your job.

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 There you are, sir. Have a nice day.

117
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,159
 Thank you. And you.

118
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,599
 How nice to meet a reasonable customer.

119
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,839
 Why are you dressed to go to war, Annie?

120
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 I'm going for my traffic warden exam.

121
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,399
 Are you expecting trouble?

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 There are a lot of difficult motorists
 out there.

123
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
 What have you got there?

124
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 It's the information
 for the Euro babe contestants.

125
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,759
 Hector must learn
 what each girl likes and dislikes.

126
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,359
 -  Anything interesting?
 -  Let's see.

127
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,159
 She likes children and animals.

128
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,079
 She likes children and animals.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 She likes children and animals.

130
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 This one's different. Miss Holland Babe.

131
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,959
 She likes reading and her ambition...

132
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
 is to learn to read.

133
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,919
 Here's another one. Miss Belgium Babe.

134
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,999
 Her ambition is to go to the moon.

135
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,679
 But she doesn't like flying.

136
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,240
 Well, it should be an exciting show.

137
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 I hope so.
 Well, at least Hector is ready for it.

138
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,839
 And so...

139
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,718
 am I.

140
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,719
 I said no.

141
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,558
 Cue Hector.

142
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,559
 Good evening
 and a very warm well...come

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 to Channel Nine's Eurobaby Contest live.

144
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,718
 Yes, OK. Get on with it.

145
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,719
 Have we got some lovely ladies
 for you tonight. Have we?

146
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,319
 Yes, of course we have.

147
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,399
 Yes, yes, we have. Of course we have.

148
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,359
 So let's meet our lovely contestants

149
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,799
 eager to wear
 the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

150
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,639
 Nick, get off now.

151
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,639
 Nick! Get off now!

152
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
 If you don't get off
 by the time I count to three,

153
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,918
 I will cut off your ears.

154
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,919
 One...two...

155
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,638
 Comedy!

156
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,678
 Cue Miss Swedenbabe.

157
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,679
 So let's meet our first contestant.

158
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 Miss Swedenbaby!

159
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 This is why I didn't want you here.

160
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,918
 What's that?

161
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,919
 Miss Englandbabe is where?

162
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
 She's been clamped?

163
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:29,119
 Well, tell her to get a taxi, then.

164
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 She won't leave her Porsche?

165
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,799
 I'll come and get her.

166
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 Who's going to do this?

167
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,639
 Listen to me.

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
 You have one simple job.

169
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,359
 You must tell Hector who each girl is.

170
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
 Their names are on these cards. Got it?

171
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,759
 Do not mess it up.

172
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,839
 Who? Me?

173
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,159
 Thank you, Miss Swedenbaby!

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Miss Finlandbabe!

175
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,799
 Miss Finlandbaby!

176
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,759
 Well, good luck with the elephants.

177
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,359
 Thank you, Miss Finlandbaby.

178
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,199
 Miss Spainbabe!

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 Miss Spainbaby!

180
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 You are not Miss Spainbaby.

181
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,639
 So, Miss Italybaby,

182
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,920
 it says here that your hobbies
 are children and animals.

183
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,799
 Fascinating.

184
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,559
 Yes! It's your favourite traffic warden.

185
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 It's...me!

186
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:19,479
 I passed!

187
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 Where is everybody?

188
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,039
 The Eurobabe Contest.

189
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,759
 Well, good luck with the dolphins.

190
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Thank you, Miss Italybaby.

191
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 Miss Hungarybaby!

192
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 Are you Hungary? Are you Hungary?

193
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,519
 You are not Miss Hungarybaby.

194
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 So welcome, Miss...oh, no.

195
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
 -  How's it going?
 -  Very well. No problems.

196
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,399
 She's a bit emotional, I think.

197
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,919
 We've got big problems.

198
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,839
 Miss Englandbabe will not come here.

199
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,478
 -  She's broken a nail.
 -  Nasty.

200
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,479
 But we've got to have
 a Miss Englandbabe. We are in London.

201
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,920
 Yes, Eunice? Right away, Eunice.

202
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,438
 Eunice wants to see me. Now.

203
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,439
 Think of something, Nick, and fast.

204
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,559
 ..eager to wear
 the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

205
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
 Miss Englandbabe is where?

206
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,479
 Miss Spainbabe!

207
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
 Think of something, Nick, and fast.

208
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,559
 She's a bit emotional, I think.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 -  She's broken a nail.
 -  Nasty.

210
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 And we come to our last contestant

211
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 in this fantastic Eurobaby Contest.

212
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,919
 Last but not least, it is...

213
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,439
 It is...

214
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,479
 Of course!

215
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,480
 It is Miss Englandbaby!

216
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,559
 Welcome, Miss England...

217
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,119
 -  Welcome.
 -  Thank you. Thank you.

218
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:21,439
 Well, let's find out about you.

219
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,478
 You like pizzas...

220
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,479
 rock 'n' roll and motorbikes.

221
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 My kind of girl!

222
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 And dancing with women.

223
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 I think you mean men. Dancing with...

224
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,239
 Nick!

225
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,039
 What do you think you're doing?

226
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,040
 You said you needed
 a Miss Englandbaby fast.

227
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,439
 I meant a woman.

228
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,438
 -  Nice legs, Nick.
 -  Thanks, Annie.

229
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,439
 -  Hi, Annie.
 -  Thank you, Miss Englandbaby.

230
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
 And next, we find out why our babies

231
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,159
 want to represent their country.

232
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,558
 There are beautiful women everywhere.

233
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,319
 I know!

234
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,919
 Miss Englandbabe is still missing.

235
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,958
 What are we going to do?

236
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,959
 Eunice said she'll fire me
 if I don't find someone.

237
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:32,199
 Oh, no! No.

238
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,759
 Bingo!

239
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,559
 I hear we have a replacement
 for our last contestant.

240
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 It is the new Miss Englandbaby!

241
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 So tell me, Miss Englandbaby...

242
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:05,879
 why do you want
 to represent your country?

243
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,558
 I want to represent England

244
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,559
 because I care
 about the environment, pollution.

245
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 I care about people.

246
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,119
 And I have great legs.

247
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,999
 And the winner of the Channel Nine
 Eurobaby Contest is...

248
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,039
 Miss Englandbaby!

249
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
 Congratulations, Annie! You did it!

250
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,239
 You are the most beautiful
 traffic warden in Europe!

251
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 Next time in Extra...

252
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,198
 Nick gets a job in a kung fu movie.

253
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:17,199
 Bridget nearly loses her job.

254
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:20,719
 And what happens
 when Annie meets a new man?

255
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:21,919
 And what happens
 when Annie meets a newman?

1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Bridget work in television.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,359
 Annie is a traffic warden.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,559
 And Nick is an actor

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 and one day he may be a star...
 or maybe not.

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,119
 Find out in Extra.

8
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,399
 Ricky Chung -  so sexy!

9
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,119
 -  Ricky Chung?
 -  You know.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,198
 I hate violence.

11
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:26,199
 I hate violence too...
 but I love Ricky Chung.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,040
 Hector, I tell you,
 this is a very old English tradition.

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,119
 -  Really?
 -  Really.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 Now, put your blindfold on.

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 No looking, OK?

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,398
 What is Nick doing?

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,399
 You know, being a genius.

18
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,598
 Right.

19
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,599
 Right, now you can choose one.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,399
 Nick, what are you doing?

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,199
 -  Our floor!
 -  Well...

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
 We must teach Hector
 how to be English.

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,719
 Not an English idiot.

24
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,759
 OK, Nick, now is your turn.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 And this is an old English tradition?

26
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,999
 Absolutely. You need a shower!

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 I think I already have had one.

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 -  That'll be for me.
 -  How do you know?

29
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
 Hello.

30
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,718
 Yes, it is for you, Nick.

31
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,438
 Naturally.

32
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,439
 Hello. Hi.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,679
 Yeah?

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,278
 Yeah!

35
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,598
 Really? Great!

36
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,079
 I'll prepare for it. Bye.

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 Nick, why do you always
 use our number?

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,198
 You're so, so...

39
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,199
 Idiotic? Stupid? Vain? Choose one.

40
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,079
 I have just got an audition for the new...

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,879
 Ricky Chung film!

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,639
 As I was saying,

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
 you're so clever, wonderful, brilliant.

44
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,559
 -  Ricky Chung.
 -  Yeah.

45
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,119
 Ricky Chung.

46
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,959
 I always knew you'd make it to the top.

47
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,599
 Ricky Chung.

48
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,719
 Nick's going to be in a film...
 with Ricky Chung!

49
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,479
 Wait a minute.
 He only has an audition.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,999
 Oh, I'm sure he'll get it.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Then I can interview Ricky Chung.

52
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,078
 Maybe Ricky'll fancy me.

53
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,079
 You? In your dreams!

54
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,199
 Ricky and Bridget.
 Houses in London, Hong Kong...

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
 Yeah, you'll have a house in London

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 and he'll have a house in Hong Kong.

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
 I should get an oriental style.

58
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,319
 New clothes. Come shopping with me?

59
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
 I can't.

60
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,678
 You can't come shopping?

61
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,719
 I have a group meeting.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,639
 Animal Lovers Against Violence.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,038
 And is Hector going with you?

64
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,039
 -  Hector.
 -  What about Hector?

65
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,559
 Well, I've been thinking
 about our relationship.

66
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,119
 Wimp!

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
 But Hector's a good man!

68
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,358
 He ironed your trousers!

69
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,278
 Yes.

70
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,279
 Yes, he did.

71
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,559
 Hello.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
 Hello, Bridget. How are you?

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
 Eunice! Very well, thanks.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 Good.

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
 Channel Nine has to lose people.

76
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,279
 I know. I heard.

77
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,280
 And guess who is the first person to go.

78
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,398
 Who?

79
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,358
 You. You're fired. Ciao!

80
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,359
 Wait!

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 But I'm getting an interview
 with Ricky Chung.

82
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,439
 Ricky Chung?

83
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,559
 If you get the interview,
 you keep your job. No pressure.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,159
 Hi, Annie.

85
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 I've just been watching
 Charlotte's Kitchen on television.

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
 Not again!

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
 Look, I've made you a cake.

88
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,079
 A cake? Really?

89
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,479
 Here, try a piece.

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 OK.

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 -  What's this?
 -  Flower.

92
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,639
 Flower? Why?

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 Well, Charlotte said
 you have to put some flower in the cake.

94
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,958
 No, Hector.

95
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,959
 Some flour.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Some flowers.

97
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,079
 Well, still...

98
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 Tastes good, doesn't it?

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,999
 Hey, Hector.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I have got an audition
 for the new Ricky Chung film.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 -  Superb!
 -  Superb!

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
 One question. Who is Ricky Chung?

103
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,239
 You know. Ricky...

104
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,678
 Chung.

105
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,278
 -  Ricky Chung.
 -  Yeah!

106
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,279
 I know him! He was
 in the Chinese restaurant, wasn't he?

107
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 No. No, no, no! Look...

108
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 I will show you Ricky...

109
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
 Chung!

110
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,599
 So, will you help me to prepare?

111
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,959
 I would love to.

112
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
 Ricky Chung film.

113
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,479
 -  Superb!
 -  Superb!

114
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,559
 -  What's this?
 -  Flower.

115
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,079
 Then I can interview Ricky Chung.

116
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
 Ricky and Bridget.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 I hate violence. Violence makes me sick.

118
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,239
 Wonderful. I totally agree, Richard.

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,278
 But I love animals.

120
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,799
 I love animals too.

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 You must come and meet my dog Charley.

122
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
 -  We have so much in common.
 -  I know.

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,279
 Hector...

124
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
 Come and sit down.
 I think we should talk.

125
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,519
 OK.

126
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 What do you want to talk about?

127
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,239
 I think we should see other people.

128
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,479
 See other people?

129
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
 But I see other people. I see Bridget,
 I see Nick, I see the postman.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 No, I mean we should...

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 see other people.

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 Fine.

133
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,799
 Guys, help me prepare
 my interview with Ricky Chung.

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 -  Bridget, it's not a good time.
 -  No, no.

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
 It is a very good time.

136
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,919
 Sit down, Bridget.

137
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,639
 -  So, you are Ricky Chung.
 -  I am Ricky Chung.

138
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 -  Yes.
 -  And who are you?

139
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,879
 I'm me, silly!

140
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,319
 So, Ricky...

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 What kind of...women do you like?

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
 Well, I like beautiful women...like you.

143
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,319
 Correct answer!

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,278
 And tell me, Ricky...

145
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,279
 Do you...have a girlfriend now?

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,360
 Well...

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,439
 Sweetie?

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 Oh, Ricky.

149
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,598
 Hector...

150
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,599
 hold this.

151
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,238
 Thanks.

152
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,239
 Now...I want you to attack me.

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 -  Attack you?
 -  Yeah.

154
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,359
 -  Not now.
 -  So when?

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
 It must be a surprise.

156
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
 -  Why?
 -  So I must always be ready.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
 Good. Very good!

158
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 I am feeling good!

159
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 I'm feeling fit!

160
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,319
 Nick, are you being violent?

161
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,638
 No.

162
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,639
 Thanks. Must go. It's my audition.

163
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,279
 OK, Nick.

164
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,238
 OK, Nick!

165
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,239
 Let's see what you can do.

166
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,599
 Excellent. Excellent.

167
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,798
 -  What?
 -  You've got the part.

168
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,799
 I have? Yes!

169
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
 Next.

170
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 Hey, baby.

171
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,599
 Nick.

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 You are looking at the new Ricky Chung.

173
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 Nick, that's wonderful.

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Ricky... Ricky Chung!

175
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,680
 What are you doing? Are you crazy?

176
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,758
 But you told me to attack you.

177
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,759
 But not now.

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 Not now!

179
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,878
 Amateurs!

180
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,359
 So...

181
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,758
 -  When can I?
 -  What?

182
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,159
 -  Meet him!
 -  Who?

183
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 Ricky Chung!

184
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,278
 But I love animals.

185
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,279
 I love animals too.

186
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
 Hector.

187
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,119
 I am feeling good.

188
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,519
 So when?

189
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,479
 Ricky Chung.

190
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
 Hi, I'm Nick.

191
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 Nick, Ricky never talks at work.

192
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Very professional.

193
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
 So what do you want me to do?

194
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 -  You just stand still.
 -  OK.

195
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,038
 Excellent.

196
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,278
 What is this?

197
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,279
 -  This is your role.
 -  But we are partners.

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,638
 Partners?

199
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,639
 Yes, we fight the criminals together.

200
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,519
 No, no, no. You play the stupid friend.

201
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
 -  The stupid friend?
 -  Exactly.

202
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,879
 Right, let's try it again.
 Ricky, action.

203
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,639
 So how was your first day with Ricky?

204
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
 Great! We get on very well.

205
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,359
 There must be so much to learn.

206
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,479
 Yeah! I taught Ricky a lot today.

207
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,879
 -  OK, Nick. Bend over.
 -  Excuse me?

208
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,438
 I said bend over.

209
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 I thought so.

210
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,558
 Hello, nurse.

211
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,559
 Could I have a bath, please?

212
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,119
 Hi, Bridget.

213
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,879
 So, when can I meet Ricky?

214
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,118
 No Ricky?

215
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,079
 No interview.

216
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,080
 No interview -  no job!

217
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,839
 Poor Nick.

218
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,038
 Nick, how are you feeling?

219
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,119
 -  Ricky!
 -  Richard?

220
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,759
 Annie?

221
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 What are you doing here?

222
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 This is Richard.
 I met him at my protest group.

223
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,839
 Ricky Chung!

224
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
 Please...please can I have an interview?

225
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,319
 Bridget, this isn't Ricky Chung,
 this is Richard.

226
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,759
 No, no, no. This is Ricky Chung.

227
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,118
 Richard?

228
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,119
 Yeah. Ricky Chung is my film name.

229
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
 But I thought you hated violence.

230
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
 You lied to me!

231
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
 Ricky!

232
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
 -  I brought you some cake.
 -  Thanks, Hector.

233
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,239
 Hector, will you forgive me?

234
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,919
 Of course.

235
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,478
 How fascinating.

236
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:06,479
 Anti- violence, and a kung fu star!

237
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 It'll make a great interview.

238
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,519
 Eunice will love it!

239
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,999
 And so will I.

240
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,239
 Next time in Extra...

241
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,679
 Charley enters a dog show.

242
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,599
 Bridget's got a new boyfriend.

243
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
 And guess who's in trouble with the police.

244
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,279
 And guess who's in trouble with the police.

1
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,078
 They have a neighbour, Nick,

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,198
 who likes Bridget.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,919
 But Annie likes Nick.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 That is until Hector arrives from Argentina,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
 and Hector is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,639
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 Oh. Argentinian.

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,239
 Maybe...

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,839
 Hector, please,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 call me Gigi.

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 'Oh, Hector, call me Gigi.'

13
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,439
 -  A.
 -  Is Hector still asleep?

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Yep.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
 Hector, wakey- wakey.

16
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,799
 Come on. Rise and shine.

17
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 Sweet.

18
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,758
 Good morning.

19
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,198
 Oh, good morning.

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,838
 No, no, no. Good morning.

21
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,878
 -  Ah- ah- ah.
 -  Oh.

22
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,559
 Good morning.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,438
 Ah- ah- ah.

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,119
 No, Hector.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,078
 -  I have a cold.
 -  And so have I.

26
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,318
 Oh, you have a cold, Bridget.

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
 Yes, I have a cold.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
 Yes. We have a cold.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,919
 So let's begin again.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,678
 Good morning.

31
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,918
 Good morning.

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,159
 Oh, never mind.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 Hector, would you like some...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 new pyjamas?

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 Hector, please excuse me for a moment.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 Pssst. Annie. Bathroom.

37
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,679
 Now.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 -  Good morning.
 -  Good morning.

39
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,839
 Is it fancy dress?

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,878
 Fancy dress?

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,318
 Yes.

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,519
 Oh. Nice.

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,158
 Hey.

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,199
 Nice car, eh?

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,679
 I have this car at home.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 Wow. You have this car at home?

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,079
 Girls must love you.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,038
 Girls?

49
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,039
 -  No.
 -  No?

50
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,719
 Hector, can I tell you something?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,679
 OK.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 The car looks good.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,878
 Yeah?

54
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,879
 So you must look good too.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,798
 -  I look good.
 -  No.

56
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 You don't look good.

57
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,879
 But I can help.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,398
 OK.

59
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
 OK.

60
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,679
 Yes.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 -  Hector's clothes are awful.
 -  They're so old- fashioned.

62
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,519
 I know. I'll take him shopping.

63
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,559
 But, Bridget, you are so busy.
 I'll take him shopping.

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,359
 -  No, it's all right, I'll take him shopping.
 -  It's no problem, I'll take him.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 I said I'll take him shopping!

66
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,959
 You need...

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,638
 You need a...

68
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Well, hi, babe.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,118
 -  Oh, it's you, Nick.
 -  Oh, hi, Nick.

70
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,119
 Hector has asked me what clothes to wear.

71
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,839
 Yeah, right.

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 You need a look

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
 like on a fast bike.

74
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,198
 No, no, no, Hector, don't listen to Nick.

75
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,118
 -  Listen to me.
 -  OK.

76
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,119
 You need a designer look.

77
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,959
 No, no, no, Hector, that's not for you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,398
 You need,

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,399
 you need...a cowboy look.

80
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,919
 -  No, no. A leather jacket.
 -  A bandanna and a vest.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,918
 A denim shirt.

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,158
 -  A motorbike.
 -  Designer.

83
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,478
 Cowboy.

84
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,919
 Stop.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
 OK.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,598
 I will go shopping.

87
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,798
 -  What?
 -  On your own?

88
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,799
 But...you need us.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,678
 How? What will you say?

90
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,238
 Er...

91
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,679
 It's OK. Leave it to me.

92
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 I am the shopkeeper, you are the customer.

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,158
 -  Uh?
 -  This is a shop.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,159
 -  I sell, you buy.
 -  Oh, OK.

95
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,519
 Ding- dong.

96
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,239
 Good morning.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,038
 Good morning.

98
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,079
 Can I help you?

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 Yes. I...

100
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,198
 I would like...

101
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,199
 Oh. I would like...

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
 a jacket, please.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,199
 Trousers.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,158
 I would like a pair of trousers, please.

105
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,159
 Oh, I would like a pair of trousers, please.

106
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,038
 And...

107
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,438
 a shirt.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,998
 No.

109
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,558
 Shoes.

110
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,559
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

111
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,759
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

112
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,719
 And a cat for my head.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I think you mean a hat.

114
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,159
 This is a cat.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,078
 A cat? A cat for my head.

116
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,079
 A cat for my head!

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,119
 Hector. Come shopping with me.

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,519
 -  Or me.
 -  No, me.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 -  He's my pen friend.
 -  All right.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,239
 I will go to the shoe shop.

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,438
 And I will go to the clothes shop.

123
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,038
 No, I'll go to the clothes shop.

124
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,039
 OK. I'll just buy the shirt.

125
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,118
 I'll buy the trousers.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,118
 Good.

127
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,318
 Good.

128
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,319
 Right. Let's go.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
 Oh, no. I completely forgot.

130
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
 We need eggs, lemons and dog food.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
 Oh, it's all right. I'll do it online later.

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 Oh, well done, Hector.

134
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,119
 Bye, Hector. Oh, and don't answer the phone.
 It might be the tarantula.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,918
 OK.

136
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,758
 Bye, Hector. Be good.

137
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,198
 And if you can't be good, be careful.

138
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,199
 -  Huh?
 -  Never mind.

139
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,599
 ..new pyjamas.

140
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,039
 I'll take him shopping.

141
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,199
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 You need a cowboy look.

143
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,279
 You need a look like on a fast bike.

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
 Good morning, sir.

145
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,958
 I would like...

146
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,959
 a cat for my head!

147
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,199
 A cat...

148
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Oh. Room service.

149
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,239
 Hello. I would like an egg for my head.

150
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,359
 Lemons for my head!

151
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,279
 -  Dog food for my head!
 -  Who's that?

152
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,999
 The tarantula!

153
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,559
 I said, 'Who's that?'

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,278
 -  Hello?
 -  Where's Bridget?

155
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,279
 Er... Where is Bridget?

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
 Me.

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,919
 I am Bridget.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,759
 I don't believe you.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Yes, I have a cold.

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,399
 -  Atchoo! Atchoo!
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Oh, thank you. Atchoo!

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,479
 Charley!

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,679
 Is that a dog?

164
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 No, no, it's not a dog, it's a...

165
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,239
 Annie. Yes.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Annie has a cold also.

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,598
 Oh, poor Annie.

168
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,039
 Thank you. Atchoo. Now goodbye.

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 Atchoo! Atchoo!

170
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,278
 Ole.

171
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,039
 I am Hector.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,919
 I speak English.

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.

174
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,119
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

175
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,518
 Oh, hi. Good afternoon, Annie.

176
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,359
 Good afternoon, Hector.

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,078
 I bought this for you.

178
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,478
 What is it?

179
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,159
 Try it on.

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,758
 Try...

181
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,918
 it...

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,278
 on.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,599
 Try...

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
 it...

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,718
 on.

186
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,719
 Oh. Try it on.

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,559
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In the bathroom.

188
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,558
 Good. I'll give this to him.

189
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 -  It's OK, I'll give it to him.
 -  No, it's all right.

190
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
 Hector.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,359
 Hector.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 I've got something for you.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,758
 Oh. OK.

194
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,759
 Come in.

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
 Spoilsport.

196
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Hector?

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,998
 Hector?

198
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,999
 -  Hello?
 -  Here are your clothes.

199
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,638
 You will look so cool.

200
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 -  Cool?
 -  Cool.

201
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,039
 Cool.

202
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,479
 Nice melons.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,079
 Melons? Who are those from?

204
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 I think Hector has been shopping online.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 I'm really thirsty. I need a drink.

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
 -  But we don't need any melons.
 -  Well, he did try.

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,478
 And he bought some eggs.

208
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,318
 Yeah.

209
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,319
 Just a few.

210
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,239
 Nice melons.

211
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 Just a few.

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Thank you.

213
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,398
 Try...

214
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,439
 it...

215
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 on.

216
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 I've got something for you.

217
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,839
 So how did Hector do the shopping?

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 Hector ordered ten melons
 instead of ten lemons.

219
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,679
 Oh, an easy mistake. He did try.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,319
 Yes, he did try.

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,039
 -  What about the eggs?
 -  OK. Eggs.

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,558
 You buy a dozen eggs, yeah?

223
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,599
 Yep. A dozen is ten.

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,559
 A dozen is 12, stupid.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,638
 I know.

226
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
 Well, Hector has put the number 12 here.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,118
 Well, that's OK. That's one box.

228
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,119
 No. He ordered 12 boxes.

229
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,159
 144.

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,118
 Now...dog food.

231
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,039
 I can't wait.

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
 OK. I'm ready.

233
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,479
 -  We're ready.
 -  Enter.

234
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,239
 Do you like it?

235
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,959
 Well?

236
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,679
 Er... I like the shirt.

237
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,239
 -  I like the sarong.
 -  I like the shoes.

238
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,278
 So...

239
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,799
 am I cool?

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,919
 Erm...

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
 No.

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,439
 I'm not cool.

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 Er...no.

244
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,679
 So...I will go shopping.

245
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,959
 Here we go again. Hector.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 You can't go out there on your own.
 You went shopping on the Internet.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,398
 Yes.

248
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Your ordered melons instead of lemons
 and too many eggs.

249
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,519
 -  Have you ever been to a supermarket?
 -  No.

250
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 My...

251
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,078
 Who are these?

252
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,079
 My...

253
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,239
 -  Servants?
 -  Yeah. My servants.

254
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,439
 -  Servants. Now I understand.
 -  Come on, Hector.

255
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 -  I will teach you how to shop, Hector.
 -  Till you drop.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,319
 Bridget and I will be the shopkeepers.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 And you are our customer.

258
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,559
 OK.

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,438
 -  Good afternoon.
 -  Good afternoon.

260
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,439
 Can I help you, sir?

261
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,319
 What would you like to buy?

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Oh. I would like some...

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,478
 Clothes.

264
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,479
 Yes. I would like some clothes, please.

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,919
 What size?

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,079
 What erm, erm...

267
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,518
 size?

268
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,518
 I don't know.

269
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
 I'll have to measure you, then.

270
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,279
 Arms up, please.

271
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,679
 Arms up, please.

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 Arms up, please.

273
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,999
 Chest.

274
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,758
 112 centimetres.

275
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,759
 Chest, 112 centimetres.

276
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:45,199
 And waist.

277
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,599
 82 centimetres.

278
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,678
 Waist.

279
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,518
 82 centimetres.

280
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,358
 And leg.

281
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,679
 -  I'll do that!
 -  No, it's OK.

282
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 I shall do that.

283
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,918
 Eight...

284
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,118
 y- seven centimetres.

285
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,919
 Now, do you like these trousers?

286
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,759
 Do you like this shirt?

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,198
 Yes.

288
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,199
 Good. That's erm...

289
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,999
 £5,000, please.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,678
 OK.

291
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,719
 No, no, no, Hector.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
 £5,000 is...

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,439
 is...

294
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,318
 8,000 dollars.

295
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,999
 Yeah.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's too much. It's too expensive.

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,439
 Not for Hector.

298
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,839
 So...

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I am ready to go shopping.

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,119
 -  Good luck.
 -  Yeah. Good luck.

301
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 You'll need it.

302
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 Where's my lemon drink, Nick?

303
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,759
 Nick, are there any more tissues?

304
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 All right. I'm coming as fast as I can.

305
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
 OK.

306
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,439
 Oh. I feel awful.

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 Me too. Nothing will make me feel better.

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 Can you get that, please, Nick?

309
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,759
 Ah, it's only Hector.

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,198
 Well?

311
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,199
 Is it...cool?

312
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 Wow, man. Well done, you look great.

313
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,559
 I would like a shirt, please.

314
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Excellent. Oh, the clothes are super.

315
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 And a pair of trousers.

316
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,679
 Oh. You are clever, Hector.

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 And a pair of shoes, please.

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I have been shopping!

319
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
 Oh, I'll get it.

320
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,838
 Hello?

321
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,879
 -  It's me.
 -  Oh, hello.

322
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,839
 It's the tarantula.

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,278
 How are you?

324
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,718
 -  Fine, thank you.
 -  Oh, good, good.

325
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,478
 -  How's your cold?
 -  How's my cold?

326
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 -  Well, how do you know I have a cold?
 -  You told me this morning.

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,118
 Me.

328
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,119
 -  I am Bridget.
 -  I don't believe you.

329
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,559
 Yes. I have a cold.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 -  Thank you.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

331
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,798
 Yes. Silly me.

332
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,598
 I told you this morning.

333
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,599
 Why are 400 tins of dog food here for Annie?

334
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,799
 Pardon?

335
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,839
 I don't know.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,398
 -  How strange.
 -  400 tins!

337
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,399
 Yes, that's a lot of tins. I really don't know.

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 -  Can you ask Annie?
 -  Yes, I'll ask Annie.

339
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Goodbye.

340
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,879
 The tarantula said

341
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 why are 400 tins of dog food downstairs?

342
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 400 tins?

343
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,119
 Hector...

344
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,639
 Next time in Extra...

345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
 Annie goes dating on the Internet,

346
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,839
 and so do Nick and Hector.

347
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

348
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
 But do they like their dates?

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,519
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,798
 Annie and Hector want to be together.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,799
 Bridget wants to meet a new man.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 And Nick wants to be rich and famous.

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 Charley, look at that.

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 Hola, Charley.

9
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,999
 What's wrong?

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,278
 Shaving cream!

11
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:34,279
 Whipping cream!

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,358
 Hector.

13
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,318
 Next time you go shopping...

14
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,038
 kitchen, bathroom, OK?

15
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:43,039
 Bathroom, kitchen, got it.

16
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,519
 What are you watching?

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,438
 It's a dog show.

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,039
 I like that!

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,638
 I didn't know you liked dogs.

20
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,559
 I don't like dogs.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 I like those women with their dogs.

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,319
 Charley likes the dogs.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 The lady dogs.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 You can enter the dog show this year
 and win two thousand pounds.

25
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,878
 What?

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
 Hector, slap me.

27
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:23,958
 Thanks.

28
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,878
 How much did she say?

29
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,879
 Two thousand pounds.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 We must enter this dog show with Charley.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,879
 All right, let's do it.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Yes!

33
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,439
 Oh, no!

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,958
 Hello. Earth to Bridget.

35
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,959
 Earth to Bridget.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,158
 Bridget!

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,158
 What are you looking for?

38
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,159
 My new T- shirt.
 I'm meeting my boyfriend...

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 What boyfriend?

40
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,839
 My new boyfriend.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,959
 Tell me everything.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,118
 Well...

43
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:31,119
 his name's Philip, he's very elegant and...

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,799
 Annie, we've had a really...

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,198
 good...idea!

46
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,278
 Wait.

47
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,279
 Careful.

48
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,719
 We've just seen a dog show on TV.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,319
 Yes, that's right.

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
 A really good dog show.

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,439
 Do you like dog shows, Annie?

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,039
 I...

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 hate them!

54
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,519
 They are cruel.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,479
 Not all dog shows, Annie.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,798
 Yes, Nick, all dog shows.

57
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,518
 They are... They are...horrible.

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,358
 You have to respect animals.

59
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,678
 Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,679
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You are so right, Annie.

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,398
 So what shall we do?

62
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,399
 We will have to train Charley ourselves,

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 without Annie knowing.

64
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,398
 Hey.

65
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,438
 Hey.

66
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,158
 Forget that.

67
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,638
 Read this.

68
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,558
 What? 'How to train your dog'.

69
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:03,559
 Now we can train Charley.

70
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,599
 Charley. Here, boy.

71
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,358
 Sit.

72
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,638
 Sit!

73
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,318
 Good dog.

74
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319
 Good trainer.

75
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,838
 Charley's not there.

76
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,679
 Charley's not there?

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,598
 Annie has taken him to the vet.

78
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,599
 -  The vet?
 -  The vet. The animal doctor.

79
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,399
 Well, we can still start training.

80
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,399
 We can? How?

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,838
 Sit!

82
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,278
 I said 'sit'.

83
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,719
 Sit.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,439
 Good boy, good boy.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,358
 Now roll over.

86
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,158
 Roll over.

87
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,918
 Good doggie, Charley.

88
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,359
 Roll over.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,319
 Roll over, Hector.

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,238
 Good boy!

91
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,519
 Good boy, Hector. Good boy.

92
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,078
 Now, now, I...

93
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,678
 -  I want to be the dog.
 -  No, no, I am the dog.

94
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,679
 I want...

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 -  I don't know these people!
 -  Hi, Bridget.

96
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,358
 Well, they're not my friends.

97
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,359
 What are they doing?

98
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,838
 Well, you've heard of yoga?

99
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,879
 Yes.

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Well, this is a new type of yoga -  dog yoga.

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,239
 Yeah, dog yoga.

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,240
 Do- ga.

103
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,438
 Fantastic!

104
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,439
 Come on, Bridget,
 introduce me to these spiritual boys.

105
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,078
 Philip.

106
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,878
 Hector and Nick.

107
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,919
 Hiya.

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
 Are dogs allowed on the sofa?

109
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,638
 Maybe we should eat out.

110
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,639
 Come on, Philip.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,559
 I don't like that man.

112
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
 I don't think he likes you either.

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,318
 Was that Bridget's new boyfriend?

114
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,319
 Yep.

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,078
 That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

116
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,079
 Top dog.

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 -  Tell me everything.
 -  Well...

118
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,479
 -  Let's do it!
 -  Yes!

119
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 Fantastic!

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
 Come on, Charley.

122
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,598
 Wait.

123
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,759
 Where are you taking him?

124
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,998
 For a walk.

125
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,999
 Time to train Charley.

126
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,798
 Let me take him.

127
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,799
 -  You'll take him for his walk?
 -  Yeah.

128
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
 OK.

129
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,159
 Where's the kettle?

130
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
 Bridget.

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,520
 I'll buy Charley a nice ribbon,

132
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 then the lady dogs will love him.

133
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,839
 Hey, Charley. Come on, walkies!

134
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 Hey, Nick. Catch!

135
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,719
 Bridget, that's my Walkman.

136
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,399
 Well, you take my things.

137
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,838
 I don't take your things.

138
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,678
 Yes, you do.

139
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,679
 Where's my necklace, then?

140
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,598
 I haven't got your necklace.

141
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,479
 Well, I think you have. And my photo frame.

142
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,558
 I haven't got your photo frame.

143
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,639
 -  Yes, you have.
 -  No, I haven't!

144
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,478
 -  Yes, you have!
 -  No, I haven't!

145
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,479
 Yes, you have!

146
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:34,038
 Girls, girls, please.

147
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,199
 Don't touch my things.

148
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,959
 Hello, hello.

149
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,919
 I didn't touch your things.

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Sit!

151
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,759
 Annie is so angry.

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,598
 What have you done?

153
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,278
 Me? Nothing.

154
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,519
 She has been fighting with Bridget.

155
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
 The girls have been fighting. I missed it.

156
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,438
 Anyway, how was your walk with Charley?

157
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,038
 Great.

158
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,718
 Women love Charley.

159
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,719
 Nick, what a handsome dog you have.

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 Look, I've brought him a ribbon for the show.

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
 -  And where is he?
 -  Where is who?

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
 Charley, the dog.

163
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,599
 Stay there, good boy.

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,120
 A quick pint.

165
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,679
 'You are too cruel to own a dog.

166
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,558
 'He is safe with me.'

167
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,559
 But he was only tied up
 at that lamppost for...

168
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,919
 ..a bit.

169
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,118
 What's going on?

170
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,119
 It's called...

171
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
 Dog yoga.

172
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
 Very nice.

173
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
 Oh, no. Not dog yoga again.

174
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,998
 Talking of dogs, where is Charley?

175
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,558
 -  He's asleep.
 -  He's ill.

176
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,999
 -  He's having his hair cut.
 -  He's busy.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So he's asleep and ill and busy,

178
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,599
 and having his hair cut?

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 Yeah.

180
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 OK.

181
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,919
 We have to get Charley back!

182
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,639
 Good boy.

183
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,640
 Good boy, good boy.

184
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,839
 Where is Charley?

185
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,239
 -  He's asleep.
 -  He's ill.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
 -  Having his hair cut.
 -  He's busy.

187
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,239
 I didn't touch your things!

188
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
 Where's my necklace, then?

189
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,199
 Nick.

190
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,719
 Hector, hey.

191
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,798
 Don't worry, I've found him.

192
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,799
 -  I've found him!
 -  Great!

193
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,199
 The other phone is ringing.
 See you later. Bye.

194
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
 Yeah!

195
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,398
 Hello?

196
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,918
 Police?

197
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,679
 What?

198
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,438
 You found our dog!

199
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,119
 Great, thanks very much.

200
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
 Bye.

201
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,358
 But...

202
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:33,359
 if the police have found our dog...

203
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 whose dog has Nick found?

204
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,879
 Sorry. I'm sorry.

205
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 Look, I'm sorry. I thought it was mine!

206
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,319
 Up, up, up.

207
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 Good dog. Up... Don't...

208
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,238
 Hello.

209
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,239
 Nick, where are you?

210
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
 The police station?

211
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,359
 You took a dog from an old woman?

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,878
 Nick, how could you?

213
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,318
 OK.

214
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,718
 OK.

215
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,719
 I am coming.

216
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 That woman, she really went for you
 and she was old!

217
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
 I thought she was Mike Tyson's mother.

218
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,879
 We must go, the dog show.

219
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,239
 Hi, guys.

220
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,518
 Hi, Charley.

221
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,519
 Why are you wearing that?

222
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,039
 We were taking photographs.

223
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,559
 -  Were we?
 -  Yes.

224
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 -  Taking photographs?
 -  Yes.

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I'm meeting Philip tonight
 and I can't find my earrings.

226
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,439
 Come on, they must be somewhere.

227
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,158
 You.

228
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,119
 You've stolen them.

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,679
 I told you, I haven't stolen anything.

230
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 -  Yes, you have. You're a thief!
 -  I am not a thief! I'm...

231
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 Whoa, ladies, no fighting here.

232
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,119
 Break it up!

233
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:05,079
 Where's the fridge?

234
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
 -  Hello and welcome to Croft's Dog Show.
 -  Bridget!

235
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 A dog show, how stupid.

236
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,279
 Where is the fridge?

237
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,278
 Where's Charley?

238
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,038
 Charley!

239
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,839
 Charley.

240
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
 Charley and the fridge have gone.

241
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 Charley has taken the fridge!

242
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 Well, it will be a great day here at Croft's,
 this annual event...

243
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,639
 Charley?

244
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 ..with the culmination of months of work
 for dog owners everywhere.

245
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 These dogs are trained to the highest standards
 and are a credit to their owners.

246
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,679
 It looks hopeful.

247
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,118
 Oh, yes.

248
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,119
 It looks very hopeful. Look at her!

249
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,118
 Look after Charley.

250
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,119
 Hey, hello there.

251
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 Look, there's Hector and Charley.

252
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 And there's Nick!

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
 Who's that woman?

254
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
 It's a very big dog.

255
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,238
 That really is a big dog.

256
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,239
 Yes, I know.

257
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 Your attention, please. The dog show winner is...

258
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,759
 Charley, with his trainers Hector and Nick.

259
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,238
 We've won, we've won!

260
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:49,239
 Two thousand pounds!

261
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:10,158
 Congratulations.

262
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,518
 Thanks, Annie.

263
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,238
 But you hate dog shows.

264
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,239
 Well, if Charley wins, then that's different.

265
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,158
 And you won two thousand pounds.

266
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,478
 Well, not exactly.

267
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,479
 We won two thousand pounds
 to spend in Dog's Heaven.

268
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,199
 This is great.

269
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
 Smells nice and...

270
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 gets rid of fleas.

271
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 I'm ready, Philip.

272
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,959
 Bridget.

273
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 You look nice.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We're going out for dinner,
 a very romantic dinner.

275
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,159
 You stupid dog, get off me!

276
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,719
 Charley, stop it!

277
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 -  What is he doing?
 -  Get off him!

278
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,479
 What?

279
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,879
 My scarf!

280
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,959
 My jewellery.

281
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,959
 My photo frame and more!

282
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,960
 Philip, you've been stealing our things.

283
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,999
 You're the thief.

284
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,518
 Well, I...

285
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,519
 I...

286
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:38,639
 Get him, Charley!

287
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,279
 Charley, Charley, Charley.

288
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,839
 He's a thief!

289
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,279
 Your boyfriend is a thief.

290
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 Well, who can blame him?

291
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,358
 He took souvenirs

292
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,039
 to remind him of me.

293
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 So romantic.

294
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:13,719
 Next time in Extra...

295
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,278
 Annie is a hypnotist.

296
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,158
 Nick and Hector are party entertainers.

297
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,159
 But what happens
 when they lose the birthday girl?

298
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:23,278
 But what happens
 when they lose the birthday girl?

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,278
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,798
 Bridget loves herself.

5
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,799
 And Nick loves babes, motorbikes and pizza

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,319
 but really needs to make some money.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,079
 You are feeling very sleepy.

9
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 You want to be a cat.

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,479
 Now, Charley, say meow.

11
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,119
 No, Charley, let's try again.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
 I give up.
 Here you are, Charley. Good boy.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 I don't need a dog,
 I need someone more stupid.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Perfect. The boys.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,198
 Hello, boys. Come and sit down.

16
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,199
 -  What are you doing?
 -  I am going to hypnotise you.

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,159
 Hypnotise?

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
 Yeah, you know. Hypnotise.

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,039
 You are feeling very sleepy.

20
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,759
 You are a baby.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,918
 Mama, mama.

22
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,718
 You are five years old.

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,719
 He stole my toy!

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,878
 You are 12 years old.

25
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
 Hey, baby, wanna dance?

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,038
 I know!

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,478
 It sounds fun.

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,479
 It's not about fun.
 Hypnotism can help you with your problems.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 I don't have any problems.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,479
 Are you ready?

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 Now, close your eyes and relax.

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,599
 I'm going to take you back.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,638
 Back.

34
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,639
 Back.

35
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,559
 And open your eyes.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,958
 You made it.

37
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,718
 -  Well?
 -  Have you done it?

38
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,878
 Yes, all done.

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,879
 Now, I am going to say a word to you

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,598
 and when you hear that word,

41
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,478
 you are going to react.

42
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,479
 Ready?

43
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,318
 Butterfly.

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,319
 Anything?

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,759
 No.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,760
 I'll try again.

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,158
 Butterfly.

48
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
 Butterfly.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,999
 Butterfly!

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 -  I don't think it's working, Annie.
 -  You're very good.

51
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,279
 No one can control
 the great minds of Hector and Nick.

52
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,159
 So where did I go wrong?

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,960
 'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'

54
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,519
 So if someone says the word 'butterfly'
 in the next two days...

55
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,919
 Oh, Nick!

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
 -  Why did you do that?
 -  It's so obvious!

57
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,838
 Sue is having an affair with Jim's brother.

58
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,318
 Don't tell me.

59
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,319
 Now it's time for
 On The Road with Bridget Evans...

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,399
 Look, it's Bridget.

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
 If I said 'children's party' to you,
 you'd say,,,

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,518
 No, thanks!

63
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,519
 ..jelly, ice cream, pass the parcel,
 pin the tail on the donkey.

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 Hey, pin the tail on the donkey.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,759
 Pin the tail on the donkey?

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 Great game.

67
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,878
 Poor donkey.

68
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,879
 But not for the lucky children
 of the rich and famous.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,718
 At their parties they have elephant rides,,,

70
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
 So they pin the tail on the elephant?

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 Amazing cakes, top- class entertainers.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 Parties like these
 can cost thousands of pounds

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 but listen to the laughter
 of these lovely children.

74
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,238
 They love it!

75
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,719
 -  Give me that.
 -  I want that!

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,678
 Not now, sweetie, I'm on television.

77
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,679
 -  But I want it.
 -  Be a nice child and go away.

78
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,279
 -  Give it to me!
 -  I said get lost!

79
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,438
 Mum, she hit me.

80
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,439
 This is Bridget Evans
 for Channel 9, Knights bridge.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,439
 Get the police, Mummy!

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 Will you keep your child quiet?

83
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,199
 -  That's it!
 -  What?

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,399
 Children's parties.

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,998
 Rich children's parties.

86
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,399
 You can't go, you are too old.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 No, she said top- class entertainers.

88
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,398
 That's us.

89
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,399
 We will be party entertainers to rich children
 for loads of money!

90
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,198
 Don't we need an elephant?

91
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,199
 No, we've got you.

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 You are feeling very sleepy.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,518
 Butterfly!

94
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
 I don't think it's working, Annie.

95
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,519
 'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'

96
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 We'll be party entertainers to rich children
 for loads of money.

97
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,279
 OK, guys, what do you think of this?

98
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,679
 'We are top- class children's entertainers.

99
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,559
 -  'We make them laugh...'
 -  We make them cry.

100
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,959
 It's not like that, Hector.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
 'Book Posh Parties
 for the best party in the world.

102
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,559
 'Only millionaires need apply.'

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
 -  What do you think?
 -  I think you'd be lucky to get one reply.

104
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,959
 Hello.

105
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
 Yes, this is Posh Parties.

106
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,799
 Who is calling, please?

107
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,919
 Mrs George Ducas?

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,279
 Not the wife of Mr George Ducas?

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 -  Who?
 -  George Ducas, the Hollywood director.

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,679
 You know who it is, don't you?

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,959
 Victoria, Lucas's mother.

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

113
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,398
 Hello.

114
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,399
 You'd like to book a party,
 for your stepdaughter?

115
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,998
 She loves fairies?

116
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
 Well, I have just the fairy for you.

117
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,159
 Princess Nicky.

118
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,719
 And here she is.

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
 Hello, Princess Nicky speaking.

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
 Yes, of course I know what little girls like.

121
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,919
 I used to be one myself, you know.

122
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,799
 Certainly, Mrs Ducas.

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 Daisy's birthday on Friday, we'll be there.

124
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,199
 Bye.

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,519
 Oh, no!

126
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,319
 Nick, that's fantastic news.

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,319
 -  It's your first booking!
 -  Yeah!

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 But I will have to go
 to the home of George Ducas

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,438
 dressed as a fairy princess!

130
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,439
 What will Victoria say?

131
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,639
 Who cares?
 This is my chance to get into Hollywood.

132
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,318
 It's the nearest you'll ever get to Hollywood.

133
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,998
 Anyway, what can you do?

134
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,999
 -  What can I do?
 -  What can you do to entertain children?

135
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,199
 I...can juggle.

136
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
 So can I.

137
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,599
 Is that it?

138
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 No, I can...do lots of things.

139
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,039
 Anyway, I will have my assistants,

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,479
 Hector and...

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 I'm working on Friday. She's not.

142
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,599
 -  Bridget.
 -  Oh, no, no.

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 Children and I do not work well together.

144
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,279
 Oh, well, suit yourself.

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
 It's only the home of George Ducas

146
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
 with the children of Hollywood stars.

147
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
 Celebrities?

148
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,679
 All right, but I'm not dressing up.

149
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,439
 -  I feel ridiculous!
 -  You feel ridiculous? What about me?

150
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,399
 There.

151
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 -  This is the last box.
 -  Great!

152
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,959
 Are you ready?

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
 Nick!

154
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,718
 Princess Nicky.

155
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,159
 Hi, Victoria. I mean...

156
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,079
 Hello, Mrs Ducas.

157
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
 So, how's the acting going?

158
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,798
 Great, great.

159
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,799
 This is just a temporary job.

160
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,878
 Is George here?

161
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,879
 He's next door, chatting to a few friends.

162
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,839
 Catherine Zeta- Jones,

163
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
 Orlando Bloom,

164
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,759
 Jude Law.

165
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,760
 That's nice.

166
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,998
 Well, let's bring in the birthday girl.

167
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,999
 Daisy, in you come.

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,038
 Have a good time.

169
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,039
 Anyway, I'm just going next door
 to have drinkies.

170
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 You'd like to book a party?

171
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,159
 -  I feel ridiculous!
 -  You feel ridiculous? What about me?

172
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 Have a good time.

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,158
 Hello, little fairies.

174
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,159
 My name is Princess Nicky.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Hello!

176
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,479
 And this is Princess Hector- ina.

177
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,719
 And this...is Tinkerbell.

178
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 She's really old.

179
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,679
 Now, Princess Hectorina
 is going to show you a magic trick.

180
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 Aren't you, Princess Hectorina?

181
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,959
 Now, we are going to have a magical time
 this afternoon, aren't we?

182
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 Now, would you like to meet Mr Whizzy?

183
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,799
 Of course you would.

184
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,118
 Come on, Daisy.

185
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,119
 Come and meet Mr Whizzy.

186
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 Now, Daisy, is Mr Whizzy in the hat?

187
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,039
 Go on, put your hand in.

188
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 Not too far!

189
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,078
 Well, is he there?

190
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,199
 No!

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,038
 No, he's not.

192
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,039
 Now, give the hat a magic tap.

193
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,038
 Careful!

194
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,039
 You'll give him a headache.

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Who is this?

196
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
 It's Mr Whizzy!

197
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 Say hello to Mr Whizzy.

198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 Mr Whizzy hasn't got any clothes on!

199
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,199
 Thank you, Daisy!

200
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
 Now, Tinkerbell,
 stop that and come over here.

201
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,079
 You've got hairy legs and a hairy chest!

202
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,879
 Now, Daisy, that's not a very nice thing
 to say about Tinkerbell.

203
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 I think she meant you.

204
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,279
 Now...

205
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,439
 I am going to make someone disappear.

206
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,239
 Who shall it be?

207
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,039
 You!

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
 Daisy, do you want to be
 part of the magic trick again?

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
 Hey, Daisy!

210
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,478
 Come on.

211
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,479
 Magic Wigwam!

212
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 Now, Daisy,
 this is Princess Nicky's magical wigwam.

213
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 If you go in there,
 you'll find a wonderful, magical land.

214
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,759
 -  Do you want to go in?
 -  No!

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Of course you do. Now, in you go.

216
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 Come on, poppet.

217
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,319
 Get in.

218
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,239
 There we are. Marvellous!

219
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 Now, we say the magical words - 

220
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,038
 Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky,

221
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,039
 hey, presto, ping!

222
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 Is Daisy still here?

223
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
 She's gone!

224
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 She must be having a wonderful time
 in the magical land.

225
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,399
 But it's time to come home now, Daisy!

226
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
 Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky, ping!

227
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
 And hello, Daisy.

228
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
 -  Where did she go?
 -  I don't know.

229
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,278
 I'll get the cake. She'll come out then.

230
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,279
 Where is she? Where is Daisy?

231
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,999
 What a good game, Princess Nicky!

232
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,479
 Can't you remember where Daisy is? Really!

233
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
 Your mind is like a butterfly's!

234
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,399
 Butterfly!

235
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,399
 The cake!

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 Come out, Daisy, wherever you are.

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 We've got a surprise for you.

238
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,518
 She'll come out when she sees this!

239
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,158
 Happy birthday, Daisy.

240
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,159
 Cue, Bridget!

241
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 What's going on?

242
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,718
 Annie?

243
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,399
 Bridget, I forgot to say,

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
 whatever you do,
 do not mention the word butterfly.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,118
 Why not?

246
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,719
 It's the word I used
 to hypnotise Nick and Hector.

247
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,719
 They might behave strangely.

248
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,719
 Stranger than usual?

249
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,358
 Yes.

250
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,359
 I think it worked.

251
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 So how do you dehypnotise them?

252
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,158
 There's a special word.

253
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,759
 What is it?

254
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 Dragonfly... Bee...

255
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,160
 No, wasp... Ant...

256
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,119
 Dragonfly, bee, wasp, ant...

257
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,039
 Nothing's happening!

258
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,278
 I'll be right there.

259
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,279
 Hurry!

260
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 -  What the...
 -  Hey, Victoria, come and rock!

261
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,878
 Where's Daisy?

262
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,478
 What's going on?

263
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,038
 The thing is,

264
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,358
 we were doing this magic trick and...

265
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,318
 We lost her.

266
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,319
 Nick, how could you?

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 That's it, I'm calling the police.

268
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,478
 Police.

269
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,479
 Daisy, darling!

270
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,398
 Wicked!

271
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,278
 She was in Princess Nicky's van.

272
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,718
 So, have you remembered the word?

273
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:34,719
 Yes. Caterpillar.

274
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,319
 What a mess!

275
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,839
 I'm not paying you.

276
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,839
 Well, then, you won't mind

277
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 that I've put parking tickets
 on four Mercedes,

278
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,119
 five Ferraris and two Porsches,
 illegally parked outside.

279
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:03,479
 Catherine parked outside

280
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,558
 and Jude did too.

281
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,559
 All of George's friends parked...

282
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
 Surely we can come
 to some kind of an arrangement.

283
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,039
 Very well.

284
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,278
 Well, I didn't meet George...

285
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,279
 It was a great party, though,
 and the money was good too.

286
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
 -  You'll need that for your fine.
 -  What fine?

287
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,118
 We had to tow your van away.

288
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,958
 I'm sorry, I didn't know it was yours.

289
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,959
 What?

290
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,999
 Come back!

291
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,278
 Next time in Extra...

292
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,238
 Annie is reading her crystal ball.

293
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,239
 Bridget wants to meet a handsome stranger.

294
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:18,439
 And what is scaring Hector and Nick?

295
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:18,759
 And what is scaring Hector and Nick?

1
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of Bridget
 and Annie, who share a flat in London

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
 and the boys next door - 
 Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Hector and Annie
 still love each other.

4
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,159
 Bridget still loves herself.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 And Nick loves babes,
 motorbikes and pizza.

6
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
 And I can see
 a great big bowl of dog food.

8
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,959
 And on the bowl, it says a name.

9
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,679
 It says...

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,479
 'Charley'!

11
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 It must be teatime, Charley.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,519
 Guess what!

13
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,039
 You've just met Brad Pitt.

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,039
 What? Don't be ridiculous, Annie.

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,238
 I've just been to see Rose Marie.

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,239
 -  Who's Rose Marie?
 -  My fortune teller.

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,880
 And she says I'm going to meet
 a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,478
 Oooh! When?

19
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,359
 She didn't say.

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
 -  Where?
 -  She didn't say.

21
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,758
 It must be true then.

22
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,759
 Maybe I'll meet him
 at tonight's Halloween party.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,918
 Have you read
 your horoscopes for today?

24
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,918
 -  No.
 -  Read mine.

25
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,919
 Aquarius, Libra, Leo...

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
 Ah, Taurus -  the Bull.

27
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,039
 'Taurus -  today,
 you will be in for a big surprise.'

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
 Ooh, goody.

29
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,919
 I'm getting a name...

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 It's...Nick.

31
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,279
 Gigi, you must be psychic.

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,959
 -  Sidekick?
 -  No.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
 Not 'sidekick', 'psychic'.
 A fortune- teller.

34
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,558
 Someone who can see the future.

35
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,879
 Ah, like Nostradamus?

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,839
 -  Who?
 -  Kind of.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,840
 Like horoscopes, or tarot.

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,439
 The tarot. The Death card.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 Look, it's Bridget with no make- up.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Like...
 having the palm of your hand read.

41
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,279
 Ah, rubbish! There's nothing there.

42
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,399
 What a surprise!

43
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,478
 Come here, give me your hand.

44
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,279
 I'll give you a lesson.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
 This one is your life line.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
 -  This one is your love line.
 -  Oh, yes?

47
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,359
 And this one is your...punch line!

48
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,278
 Punch line?

49
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,279
 She means it's the end of my lesson.

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,039
 Hey, Hector.

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,040
 What happens when you go
 to a fortune- teller's house?

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,520
 Come in!

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,399
 Ha ha!

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,439
 Let's see what your horoscope says.

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,478
 You don't believe all that rubbish?

56
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,479
 Rose Marie says Bridget is going to
 meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

57
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,998
 Hector...

58
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,999
 Bridget, this is my tall, dark,
 handsome stranger. Get your own!

59
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,359
 -  Who is Rose Marie?
 -  My fortune- teller.

60
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,919
 Is she good- looking?
 Could she find me a cute babe?

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 -  Do you want to hear your horoscope?
 -  Go on then. Aquarius.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 Aquarius, eh? I should've guessed.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,160
 'This week, beware of black hair

64
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 and the number three.'

65
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,759
 That means that three babes with
 black hair are going to chase me.

66
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,999
 -  Spooky!
 -  Can I be Aquarius?

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,440
 -  No!
 -  Come on, Hector, let's go out.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,640
 I'm going to meet
 some black- haired babes.

69
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,359
 Put that umbrella down - 
 it's very unlucky.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 But I'm feeling lucky.

71
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,399
 I wish I could meet
 a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

72
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,919
 Well, let me look into my crystal ball.

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 Annie, that's a goldfish bowl.

74
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,119
 So? I got it right for Charley.
 Didn't I, Charley?

75
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,399
 That could be my stranger now.

76
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,279
 Hello, Bernard.

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,758
 Hello, Bernard. How are you?

78
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,959
 Not happy, not happy at all.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,118
 I've lost my Marbles.

80
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,119
 Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,439
 What?

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,638
 You mean Marbles your cat?

83
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,639
 And she's not well - 
 she's got a cold.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,278
 Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find her.

85
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,638
 We'll look out for her, Bernard.

86
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,639
 I hope so. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,798
 Poor Bernard.

88
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,918
 He's lost his marbles.

89
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,919
 It had to happen.

90
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,479
 And on the bowl, it says a name.

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 It says...Charley!

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Hello, Bernard.

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

94
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,159
 You don't believe all that rubbish, do you?

95
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,318
 ..are going to chase me.

96
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,319
 Spooky!

97
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,960
 I'm feeling lucky!

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
 This is a true story about
 a man and wife on their honeymoon.

99
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,759
 They were in the car, it was late.

100
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,159
 The wife broke her mirror,
 which means seven years bad luck.

101
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,199
 Just then, they ran out of petrol.

102
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,679
 So, the man told the wife
 to go for petrol.

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,118
 He's the man, he should've gone.

104
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,119
 Equal opportunities.

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 The wife was gone for a long time.

106
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,679
 Then...

107
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,440
 He heard a noise
 on the roof of the car.

108
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,920
 It got louder.

109
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,759
 And then...

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,078
 his wife appeared.

111
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,079
 She smiled and walked away.

112
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 The noise was very loud.

113
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,399
 The man got out of his car
 and standing on the roof, he saw...

114
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
 a madman holding his wife's head!

115
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 So, the banging was...

116
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,639
 ..her head?

117
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,639
 But he'd just seen his wife.

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
 That...

119
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 was her ghost.

120
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,639
 Is that a true story?

121
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,718
 Yeah.

122
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,719
 -  Tell us another.
 -  No, don't.

123
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,878
 I mean, it was a bit dull, wasn't it?

124
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,319
 Come on,
 let's go shopping for the party.

125
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,238
 Yeah, I'm in the mood now.

126
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:05,239
 Are you coming, Nick?

127
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,640
 No. See you later.

128
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,199
 One, two...

129
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 -  Beware of black hair...
 -  Three apples.

130
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 ..and the number three.

131
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:29,319
 So what? There are three apples.

132
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 Big deal.

133
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
 Seven years of bad luck...

134
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
 What rubbish!

135
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,919
 I think I'll go back to my apartment now.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
 Black cat...black hair.

137
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
 Right, keep calm.

138
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 Nice pussy.

139
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 Who's there?

140
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,840
 Number...number three.

141
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,359
 Stop!

142
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,759
 Nick? Nick? Nick?

143
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,198
 He's coming round.

144
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,959
 What's going on?
 Why are you dressed like that?

145
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,359
 Nick, have you forgotten?

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,360
 It's Halloween.
 We're going to the party.

147
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,478
 Oh, yeah.

148
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,479
 I cannot get this knife
 into the pumpkin. Can you...?

149
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
 Yeah.

150
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
 Trick or treat?

151
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 Treat.

152
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,398
 There you are.

153
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,399
 Thank you.

154
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,278
 -  Aren't they sweet?
 -  Yeah.

155
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,279
 Sweet.

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 This is a true story about
 a man and wife on their honeymoon.

157
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,239
 I think I'll go back to my apartment now.

158
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,519
 One, two...three apples.

159
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,079
 Those witches were very cute.

160
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,399
 -  I think the small one fancied you.
 -  You think so?

161
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,119
 Boys, they weren't pretending.

162
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,478
 They really were witches.

163
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,479
 They were ugly enough.

164
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,718
 Hey, the lights have gone out.

165
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,038
 It must be the storm.

166
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,039
 A power cut!

167
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,759
 What was that?

168
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 Who was that?

169
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,199
 Bernard,
 what are you doing on the roof?

170
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 I still can't find my Marbles.

171
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,799
 -  Your marbles?
 -  His cat.

172
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 Bernard, I really don't think
 that you should be on the roof.

173
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,559
 Bernard, are you OK?

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,560
 Yeah, fine.
 I'll kill that cat when I find it.

175
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 I know, we'll light a candle.

176
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,760
 Well, there's no television,
 so I guess it's time for bed.

177
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
 Oh, no!

178
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 What's the matter, boys?
 Are you scared of the dark?

179
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,439
 No.

180
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 Well, if you're not scared
 of the dark, then let's play a game.

181
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,439
 -  A game?
 -  Let's get the ouija board out.

182
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,678
 B -  that's you, Bridget.

183
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,679
 Fan- ci- es...

184
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,798
 N -  that's you, Nick.

185
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,799
 Bridget fancies Nick!

186
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 Don't be so childish.
 Give that to me.

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 It's getting warm. I can feel...

188
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,359
 It's starting to move.

189
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,240
 H -  that's you, Hector.

190
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,599
 Depart. But I am not leaving.

191
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,599
 Depart.

192
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 'Dearly departed' means dead.

193
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,919
 That's it, I am leaving.

194
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,920
 Hector, sit down!

195
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 -  You are moving the glass, Bridget.
 -  No, I'm not.

196
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 N -  I think it's for you, Nick.

197
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 Oh, great, it'll be about babes.

198
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,598
 Three what?

199
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,599
 Didn't your horoscope say,
 'Beware of the number three?'

200
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,438
 Oh, yeah.

201
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,558
 You don't believe
 that rubbish, do you?

202
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,559
 Of course I do. Don't you?

203
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
 Well, the lights are back on.

204
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,599
 I'm tired.

205
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,318
 Why don't you depart then?

206
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,319
 Great idea.
 Come on, Hector, let's go.

207
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,598
 -  Hector?
 -  Eh?

208
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,198
 Do you believe in horoscopes?

209
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,438
 -  Of course not.
 -  No, of course not.

210
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,159
 They're silly.

211
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,959
 'Beware of black hair
 and the number three.'

212
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,879
 -  Rubbish!
 -  Yeah.

213
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 It could've meant, 'Beware of those
 three witches we met at the party.'

214
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,798
 Well, they did have black hair.

215
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,959
 Or those three trick or treaters.

216
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Trick or treat?

217
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,239
 Or the black cat.

218
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 -  What was that noise?
 -  Probably the wind.

219
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,519
 Yeah, the wind.

220
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,519
 -  Hector?
 -  Eh?

221
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,238
 Can I get into your bed?

222
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:59,239
 OK.

223
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,639
 -  I'm not afraid of the dark.
 -  Nor am I.

224
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,599
 I've only got one torch - 
 it's good to share.

225
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
 The storm's finished.

226
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,439
 What's that noise?

227
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 It's in the room.

228
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,039
 It's getting nearer.

229
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 -  Who's that?
 -  I don't know.

230
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 Nick, there is something
 touching my legs.

231
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
 -  Well, it's not me.
 -  I know.

232
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 But there is something
 touching my legs.

233
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 Bernard, did you hear that scream?

234
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,238
 What are you doing?

235
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,239
 I think Marbles is in there.

236
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,119
 Right, we're going in.

237
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 Hector, Nick? What's the matter?

238
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
 Marbles, there you are!

239
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,159
 How's your cold?

240
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,039
 Are you two OK?

241
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,159
 What's wrong?

242
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
 Has the cat got your tongue?

243
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,599
 Next time in Extra::

244
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
 Nick goes shopping.

245
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,159
 Hector tells Annie the truth.

246
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,519
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?

247
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,119
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?

248
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
 And why has Bridget got
 so many admirers?

1
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,279
 This is the story of Bridget
 and Annie, who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,439
 and the boys next door -  Nick, and
 his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,239
 Bridget wants to marry a millionaire.

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,119
 Nick wants to be a millionaire.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,839
 Hector is a millionaire.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,798
 But Annie doesn't really care.

7
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,799
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,160
 He's been gone for ages.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,358
 Do you think he did it?

10
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,359
 Nah. I bet he didn't dare.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
 Well, there you go.

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
 One bottle of milk...

13
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,239
 one tin of tuna...

14
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,078
 Bravo, Nick!

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,319
 Come on, Bridget, your turn.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
 Do your dare.

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,119
 Bernard, I love you!

18
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,359
 You're the one for me.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
 Please, let's run away together.

20
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,718
 All right, Bernard?

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,719
 Hello, Bernard. OK?

22
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,519
 Let's do it again.
 Tell the truth, or do a dare.

23
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,599
 Now, do you want to tell the truth?

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
 Well, then you have to do a dare.

25
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,959
 Yeah, but what dare?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,198
 I know.

27
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,199
 I dare you to...kiss Nick.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,958
 Truth or dare?

29
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,079
 A dare.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
 OK, I dare you to...

31
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,479
 copy someone in this room.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 Someone in this room, eh?

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
 Right, my turn.

34
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,039
 A dare.
 I dare myself to kiss Bridget.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
 Not another dare! Why not the truth?

36
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,038
 -  The truth?
 -  Yes.

37
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,559
 Nobody wants to speak the truth.

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 I dare you... I dare all of you
 to speak the truth.

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,278
 OK, let's speak the truth.

40
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,279
 -  For a whole day.
 -  Tomorrow.

41
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,879
 -  No lies?
 -  No lies.

42
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,838
 And the winner...

43
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,839
 we buy the winner dinner for two
 at The Ivy restaurant!

44
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,839
 24 hours of truth.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You will tell the truth, the whole
 truth and nothing but the truth.

46
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,998
 Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.

47
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,999
 Mr P is waiting for you
 at your usual table.

48
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,439
 The whole truth
 and nothing but the truth.

49
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 The truth.

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 -  What's wrong with you?
 -  Nothing at all really.

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 Is there no food in your apartment?

52
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,279
 The truth, the whole truth...

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 The thing is, Annie...
 The truth is...

54
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
 on Thursdays, I never go shopping,
 I just take your food.

55
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 What? You mean that...?

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,959
 Handy.

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,999
 Hello? What?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 An audition? A commercial? When?

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
 I've got to go.

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,959
 Hi, Nick.

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 Hi, Hector. What are you doing?

62
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,599
 I'm writing things
 I don't like about Annie.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,798
 What?

64
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,799
 Let's use the truth to make
 our relationship stronger.

65
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,319
 OK.

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 Go on, write
 things I don't like about Hector.

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
 OK. 'Things I don't like
 about Hector.'

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
 I behave like a big child?!

69
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,239
 I shout too much?

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
 See? You are doing it again.

71
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,679
 So, you don't like my carrot cake?

72
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 And you've never liked
 my carrot cake?

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,758
 -  No.
 -  But you always eat it.

74
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,519
 I didn't want to upset you.

75
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 Well, now I am cross. Very cross!

76
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,078
 See? You are shouting again.

77
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,839
 I do not shout too much!

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 Calm down, please, Annie.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I'm late, I'm late,
 I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,318
 Hello?

81
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,319
 John? No, I don't want to see you.
 Goodbye.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 An old boyfriend. How strange.

83
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,599
 So, Hector, if we're telling
 the truth, let me ask you...

84
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,878
 Yes?

85
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,879
 -  Do you fancy Bridget?
 -  No.

86
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 And before,
 have you ever fancied Bridget?

87
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,799
 Well...

88
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,039
 Out! Get out!

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But, Annie...

90
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 I hate the truth!

91
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 Annie, do I look fat
 in these trousers?

92
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,918
 Yes.

93
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,919
 To tell the truth, yes,
 you do look fat in those trousers.

94
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 I can't change clothes,
 I don't have time.

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 And don't forget -  one day of truth.

96
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,919
 You're the one for me.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Please, let's run away together.

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 I dare you... I dare all of you
 to speak the truth.

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,159
 Hello!

100
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 So, this is a commercial for yoghurt.

101
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,719
 That's right, Nick, Yupiyoghurts.

102
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,319
 Great!

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,919
 This is the most delicious yoghurt
 in the world.

104
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,398
 Wow, in the world.

105
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
 So, first, we want you to eat some.

106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 45 minutes late.

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,878
 I'm sorry, Eunice.

108
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,879
 What happened this time?
 A fire in the house?

109
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,439
 A burglar? A big monster?

110
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,719
 No. The bus...

111
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,919
 Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.

112
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 Mr P is waiting for you
 at your usual table.

113
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,879
 No. I'm late because I overslept.

114
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
 So, you overslept?

115
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,239
 Of course.
 You do need your beauty sleep.

116
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 Now, work!

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
 My bag. Where is it?

118
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,879
 Bridget, you know
 Channel 9 wants new talent?

119
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,599
 Have you found any?

120
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 Well, I have.

121
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,638
 A new presenter.

122
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,839
 Really? Who?

123
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 Me!

124
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
 Look.

125
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,319
 Hello, my darlings.

126
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,359
 What? What?

127
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
 Hello, my darlings.
 This is the beautiful Eunice,

128
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,519
 bringing you delight and wonder
 from Nannel Chine.

129
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,959
 From Channel 9.

130
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,959
 Stay tuned
 for all my special reports.

131
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 Well, what do you think?

132
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,479
 We want you to eat some
 and then say, 'Mm, delicious!'

133
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,879
 Mm, delicious.

134
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,078
 -  After I eat this?
 -  Yes.

135
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
 -  Do you have a problem with that?
 -  No. No problem at all.

136
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,439
 The truth.

137
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
 It's de...sgusting!

138
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,239
 It's terrible, it's horrible.

139
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,158
 -  Do I get the part?
 -  Next!

140
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,279
 Ridiculous?

141
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
 Ridiculous?!

142
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,119
 What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?

143
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,358
 Stupid yoghurt!

144
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,759
 So, you didn't get it then?

145
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
 -  Nah.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

146
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,799
 Well, at least I don't have
 to eat them again.

147
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,759
 Where's Hector?

148
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 Hector?

149
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,119
 Don't talk to me about Hector.

150
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,399
 So, where is she?

151
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,759
 -  Where is who?
 -  Bridget.

152
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 I got her message and here I am.

153
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,159
 -  You have got a date with Bridget.
 -  That's right.

154
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 This is a very, very strange day.

155
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,039
 Bridget's not in.

156
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 -  Here, have a yoghurt.
 -  Thanks.

157
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,960
 Handbag, handbag, handbag.

158
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 Eunice is an ugly,
 bad- tempered witch.

159
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
 My handbag.

160
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,559
 Oh, it's you.

161
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,479
 Hello?

162
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 Who? Kevin?

163
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,639
 Three years ago Kevin?

164
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 No, no, I don't!

165
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 Two old boyfriends - 
 first John, now Kevin.

166
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
 What a coincidence.

167
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,759
 Mm, delicious.

168
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 Mm, it's de...sgusting!

169
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,718
 Do I look fat in these trousers?

170
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,719
 Yes.

171
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
 What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?

172
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,759
 Kevin?

173
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 What a coincidence.

174
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 Hello, Bridget.

175
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,199
 How dare you call me a witch?

176
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,479
 'You are an ugly
 bad- tempered witch.'

177
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
 -  I didn't send that message.
 -  No? It's your number.

178
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
 My mobile, someone took my mobile.

179
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,519
 Good try.

180
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:14,199
 The truth. Did you send that message?

181
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,079
 No, no! Someone took my phone.

182
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 All right then,
 you didn't send the message.

183
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,399
 So, what do you think of me?

184
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 The truth?

185
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,120
 The truth, Eunice -  you're an ugly,
 bad- tempered witch.

186
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 You know, Bridget,
 honesty is a great quality.

187
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,678
 -  It is?
 -  It is.

188
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,679
 I hope honesty will help you...

189
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,919
 when you look for a new job!
 You're fired!

190
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,959
 Well, hooray for the truth.

191
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 Ziggy's coming later.
 Then we'll decide who's the winner.

192
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,598
 What a day!

193
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,318
 I need comfort food.

194
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,319
 The truth...the truth is,
 we were asking the wrong questions.

195
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,478
 Ask me what I think of your eyes.

196
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,479
 What do you think of my eyes?

197
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 I think you have the most beautiful
 eyes I have ever seen in my life.

198
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
 Really? Tell me more.

199
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
 I think you are
 the sweetest, kindest...

200
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 -  Oh, snuggly puppy!
 -  Oh, sugar plum!

201
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,359
 I feel sick.

202
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,319
 Hello?

203
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,479
 Oh, not again!

204
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Listen, Stuart, I finished with you
 because you have no personality,

205
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 no money...and no sense of humour.

206
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,559
 More old boyfriends.

207
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,239
 I don't understand it.

208
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,279
 At last.

209
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,880
 Oh, Bridget my fair

210
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,319
 -  Oh, Bridget my fair...
 -  Stop, stop.

211
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,039
 Stop!

212
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 Why are you doing this?

213
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,959
 -  But you told me to come.
 -  I told you to come?

214
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,518
 I got your text.

215
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,519
 Who is sending
 all these messages from my mobile?

216
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,399
 John? No, I don't want
 to see you! Goodbye.

217
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So, where is she.
 I got her message and here I am.

218
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
 ..call me a witch? You're fired!

219
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
 My bag? Handbag, handbag?

220
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,239
 Eunice is an ugly bad- tempered witch!

221
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,479
 Oh, it's you.

222
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,679
 It was you, wasn't it?

223
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,159
 I think Bridget should be the winner.

224
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 Yes, we'll pay for dinner for two
 at the Ivy.

225
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 Yes! I'm going to the Ivy!

226
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,878
 Eunice?

227
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,518
 So, what do you want?

228
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,519
 'Please come to my flat at 7pm.'

229
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,558
 Now, what do you want?

230
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,559
 I didn't text you. Ziggy stole
 my phone and sent those messages.

231
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,719
 Oh, lady of such beauty

232
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 -  I have never seen...
 -  Who's this?

233
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,479
 Lady of such beauty
 You shall be my queen

234
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:53,439
 Bridget, where did you find this man?

235
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,958
 He is perfect for Channel 9.

236
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,839
 He is?

237
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 Absolutely.
 He'll make a perfect weather man.

238
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,319
 Maybe you can have your job back.

239
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
 Now, come and talk
 about your contract.

240
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,799
 Weird.

241
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,839
 Oh, Bridget

242
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
 She's a natural blonde

243
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:34,479
 Her bottom is big

244
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 And she wears a thong

245
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 So, do I get a job too?

246
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,118
 Next time in Extra - 

247
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,278
 Nick becomes a pilot,

248
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,158
 Hector is his hostess

249
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,158
 and why has Eunice come to stay?

250
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,158
 and why has Eunice come to stay?

1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,238
 This is the story
 ofBridget andAnnie,

2
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,279
 who share a flat in London,

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door -  Nick,
 and his friend Hector from Argentina.

4
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,559
 Bridget and Hector
 work for Channel 9.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,879
 Annie works for the environment

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,880
 and Nick works as little as possible.

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,399
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,999
 One for the party
 and one for the party hostess.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 One for the party
 and one for the party...

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 accountant.

11
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,599
 Hey, it's Builder Barbie!

12
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,319
 Very funny.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,478
 Eunice wants some building work done

14
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,119
 and guess who has to organise it.

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 Builder Barbie?

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 Hey, not for you, for the party.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 We're having a party?
 What shall I wear?

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,919
 It's a street party.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 We're having a party in the street
 to protest and stop the cars.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
 Nice!

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,760
 Hey, what's this?

22
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:07,279
 Don't touch it.
 It belonged to my grandmother.

23
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,198
 Your grandmother? It's lovely.

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,199
 Yes. It's very special to me.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 Well, what do you think?

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 Captain Chip Hardy,
 Pilot Extraordinaire.

27
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,199
 Nick, is that you?

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,279
 It can't be.

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
 Women love uniforms.

30
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,839
 Hey, hey,
 Builder Barbie and Pilot Ken!

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 But why are you dressed like a pilot?

32
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,639
 I am in a play - 

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire - 

34
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,279
 for a theatre festival in Paris.

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,840
 Now, who is going
 to help me rehearse?

36
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 Sorry, got to go.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,880
 Come on, you know you want to.

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
 -  Come fly with me.
 -  What?

39
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,399
 Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
 about you all the time.

40
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,439
 -  Nick, I really think...
 -  Don't tell me, I feel it too - 

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,639
 something's not quite right.

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,158
 I have got it.

43
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,159
 Here. There. Beautiful.
 Now, I can fancy you.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,160
 Oh, no, Nick, please.

45
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:02,158
 Did you miss me, sweet thing?

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,159
 Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
 about you all the time.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
 When we get to Barbados...

48
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,958
 Sorry.

49
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,959
 But now, we have work to do.

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is
 your captain Chip Hardy speaking.

51
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,519
 We will now go through
 the safety routine.

52
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,519
 Exits are here, here and here.

53
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,078
 In the event of cabin decompression,

54
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,079
 place oxygen masks
 over your face, like so.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 But please, attend to your own mask
 before helping children.

56
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,079
 Life jackets can be found
 under your seat.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 In case of forced landing,
 adopt the following position.

58
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,518
 Eunice,

59
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,519
 -  I've got the builders on the phone.
 -  About time.

60
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
 Hello. You can start today?

61
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,519
 Oh, Jean- Pierre,
 how nice to hear from you.

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,158
 We really need the job done quickly.

63
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,159
 We should meet tonight? Oh, yes.

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,439
 Ah, yes, where to start?

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 Where? Mm,
 that's a very good question.

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,320
 Where would you like
 the building work to start?

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 I was thinking...in my flat.

68
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,079
 -  In your flat?
 -  Oh, yes. In my flat.

69
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,199
 Hello? We want you
 to start work in Eunice's flat.

70
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,919
 Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 -  It's 31 Evergreen Street.
 -  It's 31 Evergreen Street.

72
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,599
 That's right. Bye.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 -  Tea? Coffee?
 -  No, no, no!

74
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,599
 Make it musical, feel the words.

75
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,799
 Tea! Or coffee!

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 Tea! Or coffee!

77
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,239
 Thanks.

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 Hey, Nick, do women really
 go for you in that uniform?

79
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,799
 Yeah.

80
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,399
 But do they know
 that you are not a real pilot?

81
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,719
 Well...

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
 You tell them you are a real pilot?

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Maybe.

84
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

85
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,758
 Oh, hi, Tiffany.

86
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,759
 I love this uniform!

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,038
 Yes, that's right, sweetie.

88
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,039
 Currently flying at 20,000 feet,
 heading for Barbados.

89
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,959
 Yes, that's right, darling,
 above the clouds, above the clouds.

90
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,839
 Mayday, mayday...

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,638
 No, no, no, we're just...

92
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,639
 We're not being attacked,
 it's just a bit of turbulence.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 Look, I've got to go. Bye- bye.

94
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,760
 -  Hi, Eunice.
 -  Guess where this came from.

95
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,119
 -  DIY shop?
 -  No. From my flat.

96
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,920
 Ah, yes. Have the builders started?
 Excellent.

97
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 Excellent? Excellent?!
 My flat is a mess.

98
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,199
 You told the builders
 to work in my flat?

99
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,239
 Yes, you said.

100
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 But the builders were supposed
 to work at Channel 9.

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,278
 Your mistake, you fix it.

102
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,279
 -  But you...
 -  And until you do,

103
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 I'm going to stay in your flat.

104
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 We want you to start work
 in Eunice's flat.

105
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

106
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
 Captain Chip Hardy,
 Pilot Extraordinaire.

107
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
 I want to ride the pony!

108
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,998
 Bridget, I want my breakfast now.

109
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 Of course.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,719
 -  What would you like?
 -  I want...

111
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 fresh coconut milk,
 two rashers of crisp bacon,

112
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
 preserve of morello cherries - 
 on French toast - 

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 and coffee -  Italian coffee.

114
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,038
 Fresh coconut milk, Italian coffee?

115
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 -  I don't have...
 -  So, go out and buy them for me.

116
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,159
 Horrible!

117
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,879
 Captain Hardy,
 what are we going to do?

118
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,119
 It will be OK.

119
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,079
 I am too young to die.

120
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,319
 -  You have to save us.
 -  Try to be calm.

121
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,999
 But what about my family?
 What about my cat?

122
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 Pull yourself together, woman.

123
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 Excellent! You're really good.
 That was like...

124
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,759
 Catherine Zeta- Jones.

125
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,918
 You didn't have to slap me for real.

126
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,919
 Sorry, but I...

127
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,759
 Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

128
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,918
 What?

129
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,919
 It's the director.

130
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 What? What?!

131
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,319
 Just a minute.

132
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,998
 The actress? She's ill?

133
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,439
 But we must still do the play.

134
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 No, we don't have much time.

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 Don't worry, I know the perfect
 person to play the part.

136
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,639
 Oh, yes, the perfect person. Bye.

137
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,759
 I...have an extra ticket for Paris.

138
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,558
 -  Do you want to come with me?
 -  Paris?

139
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,559
 -  Oui, oui.
 -  Excellente!

140
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,679
 You call this a breakfast?

141
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,280
 That's what I think of this.

142
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,399
 And this.

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 And this.

144
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,639
 And I have a little washing for you.

145
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,239
 In the bedroom.

146
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 Now, what shall I eat?

147
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
 You call this, 'a little washing?'

148
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,999
 Be quiet and do it.

149
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
 Hi. I got some polish
 for Granny's chest.

150
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,198
 -  Nice.
 -  Oh, I love it so much.

151
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,199
 It really reminds me of her.

152
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,799
 Hey, you're eating my party food.

153
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,199
 Yes, but...

154
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 it's not very good.
 Here, Charley boy!

155
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 Annie, Annie, please.

156
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 I don't want to lose my job.
 It's only for a few days.

157
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,959
 Now, which of you lucky girls
 is going to cut my toenails?

158
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,879
 I'm going to kill that woman!

159
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,278
 No, no, let me.

160
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,279
 Are you having fun with Eunice?

161
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,319
 Why don't you stay here
 while we are away?

162
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,039
 No, thank you.

163
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
 Good luck in Paris.

164
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 Oh, Paris, c'est magnifique!

165
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 Hector, where were you?
 Our play starts soon.

166
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:15,479
 OK, good luck.

167
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,599
 Hector, there's something
 I've got to tell you.

168
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,519
 Your play, it starts very soon.

169
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,399
 Where is the actress
 who plays the stewardess?

170
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 Well, actually she's right here.

171
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,439
 Good joke.

172
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,238
 The actress, she's ill.

173
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,959
 You are going to play the stewardess.

174
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,838
 Look, there's your costume.

175
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,718
 You are not serious?

176
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,598
 You are serious.

177
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,599
 Listen, Sylvia,
 I am going to fly this plane,

178
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
 I will need all my crew.
 You are a professional.

179
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,759
 I am your captain.

180
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 Will you fly with me?

181
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,239
 No, no. No, no, no.

182
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 I am not doing it.

183
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 Sylvia, I'm proud of you.

184
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,679
 Oh, shut up.

185
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 What's that?

186
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,599
 -  Come and have something to eat.
 -  The shape looks familiar.

187
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
 You've guessed.

188
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,878
 It is that chest.

189
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,879
 I did some work on it for you.

190
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,039
 It looked so boring.
 I gave it a whole new look.

191
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 My grandmother's chest!

192
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,679
 Annie, Annie, please.

193
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 Annie, Annie, please.

194
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:54,199
 Where is the actress
 who plays the stewardess?

195
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
 Well, she's ill.

196
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,438
 You are going to play the stewardess.

197
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:06,439
 Oh, shut up.

198
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,118
 That was close!
 We nearly missed the plane.

199
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,118
 Look at the reviews.

200
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,119
 'Irresistible.'

201
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,879
 'Dazzling.'

202
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 And that was just her legs.

203
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,479
 'The hostess was beautiful...

204
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,199
 in a masculine way.'

205
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,479
 What's going on?

206
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 we're experiencing some turbulence.

207
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 There's nothing to worry about except
 that the pilot and co- pilot are ill.

208
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,679
 Does anybody know how to fly a plane?

209
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,079
 Don't worry, I will fly this plane.

210
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Nick, you cannot fly this plane.

211
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
 I am Captain Chip Hardy.

212
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,359
 I can do anything.

213
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,518
 You are just an actor.

214
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,519
 Captain Chip Hardy is your character.

215
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,279
 But I have the heart of a pilot.

216
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 Tea? Coffee?

217
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,759
 Wait a minute.

218
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
 Hello?

219
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,559
 Oh, really? Oh, excellent!

220
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,158
 Goodbye.

221
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,318
 Who was that?

222
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,319
 The builders.
 Eunice's flat is finished!

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,519
 Really?

224
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 Her flat is ready!

225
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,279
 Our flat is ours again!

226
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
 Hello, girls.
 Have you had a nice time?

227
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,758
 What happened here?

228
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,759
 Just a little party.

229
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,559
 It was really fun.

230
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,678
 OK, Eunice,

231
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,719
 we've spoken to the builders.

232
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,879
 Your flat's ready.

233
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 You can go home now.

234
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,319
 I like it here.

235
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,639
 I think I'm going to stay.

236
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 Where's my cocktail?

237
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,879
 Bring my new wig.

238
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 -  What do you mean?
 -  What do I mean?

239
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,640
 I am going to stay.

240
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,118
 We are back!

241
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,719
 Paris was great and...

242
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 Pilot Ken and Stewardess Barbie.

243
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,959
 But he really is a pilot - 
 he flew the plane!

244
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
 Well, for a moment.
 Till the co- pilot punched me.

245
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
 What happened here? A hurricane?

246
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 Yes, something like that.

247
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 Well, Nick, what's this? A new job?

248
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,919
 Yes, sort of.

249
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 So, Mr Pilot, shall we have some fun?

250
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,598
 Yeah, OK.

251
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,599
 Will you take me flying?

252
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,359
 OK.

253
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,398
 Shall we stay here or go to my place?

254
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,399
 Let's go to your place.
 This place is a mess!

255
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 Really, girls,
 you should tidy up a bit.

256
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 It is the uniform.

257
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,639
 At last, she's gone!

258
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,518
 I'm exhausted.

259
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,519
 Well, if you are tired, can I
 offer you some tea or coffee?

260
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,998
 Next time in Extra - 

261
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,958
 Bridget is interested in modern art,

262
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,959
 Annie is fighting
 to free farm animals,

263
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,638
 and who else is coming to dinner?

264
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:17,638
 andwho else is coming to dinner?

1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,599
 They have a neighbour, Nick.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,358
 Nick fancies Bridget.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,359
 But Annie fancies Nick.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 That's the way it is
 until Bridget gets a letter from Argentina.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,679
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Is he stupid?

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 I told you...

9
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,919
 Sorry. B.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
 Yes, John?

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 Yes, I got the cards
 and the flowers and the chocolates.

12
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,799
 Yes. And I got the cushion as well.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,038
 But it's finished. Sorry.

14
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,959
 But please don't leave me.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,399
 -  Don't cry.
 -  I love you so much.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,238
 Goodbye.

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
 Oh, and happy birthday.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 Ah, men!

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 Come on, Charley. Come on.

20
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 Post, Bridget. Charley and I have the post,
 haven't we, Charley?

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,439
 Give me the post, Charley.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 Give me the post, Charley.

23
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,919
 Drop it, Charley.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 Oh, good boy!

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 What's this?

27
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,959
 A parcel for you, Bridget.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 Good. What is it?

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 Oh, it's from Mother.

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,919
 'Bridget darling, this arrived for you
 and I made you this.

31
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,399
 'Love, Mummy.'

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
 Oh, very you, Bridget.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,878
 Mother!

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,879
 Ooh, this is from Argentina.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,558
 Argentina? Who from? What does it say?

36
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,559
 Erm, it says, 'Hello, do you remember me?'

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
 No.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 'Seven years ago we was penpals.

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
 'We was...' We were penpals.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
 Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's Hector.

41
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,078
 Who's Hector?

42
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
 He was my penpal seven years ago.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
 Oh.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,598
 'I speak English good now...'

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,599
 I speak English good.
 I speak English well now...

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,278
 '..and I am coming to England.'

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,279
 Ooh, Latin Americans!

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 'I would like to sleep with you.'

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
 'Do you have a bed for me?'

50
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,039
 Oh, he wants to stay here.

51
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,919
 But, erm, what about the rules?

52
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,919
 Ooh, a Latin American here.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,919
 Ooh, like Ricky Martin!

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
 -  Tall, handsome...
 -  Rich.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
 So, erm, when is he coming?

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 Oh, erm, let me see. It says...November 5th.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 Oh, November 5th. But that's...

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 Today!

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,798
 Oh, it's you, Nick.

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,558
 Hi, babes!

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,559
 -  Hello, Nick. How are you?
 -  Great.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,758
 Nice muscles.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,759
 -  Here's your milk.
 -  Our milk?

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 You mean our milk
 you borrowed three weeks ago.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,319
 Oh, thanks, Nick.

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 I forget nothing!

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,119
 Would you like a drink, Nick?

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,319
 -  Uh- huh?
 -  I said, 'Would you like a drink, Nick?'

70
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,359
 Oh! Sorry.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 No, thanks.

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, erm, Bridget's friend is coming.

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 -  Oh, yeah?
 -  Uh- huh. From Argentina.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,799
 Wow! From Argentina!

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,039
 -  What's she like?
 -  She is a he.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 -  Huh?
 -  Not a girl, a boy.

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
 Tough guy, eh?

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Why don't I show you how to do it properly?

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
 Nick, I've told you before,
 nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

80
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,359
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 If you touch my bike again, you are out.
 O- U- T, out. Clear?

82
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,239
 What?

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
 I said...

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,878
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,358
 You mean, 'I am called Hector.'

87
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,398
 You are called Hector?

88
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,078
 Oh, no, no, no. I am called Annie.

89
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,638
 I am called Annie.

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,639
 No. She means, 'I am called Hector.
 I am from Argentina.'

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
 You are from Argentina?

92
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
 Come in.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Hello.

94
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,079
 -  Hi, babes!
 -  Hello, Nick.

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
 I forget nothing.

96
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
 Nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 -  Well, why not?
 -  Why not?

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
 I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 My cars.

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,919
 You play with cars?

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
 Yes. You play...no.

102
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,359
 I play with cars.

103
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,638
 He plays with cars.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,639
 I read. I love the library.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,999
 Fascinating.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We go to the library too, don't we, Bridget?

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
 Yes, it's great.

108
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,759
 Good.

109
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,799
 I live here.

110
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
 You live in a museum, full of old things?

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 Old things? Yes, I have lots of old things.

112
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,439
 I live in a museum.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
 OK, I live in a museum.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Well, thank you, Hector.
 And now we'll show you the flat.

115
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
 This is the bedroom.

116
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,759
 Thank you.

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,119
 Who- hey!

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,479
 Where do you sleep?

119
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 Er, no, you don't understand.
 We only have one bedroom.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
 One? I have 20.

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,518
 20?

122
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
 Yes, he lives in a museum, with 20 bedrooms.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Oh! Very funny, 20 bedrooms.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 Well, you can sleep here.

125
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,799
 Oh, thank you.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 -  Oh, no, no, no, Hector.
 -  Uh?

127
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
 It's a bed.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,638
 A bed? Oh, wow...

129
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,598
 Oh...

130
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,358
 -  Here's a cushion.
 -  Oh, thank you.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,359
 Oh, this of course is the TV.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 But just relax. I must go to the bathroom.

133
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,119
 Psst! Annie! Bathroom!

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 Now!

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,159
 Oh, my goodness. What are we going to do?

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,278
 He plays with toy cars.

137
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
 He is not a sexy Argentinian.

138
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,478
 But he is sweet.

139
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,479
 And he is polite.

140
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,198
 But those clothes!

141
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,199
 He is so old- fashioned.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 He must go.

143
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,239
 Room service.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,199
 Hello. Who are you?

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 -  Oh. You are quick. Good.
 -  Eh?

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 -  My luggage is downstairs.
 -  What?

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,199
 -  Bring it up, please.
 -  What are you doing?

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,879
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

149
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,758
 The butler?

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,759
 I am Nick. I live next door.

151
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,598
 I am Hector.

152
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,599
 Oh, Hector, from Argentina.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Yes, from Argentina.

154
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,079
 Where are the girls?

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,679
 -  The girls?
 -  Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,399
 Oh, they live here.

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Yeah, I know. Where's Bridget?
 Does she know you are here?

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 Bridget, she gave me this.

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 Hello, Nick. Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,638
 Yeah, I know.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,438
 -  Isn't he wonderful?
 -  Wonderful.

162
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,918
 -  Are you hungry?
 -  Uh?

163
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,919
 We'll buy your lunch.
 What would you like to eat?

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 -  Fish and chips?
 -  Oh, fish and ships!

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 Erm, Nick, Hector, make friends?

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 Nick, teach Hector some English.

167
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,638
 Yeah, OK.

168
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 I'll teach Hector some English.

169
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,359
 Oh, you are quick. Good.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

171
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,999
 The butler?

172
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 She gave me this.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 I'll teach Hector some English.

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 OK...this is the oven.

175
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,198
 This is the oven.

176
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

177
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So you say, 'Annie, the dog is in the oven.'

179
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
 Annie, the dog is in the oven.

180
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,718
 Great! Now Bridget.

181
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,719
 -  Oh. Oh, dear.
 -  Huh?

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Well, Bridget likes strong men,
 especially strong legs.

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,318
 I am strong.

184
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,319
 Yeah? Can you cycle 50 kilometres?

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,078
 -  Yes.
 -  No way.

186
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,798
 -  Yes.
 -  Well, go on, then, show me.

187
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,799
 Yes, look.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 Adios, amigo.

189
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
 Ah. Bridget, Annie, lunch.

190
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,678
 Fish and chips.

191
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,679
 Yes, lunch, Hector.

192
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
 Look, Bridget, 50 kilometres.

193
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 What?

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,359
 Hi. Everything OK?

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 Great!

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I am... How do you say? Erm...

198
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,039
 -  Dead.
 -  Hot.

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,999
 Hot. Yeah, I am hot. I need a...

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 -  Shower.
 -  Yeah, I need a shower.

201
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,119
 -  Be my guest.
 -  Oh, thank you.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,519
 Right, that's it. He must go.

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,238
 Why? He is so nice.

204
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,759
 He used my bike.

205
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
 Yeah, and he said that the dog was in the oven.
 What a horrible joke.

206
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Where is Charley? Charley!

207
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 -  What a bad, bad boy.
 -  He must go.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 -  Can he stay with you, Nick?
 -  Uh- uh. Sorry, ladies.

209
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 -  Oh, please, Nick. You have a spare room.
 -  No way. Not my problem.

210
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,039
 -  He must go now.
 -  But he's in the shower.

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 I don't care.

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
 Hector, please come out,
 we want to talk to you.

213
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 I like fish and chips, I...

214
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,998
 Hector, please come out, we want to talk to you.

215
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,358
 OK, one moment, please.

216
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,198
 I like fish and chips...

217
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,199
 Yes, you want me?

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 -  We think...
 -  We...

219
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 We...we have a problem.

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
 It's like this.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 Go on, then, tell him.

222
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,518
 Yes, Bridget?

223
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,519
 Hector, the thing is...

224
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,199
 Stay there. I'll talk to him.

225
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,239
 Hector, can I have a word, please?

226
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Ricky Martin!

227
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Hector, is this you?

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 Yes, and my parents.

229
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 'The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.'

230
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,639
 Who are these?

231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 My...

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 -  Servants.
 -  Yeah, my servants.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
 -  Your cars?
 -  Yeah, my cars.

234
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 Hector, you are rich.

235
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,238
 Why stay here?

236
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 I want friends. Good friends.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 People like you for your money?

238
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
 That's awful.

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Erm... Listen, keep it a secret.

240
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,359
 -  OK.
 -  OK.

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 Perhaps he could stay here.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 Yes. Poor boy.

243
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,439
 Hector, come and stay with me.
 I have two rooms.

244
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 -  Shut up, Nick.
 -  Hector will stay with us, won't you, Hector?

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Hector, come and...sit down.

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hector, please, call me Gigi.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
 Oh, Charley, there you are.

248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

249
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
 The oven?

250
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 Yes. Nick is a good English teacher.

251
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,239
 Yes, a very good English teacher.

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 -  I'd love to see your photos again.
 -  Oh, me too.

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Oh, your sweet toy cars!

254
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,718
 They are not toys.

255
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,719
 Today Hector arrives and it's Bonfire Night.

256
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,118
 Let's party!

257
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,119
 -  What sort of music do you like?
 -  Music?

258
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,399
 Yeah, music. You know, soul, funk, dance.

259
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 Watch me. Like this.

260
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
 Interesting.

261
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,759
 I dance...like this.

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 I'll get it. I'll get it.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,318
 Hello.

264
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,319
 Oh, yeah, that's great.

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 Sure. Come up.

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,398
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  The tarantula!

267
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,399
 -  Quick, hide, Hector.
 -  I'm off. I owe two weeks' rent.

268
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,398
 Next time in Extra...

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,238
 The flatmates go shopping for Hector.

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,238
 Hector goes shopping for the girls.

271
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,239
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

272
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,199
 But what happens
 when Hector goes shopping for himself?

1
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,078
 They have a neighbour, Nick,

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,198
 who likes Bridget.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,919
 But Annie likes Nick.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 That is until Hector arrives from Argentina,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
 and Hector is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,639
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 Oh. Argentinian.

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,239
 Maybe...

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,839
 Hector, please,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 call me Gigi.

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 'Oh, Hector, call me Gigi.'

13
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,439
 -  A.
 -  Is Hector still asleep?

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Yep.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
 Hector, wakey- wakey.

16
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,799
 Come on. Rise and shine.

17
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 Sweet.

18
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,758
 Good morning.

19
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,198
 Oh, good morning.

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,838
 No, no, no. Good morning.

21
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,878
 -  Ah- ah- ah.
 -  Oh.

22
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,559
 Good morning.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,438
 Ah- ah- ah.

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,119
 No, Hector.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,078
 -  I have a cold.
 -  And so have I.

26
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,318
 Oh, you have a cold, Bridget.

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
 Yes, I have a cold.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
 Yes. We have a cold.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,919
 So let's begin again.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,678
 Good morning.

31
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,918
 Good morning.

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,159
 Oh, never mind.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 Hector, would you like some...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 new pyjamas?

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 Hector, please excuse me for a moment.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 Pssst. Annie. Bathroom.

37
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,679
 Now.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 -  Good morning.
 -  Good morning.

39
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,839
 Is it fancy dress?

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,878
 Fancy dress?

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,318
 Yes.

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,519
 Oh. Nice.

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,158
 Hey.

44
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,199
 Nice car, eh?

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,679
 I have this car at home.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 Wow. You have this car at home?

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,079
 Girls must love you.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,038
 Girls?

49
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,039
 -  No.
 -  No?

50
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,719
 Hector, can I tell you something?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,679
 OK.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 The car looks good.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,878
 Yeah?

54
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,879
 So you must look good too.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,798
 -  I look good.
 -  No.

56
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
 You don't look good.

57
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,879
 But I can help.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,398
 OK.

59
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
 OK.

60
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,679
 Yes.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 -  Hector's clothes are awful.
 -  They're so old- fashioned.

62
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,519
 I know. I'll take him shopping.

63
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,559
 But, Bridget, you are so busy.
 I'll take him shopping.

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,359
 -  No, it's all right, I'll take him shopping.
 -  It's no problem, I'll take him.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 I said I'll take him shopping!

66
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,959
 You need...

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,638
 You need a...

68
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
 Well, hi, babe.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,118
 -  Oh, it's you, Nick.
 -  Oh, hi, Nick.

70
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,119
 Hector has asked me what clothes to wear.

71
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,839
 Yeah, right.

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 You need a look

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
 like on a fast bike.

74
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,198
 No, no, no, Hector, don't listen to Nick.

75
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,118
 -  Listen to me.
 -  OK.

76
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,119
 You need a designer look.

77
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,959
 No, no, no, Hector, that's not for you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,398
 You need,

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,399
 you need...a cowboy look.

80
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,919
 -  No, no. A leather jacket.
 -  A bandanna and a vest.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,918
 A denim shirt.

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,158
 -  A motorbike.
 -  Designer.

83
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,478
 Cowboy.

84
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,919
 Stop.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
 OK.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,598
 I will go shopping.

87
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,798
 -  What?
 -  On your own?

88
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,799
 But...you need us.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,678
 How? What will you say?

90
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,238
 Er...

91
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,679
 It's OK. Leave it to me.

92
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 I am the shopkeeper, you are the customer.

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,158
 -  Uh?
 -  This is a shop.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,159
 -  I sell, you buy.
 -  Oh, OK.

95
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,519
 Ding- dong.

96
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,239
 Good morning.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,038
 Good morning.

98
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,079
 Can I help you?

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 Yes. I...

100
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,198
 I would like...

101
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,199
 Oh. I would like...

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
 a jacket, please.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,199
 Trousers.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,158
 I would like a pair of trousers, please.

105
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,159
 Oh, I would like a pair of trousers, please.

106
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,038
 And...

107
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,438
 a shirt.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,998
 No.

109
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,558
 Shoes.

110
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,559
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

111
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,759
 I would like a pair of shoes, please.

112
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,719
 And a cat for my head.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I think you mean a hat.

114
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,159
 This is a cat.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,078
 A cat? A cat for my head.

116
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,079
 A cat for my head!

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,119
 Hector. Come shopping with me.

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,519
 -  Or me.
 -  No, me.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 -  He's my pen friend.
 -  All right.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,239
 I will go to the shoe shop.

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,438
 And I will go to the clothes shop.

123
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,038
 No, I'll go to the clothes shop.

124
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,039
 OK. I'll just buy the shirt.

125
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,118
 I'll buy the trousers.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,118
 Good.

127
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,318
 Good.

128
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,319
 Right. Let's go.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,680
 Oh, no. I completely forgot.

130
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
 We need eggs, lemons and dog food.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
 Oh, it's all right. I'll do it online later.

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 Oh, well done, Hector.

134
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,119
 Bye, Hector. Oh, and don't answer the phone.
 It might be the tarantula.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,918
 OK.

136
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,758
 Bye, Hector. Be good.

137
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,198
 And if you can't be good, be careful.

138
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,199
 -  Huh?
 -  Never mind.

139
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,599
 ..new pyjamas.

140
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,039
 I'll take him shopping.

141
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,199
 Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
 a little bit each.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 You need a cowboy look.

143
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,279
 You need a look like on a fast bike.

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
 Good morning, sir.

145
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,958
 I would like...

146
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,959
 a cat for my head!

147
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,199
 A cat...

148
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Oh. Room service.

149
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,239
 Hello. I would like an egg for my head.

150
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,359
 Lemons for my head!

151
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,279
 -  Dog food for my head!
 -  Who's that?

152
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,999
 The tarantula!

153
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,559
 I said, 'Who's that?'

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,278
 -  Hello?
 -  Where's Bridget?

155
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,279
 Er... Where is Bridget?

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
 Me.

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,919
 I am Bridget.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,759
 I don't believe you.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Yes, I have a cold.

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,399
 -  Atchoo! Atchoo!
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Oh, thank you. Atchoo!

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,479
 Charley!

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,679
 Is that a dog?

164
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 No, no, it's not a dog, it's a...

165
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,239
 Annie. Yes.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Annie has a cold also.

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,598
 Oh, poor Annie.

168
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,039
 Thank you. Atchoo. Now goodbye.

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 Atchoo! Atchoo!

170
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,278
 Ole.

171
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,039
 I am Hector.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,919
 I speak English.

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.

174
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,119
 'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

175
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,518
 Oh, hi. Good afternoon, Annie.

176
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,359
 Good afternoon, Hector.

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,078
 I bought this for you.

178
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,478
 What is it?

179
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,159
 Try it on.

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,758
 Try...

181
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,918
 it...

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,278
 on.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,599
 Try...

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
 it...

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,718
 on.

186
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,719
 Oh. Try it on.

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,559
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In the bathroom.

188
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,558
 Good. I'll give this to him.

189
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 -  It's OK, I'll give it to him.
 -  No, it's all right.

190
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
 Hector.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,359
 Hector.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 I've got something for you.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,758
 Oh. OK.

194
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,759
 Come in.

195
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
 Spoilsport.

196
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Hector?

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,998
 Hector?

198
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,999
 -  Hello?
 -  Here are your clothes.

199
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,638
 You will look so cool.

200
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
 -  Cool?
 -  Cool.

201
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,039
 Cool.

202
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,479
 Nice melons.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,079
 Melons? Who are those from?

204
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 I think Hector has been shopping online.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 I'm really thirsty. I need a drink.

206
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
 -  But we don't need any melons.
 -  Well, he did try.

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,478
 And he bought some eggs.

208
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,318
 Yeah.

209
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,319
 Just a few.

210
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,239
 Nice melons.

211
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 Just a few.

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Thank you.

213
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,398
 Try...

214
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,439
 it...

215
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 on.

216
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
 I've got something for you.

217
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,839
 So how did Hector do the shopping?

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 Hector ordered ten melons
 instead of ten lemons.

219
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,679
 Oh, an easy mistake. He did try.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,319
 Yes, he did try.

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,039
 -  What about the eggs?
 -  OK. Eggs.

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,558
 You buy a dozen eggs, yeah?

223
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,599
 Yep. A dozen is ten.

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,559
 A dozen is 12, stupid.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,638
 I know.

226
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
 Well, Hector has put the number 12 here.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,118
 Well, that's OK. That's one box.

228
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,119
 No. He ordered 12 boxes.

229
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,159
 144.

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,118
 Now...dog food.

231
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,039
 I can't wait.

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
 OK. I'm ready.

233
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,479
 -  We're ready.
 -  Enter.

234
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,239
 Do you like it?

235
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,959
 Well?

236
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,679
 Er... I like the shirt.

237
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,239
 -  I like the sarong.
 -  I like the shoes.

238
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,278
 So...

239
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,799
 am I cool?

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,919
 Erm...

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
 No.

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,439
 I'm not cool.

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 Er...no.

244
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,679
 So...I will go shopping.

245
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,959
 Here we go again. Hector.

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 You can't go out there on your own.
 You went shopping on the Internet.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,398
 Yes.

248
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Your ordered melons instead of lemons
 and too many eggs.

249
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,519
 -  Have you ever been to a supermarket?
 -  No.

250
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 My...

251
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,078
 Who are these?

252
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,079
 My...

253
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,239
 -  Servants?
 -  Yeah. My servants.

254
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,439
 -  Servants. Now I understand.
 -  Come on, Hector.

255
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 -  I will teach you how to shop, Hector.
 -  Till you drop.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,319
 Bridget and I will be the shopkeepers.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 And you are our customer.

258
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,559
 OK.

259
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,438
 -  Good afternoon.
 -  Good afternoon.

260
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,439
 Can I help you, sir?

261
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,319
 What would you like to buy?

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Oh. I would like some...

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,478
 Clothes.

264
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,479
 Yes. I would like some clothes, please.

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,919
 What size?

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,079
 What erm, erm...

267
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,518
 size?

268
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,518
 I don't know.

269
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
 I'll have to measure you, then.

270
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,279
 Arms up, please.

271
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,679
 Arms up, please.

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 Arms up, please.

273
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,999
 Chest.

274
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,758
 112 centimetres.

275
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,759
 Chest, 112 centimetres.

276
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:45,199
 And waist.

277
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,599
 82 centimetres.

278
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,678
 Waist.

279
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,518
 82 centimetres.

280
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,358
 And leg.

281
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,679
 -  I'll do that!
 -  No, it's OK.

282
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 I shall do that.

283
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,918
 Eight...

284
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,118
 y- seven centimetres.

285
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,919
 Now, do you like these trousers?

286
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,759
 Do you like this shirt?

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,198
 Yes.

288
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,199
 Good. That's erm...

289
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,999
 �5,000, please.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,678
 OK.

291
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,719
 No, no, no, Hector.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
 �5,000 is...

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,439
 is...

294
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,318
 8,000 dollars.

295
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,999
 Yeah.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's too much. It's too expensive.

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,439
 Not for Hector.

298
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,839
 So...

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I am ready to go shopping.

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,119
 -  Good luck.
 -  Yeah. Good luck.

301
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 You'll need it.

302
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 Where's my lemon drink, Nick?

303
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,759
 Nick, are there any more tissues?

304
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 All right. I'm coming as fast as I can.

305
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
 OK.

306
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,439
 Oh. I feel awful.

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 Me too. Nothing will make me feel better.

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 Can you get that, please, Nick?

309
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,759
 Ah, it's only Hector.

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,198
 Well?

311
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,199
 Is it...cool?

312
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 Wow, man. Well done, you look great.

313
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,559
 I would like a shirt, please.

314
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Excellent. Oh, the clothes are super.

315
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 And a pair of trousers.

316
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,679
 Oh. You are clever, Hector.

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 And a pair of shoes, please.

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I have been shopping!

319
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
 Oh, I'll get it.

320
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,838
 Hello?

321
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,879
 -  It's me.
 -  Oh, hello.

322
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,839
 It's the tarantula.

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,278
 How are you?

324
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,718
 -  Fine, thank you.
 -  Oh, good, good.

325
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,478
 -  How's your cold?
 -  How's my cold?

326
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 -  Well, how do you know I have a cold?
 -  You told me this morning.

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,118
 Me.

328
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,119
 -  I am Bridget.
 -  I don't believe you.

329
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,559
 Yes. I have a cold.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 -  Thank you.
 -  Oh, I'm sorry.

331
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,798
 Yes. Silly me.

332
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,598
 I told you this morning.

333
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,599
 Why are 400 tins of dog food here for Annie?

334
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,799
 Pardon?

335
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,839
 I don't know.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,398
 -  How strange.
 -  400 tins!

337
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,399
 Yes, that's a lot of tins. I really don't know.

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 -  Can you ask Annie?
 -  Yes, I'll ask Annie.

339
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 Goodbye.

340
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,879
 The tarantula said

341
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 why are 400 tins of dog food downstairs?

342
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 400 tins?

343
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,119
 Hector...

344
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,639
 Next time in Extra...

345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
 Annie goes dating on the Internet,

346
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,839
 and so do Nick and Hector.

347
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

348
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,719
 But do they like their dates?

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
 But do they like their dates?

1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,600
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,639
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,478
 Hector and Annie were in love,

4
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,479
 but now things are not so good.

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,079
 Bridget has given up on love,

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 And Nick -  well, his mum loves him!

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra!

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,438
 Hector.

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,439
 -  Yes?
 -  Please could you pass the salt?

10
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,079
 Yes.

11
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,399
 Hector.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,638
 Yes?

13
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,639
 Please could you pass the pepper?

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 Of course.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,278
 Hector.

16
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,279
 Let me guess.
 Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Actually, I was going to say we should talk.

18
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,639
 So, now you want to talk to me!

19
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,399
 It's only been a week!

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 -  I was hurt!
 -  Well, you hurt me too.

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,959
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!

22
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,119
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,478
 There were other people there, too.

24
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,479
 -  Who?
 -  People who work on the programme.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 You mean other women
 who work on the programme.

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,478
 Yes, and men -  why not, huh?

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,519
 I knew it!

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,079
 So, who is she?

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,758
 -  Who?
 -  The other woman.

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,239
 There is no other woman!

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 Huh!

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 Annie, listen.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,679
 Excuse me.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 Hello. Hi, Debbie.

35
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,119
 How are you? Good.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.

37
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,958
 Bye.

38
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,879
 So, was that her?

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

40
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,079
 That was Debbie from the make- up department,
 confirming my call time for tomorrow.

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 Some excuse!

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,398
 -  Hector.
 -  Yes.

43
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,399
 Please could you pass me your fork?

44
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,639
 Here, I'm going.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 You can have my dinner!

46
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,879
 You should have seen Eunice's face!

47
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,079
 She was furious!

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 When Eunice gets angry,
 she is a very scary lady!

49
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,239
 Hello.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,678
 Yes.

51
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,679
 Excuse me. No, no, to her...

52
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,239
 Bye, Bridget.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 All right, Hector. Bye.

54
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,359
 Hola, Lola!

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 -  Guess what?
 -  Prince William wants to marry you?

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 I know that! No, I've got a promotion!

57
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,278
 That's nice.

58
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,998
 Nice? Nice!

59
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,999
 It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

60
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
 Eunice is no longer my boss!

61
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,078
 Is that Hugh Grant?

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,079
 It's Bridget Evans here.
 Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
 Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?

64
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,239
 Fab! Ciao!

65
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,038
 Eunice is so jealous!

66
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,039
 Now, that is good news.

67
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
 Annie, what are you doing?

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,678
 I'm doing my own editing.

69
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,679
 Why are you cutting up
 photos of you and Hector?

70
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,999
 Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,798
 Really?

72
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,839
 Why?

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Because he is having an affair!

74
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,239
 Really?! Who with?

75
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,599
 Well, I thought it was Eunice,
 but now I think it's Debbie.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.

77
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,279
 Lola? Who's she?

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
 He's women mad!

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,038
 It's fantastic!

81
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,039
 I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

82
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,319
 Hola, Lola!

83
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,918
 I didn't go out with Eunice!

84
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,919
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,319
 So, was that her?

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

87
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,039
 Hi, Nick.

88
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,438
 What are you doing?

89
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,439
 I am not doing, I am being.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,719
 What are you being?

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 -  Can't you guess?
 -  A man on the toilet?

92
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,679
 A Sumo wrestler?

93
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,479
 Can't you see? I am an egg.

94
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,039
 Of course, you are an egg.

95
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,479
 Now, what sort of egg am I?

96
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,079
 Hard- boiled.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,999
 -  Scrambled.
 -  Scrambled?

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 -  Fried.
 -  Nearly!

99
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,759
 Poached!

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
 Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.

101
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,318
 Yeah.

102
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,319
 Well, you're making a mess on your bed!

103
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,959
 It's my new acting class.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Total Being.

106
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,318
 What are you next week? A piece of wood?

107
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,319
 -  A piece of wood?
 -  Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,159
 Anyway, can poached eggs talk?

109
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,118
 Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.

110
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,958
 No, no, I mean,

111
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,959
 when you are
 'being' a poached egg, can you talk?

112
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,958
 Yeah.

113
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,959
 Anyway, I want to stop now,
 my arms are hurting.

114
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,198
 So, what do you want to talk about?

115
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,199
 It is Annie.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,919
 She thinks I am having an affair.

117
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
 -  Who with?
 -  Eunice.

118
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,038
 -  And Debbie.
 -  What?

119
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,399
 Two women, Hector!

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,438
 You cheeky thing!

121
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,439
 But I am not!

122
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,879
 -  So tell Annie then.
 -  I have but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,639
 -  Why not?
 -  I don't know.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 Excuse me.

125
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,639
 Hola, Lola.

126
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,678
 I'll take this outside.

127
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,879
 How are you, Lola?

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 So, it's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?

129
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,599
 Stop, please!

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
 I knew it!

131
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,519
 It had to be a selfish man- driver!

132
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,359
 Please, I have a voucher.

133
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.

134
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,279
 Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 People park on yellow lines and then are
 surprised when they get a parking ticket!

137
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 There was this one guy today - 
 'Please, I have a voucher.'

138
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,438
 No excuse!

139
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,439
 Mind you, he was quite cute.

140
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,958
 Nick.

141
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 Nick, are you OK?

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.

143
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,998
 Well, there's something wrong with Nick.

144
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,999
 -  Well, I could have told you that!
 -  No, he won't speak, he won't move.

145
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
 I know. He is being a poached egg.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 -  A what?
 -  For his new acting class.

147
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,919
 Hi, Nick.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,758
 Let me guess.

149
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,759
 You are being - a potato.

150
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,599
 Do I look like a potato?

151
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,839
 Yes. A couch potato!

152
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,118
 What about a fish?

153
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,119
 Yes, a frozen fish!

154
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,759
 I am not a fish.

155
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
 I...am...'Pain'.

156
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,758
 You are a pain.

157
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,759
 Yes, Nick is a pain!

158
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 No! I am 'Pain'.

159
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
 Hurt, agony.

160
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,039
 So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?

161
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,078
 What a day!

162
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,079
 I had a very important meeting.
 Big decisions to make.

163
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,959
 Like which celebrities,
 new programme ideas?

164
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
 No, like which pen to use at my meeting?

165
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,478
 Blue, black...

166
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,479
 -  Which one did you choose?
 -  Blue.

167
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,519
 Bad choice.

168
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
 You think so? Oh, no!

169
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,959
 Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job,
 she won't talk to anyone!

170
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 -  Not even you?
 -  Not even me! It is great!

171
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
 You don't want her to talk to you?

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
 -  Really?
 -  Really!

173
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
 Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,438
 So do I.

175
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,439
 -  I miss you.
 -  I miss...

176
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 Hola, Lola.

177
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 Right. Two can play that game.

178
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,759
 I am not doing, I am being.

179
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 A man on the toilet?

180
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,280
 Yeah!

181
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.

182
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,879
 It's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be -  Lola?

183
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 Hola, Lola!

184
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?

185
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,599
 I am just doing my job - Zeus!

186
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,079
 -  Hello again.
 -  Hello.

187
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,199
 -  We meet again.
 -  You're happier today.

188
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,639
 Yes, I am now!

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,479
 But I'm sorry...

190
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 I parked here, so you would come back.

191
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,238
 You wanted to see me again?

192
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,239
 You are so beautiful!

193
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,919
 Well, I'm sorry
 but I am going to have to give you...

194
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,358
 -  No...
 -  This!

195
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,159
 My phone number.

196
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Call me.

197
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,439
 Who needs Hector?

198
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,719
 Hi, Bridget.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,518
 What 'oh'?

200
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,438
 I know -  Superman!

201
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,118
 -  What?
 -  I mean, Clark Kent.

202
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,839
 You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.

203
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,519
 No. I'm not.

204
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
 I'm long- sighted.

205
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,479
 You're being long- sighted?

206
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,518
 No.

207
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,598
 I am long- sighted.

208
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,599
 I need to wear glasses for reading.

209
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,799
 They suit you.

210
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 Thank you.
 So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?

211
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,319
 I'm working from home today.

212
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,878
 I've so much to do!

213
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,198
 Bridget, what's the matter?

214
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:48,199
 I can't do it! Eunice hates me!

215
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,399
 Eunice hates everybody!

216
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 -  They all hate me!
 -  No, they don't!

217
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 -  They all look at me!
 -  Bridget, you are their boss.

218
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,319
 I have to use the executive loo!

219
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,799
 What's the matter with that?

220
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 I want to chat to all the girls!

221
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,999
 Bridget...

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 you are one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful women I know.

223
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,518
 Really?

224
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,519
 -  Well, who are the others?
 -  What do you mean?

225
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,119
 You said I was only one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful girls you know.

226
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 Bridget! You can do this job.

227
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Channel 9 needs you.

228
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,239
 -  Thank you, Nick.
 -  Hey, it was nothing.

229
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,519
 You really look handsome in those glasses.

230
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,438
 Hi, Annie.

231
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,518
 Hi, Hector.

232
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,519
 -  You look smart.
 -  Yes, I am going to meet someone.

233
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 Annie, I have something to tell you.

234
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,519
 Sorry.

235
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
 Lola!

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 Vale. Si, si, ya voy.

237
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 Hasta luego.

238
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
 'Annie, I have something to tell you.'

239
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 That he is going on a date with Lola!
 That's what!

240
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

241
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,719
 Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.

242
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 Nick! Stop it!

243
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Is everybody happy, apart from me?

244
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,639
 Hello.

245
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,038
 Zeus! Hi!

246
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,039
 Well, of course I remember you!

247
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,598
 A drink? Tonight?

248
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,599
 Well, I'd love to.

249
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 Stop it! You're tickling me!

250
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.

251
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 -  Hi.
 -  Hi.

252
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,119
 Well, hello, Zeus!

253
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,758
 Annie, where did you find him?

254
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,759
 Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses,
 though, does he?

255
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,959
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?

256
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,079
 Wonderful, Annie.

257
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,319
 Now I must say goodnight.

258
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 Please, first may I use your bathroom?

259
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,839
 -  Certainly.
 -  Thank you.

260
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 Zeus is such a gentle man.

261
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,639
 He certainly is a man.

262
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,439
 Hi.

263
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,479
 Annie, I must talk to you.

264
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 What about? Your date with Lola?

265
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,758
 My date with Lola?

266
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,759
 Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old
 chief executive for ATV.

267
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 -  What's ATV?
 -  Argentinian Television.

268
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,158
 And...

269
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,159
 She wants me to return to Argentina
 to present their number one show.

270
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,679
 But I don't want to go.

271
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
 I want to stay here - with you.

272
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,559
 That's better.

273
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Hector, this is...

274
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 Zeus, my new boyfriend.

275
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,879
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!

277
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,199
 So, Hector, will you take the job?

278
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,839
 What do you think I should do, Annie?

279
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 So we must say goodbye
 to our friends for now.

280
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,759
 Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?

281
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 Will Annie go with him?

282
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

283
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,039
 Extra - will the story continue?!

284
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,159
 Extra - will the story continue?!

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,798
 Hector works for Channel 9.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,399
 Annie is getting jealous.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Bridget has seen it all before.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 And Nick just wants to have fun.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,118
 Hello, Nick. Have you lost a button?

9
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,119
 Hi, Bridget.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
 I'm just...

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,079
 practising.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,198
 Practising what?

13
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,199
 I am going to join the SAS.

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,159
 The Special Air Service?

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 -  Yeah.
 -  You?

16
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,319
 What's so funny?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 Nick, the SAS is for tough guys,

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,959
 real men who are fit.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
 They're highly trained.

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 I was in the Scouts.

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
 You...

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 were in the Scouts?

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,359
 Annie.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 Nick's going to join the SAS.

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 That's wonderful, Nick.
 Don't you need special training?

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 It's OK, he was in the Scouts.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,718
 Hello.

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,719
 Here in the National Camping Exhibition...

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,918
 There's Hector.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 ..it is all tents, tents, tents.

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 In every shape, size and colour.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,558
 And Eunice.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,559
 -  And we will be showing you the best...
 -  And the worst of camping.

34
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,958
 So, stick around.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,879
 Back to studio.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags,
 Hector?

38
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,919
 Calm down, Annie, it's only a television report.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 I know but, well,
 he's been working with Eunice a lot recently.

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,758
 And?

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
 And, well, I'm just worried that he...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,198
 well, that she...

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,998
 You know.

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,999
 Annie, don't be silly.
 You've got nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
 Although...

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 Hector is a good- looking man.

47
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,119
 Yep, and she's a good- looking woman.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
 Incoming, Broad Sword calling Danny Boy,

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Broad Sword calling Danny Boy...

50
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,678
 I was watching that.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,278
 Not any more. Go on, it's late.

52
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
 Back to your own tent.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,159
 What's so funny?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,438
 You.

55
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,278
 A Scout.

56
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,158
 Yeah, so?

57
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,159
 I can just imagine.

58
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,039
 Trying to light fires.

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
 Jessop, you cheat.

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 Helping old ladies across the road.

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
 Tying knots.

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 -  What was that?
 -  I didn't hear anything.

63
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,638
 Hello, Hector.

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
 Good evening, Annie.

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,839
 Don't you mean 'good morning'?

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,678
 Where have you been?

67
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,679
 You know, for a couple of beers.

68
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,878
 Who with?

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,879
 With the lads.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 So when did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 I forgot, Eunice was there too.

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 So what did you talk about?

73
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,759
 Tents.

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,118
 Tents?

75
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,119
 You talked about tents all night?

76
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,039
 Where? In her tent?

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,999
 Or yours?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Annie. Annie...

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 I am going to join the SAS.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
 I was in the Scouts.

81
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

82
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Where have you been?

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 When did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,119
 Yes! I've got it!

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,398
 It was my turn for the toy.

86
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 No, you've got the Incredible Hulk.

87
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,599
 So I get two turns.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 -  Hey, Nick.
 -  Yeah?

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 What do you think of Eunice?

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,118
 Well, she isn't an English rose.

91
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,119
 No, I don't think she is a flower.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
 No, it's a saying.

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
 An English rose -  a sweet, pretty girl.

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,318
 -  Like Annie.
 -  No.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,319
 Eunice is not a sweet, pretty girl.

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 No. Eunice is more...

97
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
 What is that plant that grows all over walls
 in England?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,758
 Honeysuckle.

99
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,759
 Wallflower.

100
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
 -  Ivy?
 -  Yeah, ivy.

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 Eunice is more like English ivy.

102
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,519
 -  What do you mean?
 -  Well, she...

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
 Likes dancing?

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,598
 No, she...

105
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,599
 She's all over you?

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
 Do you like it?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 I see trouble ahead.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 What's so funny?

109
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,118
 Come on.

110
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,119
 Share the joke.

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
 It's Hector.

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Hector came home late last night, is that it?

113
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,959
 He was out with Eunice.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,158
 Don't worry about Eunice.

115
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,159
 She likes flirting, that's all.

116
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,759
 This will cheer you up.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 Look what I found.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,519
 It's pictures of us when we were Brownies.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 -  And you're wearing the Brownie uniform.
 -  It still fits.

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
 Look at all your badges.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 What was the Brownie law?

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 A Brownie Guide thinks of others
 before herself...

123
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 And does a good turn every day.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,958
 Remember the Brownie law, Annie.

125
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,999
 OK.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,918
 OK.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
 Hello, Hector. How are you?

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,879
 Fine.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,999
 Did you have a good night's sleep?

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,599
 What was left of it.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 Dib- dib, dob- dob.

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,519
 What's all this, then?

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 It is the Brownie salute.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,879
 That's not a salute.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 This is a salute.

136
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
 -  What do you think, Hector?
 -  Well, both salutes are nice.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,879
 -  Brownies.
 -  Or Scouts.

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,078
 -  Brownies.
 -  Scouts.

139
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,158
 What are you talking about?

140
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
 What are Brownies? Biscuits?

141
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 When Bridget and I were little girls,
 we were Brownies.

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,119
 We went camping, we sang songs.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,959
 We were given badges for good work.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,878
 Brownies are for girls.

145
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,879
 In the Scouts we survived.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 It was just like being in the SAS, wasn't it, Nick?

147
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,558
 Yeah.

148
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,719
 So what are all those badges for?

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,678
 This one is for first aid.

150
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,679
 And what is second aid or third aid?

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 First aid is for helping people who are hurt.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
 How hurt?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,839
 Like if they can't breathe.

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,078
 Shall I demonstrate, Bridget?

155
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,079
 Go ahead, Annie.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Lie down, please, Hector.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
 Now, this is called the kiss of life.

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,358
 Sounds good.

159
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,359
 It means I breathe into your mouth.

160
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
 And if you still can't breathe, I do this.

161
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
 Well, that is...

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 And I keep doing this until you can breathe.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,638
 Are you breathing yet?

164
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
 Yes, yes, yes, I can breathe.

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
 And that is my good turn for the day.

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,278
 Now, Nick,

167
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
 bites and stings.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,599
 No, thanks.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,439
 Of course, when I was in the Scouts,

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,358
 I went camping.

171
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,918
 So did we.

172
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,919
 Ah, but this was proper camping, survival.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,198
 What? Like the SAS?

174
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
 We had to live off the land.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
 What? No tins of baked beans?

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 No.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,039
 So could you do a survival test?

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,119
 Yeah, no problem.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,319
 Yeah.

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
 Right, then.

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,638
 We will give you a survival test.

182
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,639
 Great.

183
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,878
 What is a survival test?

184
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,358
 You'll see.

185
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 Just be prepared.

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,279
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 -  Certainly am.
 -  OK. Test number one.

188
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
 The jungle is full of horrible things
 that creep and crawl.

189
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,959
 And some that wriggle everywhere.

190
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,638
 Especially...

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 worms!

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,878
 OK.

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,879
 Test number two.

194
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,479
 Food.

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 You have run out of food,

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 so you have to eat whatever you can find.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 Open very wide, please.

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 Ready?

199
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,119
 Beetles!

200
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,398
 OK.

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,158
 Test number three.

202
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,159
 Pain.

203
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,558
 I haven't touched you yet.

204
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 I'm sorry, boys,
 you have failed the survival test.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,798
 But in the jungle

206
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,198
 it is going to be different.

207
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,199
 Yeah, we were just pretending.
 It wasn't real.

208
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
 What? Like real camping?

209
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,719
 -  Why don't we do it?
 -  Do what?

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
 -  Let's go camping.
 -  We haven't got a tent.

211
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 Well, Hector can get us a tent
 from the National Camping Exhibition.

212
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,158
 Well, isn't tomorrow
 the last day of the exhibition?

213
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,318
 Yeah.

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,319
 And you and Eunice will be doing another report.

215
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,158
 Yeah.

216
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
 Well, then, you can buy a tent
 and come home early.

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,878
 You'll miss your drinks after work.

218
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,879
 Shame.

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
 What do you think of Eunice?

220
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,359
 I see trouble ahead.

221
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
 Lie down, please, Hector.

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
 That's not a salute.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is a salute.

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,518
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

225
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
 Certainly am.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Worms.

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 Beetles!

228
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,439
 Let's go camping.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,199
 In the jungle it is going to be different.

230
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,319
 You will wake Annie.

231
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,519
 Hey, I have an idea.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 I must show you to Annie.

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
 You know, I have a better idea.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,158
 Come, come.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
 Come. You too, come, come.

236
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
 Nick.

237
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,159
 Nick, wake up.

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
 No more beetles!

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,358
 -  Hector.
 -  Nick.

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,118
 -  What's going on?
 -  I've got it.

241
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,719
 -  Got what?
 -  The tent.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 That's nice.

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,799
 -  Come on, let's put it up.
 -  What?

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,039
 The tent.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,719
 Hector.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,079
 -  Have you seen the time?
 -  No.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,918
 It's three o'clock in the morning!

248
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
 -  Is it?
 -  Yeah.

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,878
 Really?

250
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,879
 Wait a minute.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,439
 Where have you been?

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,438
 For a couple of beers.

253
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,879
 And a dance.

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 What's that on your collar?

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,438
 Paint.

256
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,439
 Pink paint. That's nice.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,158
 When Annie wakes up,

258
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,638
 she is going to be cross with me.

259
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,118
 If she sees that on your collar, she will be.

260
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,238
 Have you been dancing with Eunice?

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,638
 Yes.

262
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,038
 You are dead.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
 But...when Annie sees that I bought the tent...

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,918
 she is going to forgive me.

265
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
 At three o'clock in the morning?

266
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,199
 Late- night shopping.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
 It is OK, Charley, it is me, Hector.

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,358
 Where shall we put it?

269
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,479
 Here.

270
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,638
 Here.

271
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,598
 In the middle.

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
 Guy ropes.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,318
 What?

274
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,599
 -  Guy Ropes, who is he?
 -  No.

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,078
 Guy ropes.

276
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,079
 Ropes called guy ropes.

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 Somewhere here.

278
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,438
 -  Look.
 -  That's them.

279
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 Tie them to the furniture.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,638
 There. That is it.

281
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
 Right, let's go to bed.

282
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,518
 What? What's this?

283
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,798
 Who put that there?

284
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Hi, Annie. I've bought you a tent.

285
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,118
 What is going on?

286
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,119
 Well, do you like your tent?

287
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,159
 Anyone for camping?

288
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,278
 It's so cold.

289
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,199
 I'll warm you up.

290
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,358
 Did somebody say something?

291
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,959
 I want a hot drink.

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,518
 We can't even make a fire.

293
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,519
 And there's no water left.

294
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,359
 How long have we been here?

295
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 It feels like ages.

296
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,999
 It's so creepy.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Yeah. Very creepy.

298
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,719
 Are you tired, Hector?
 Did you have another late night with Eunice?

299
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,879
 So who's going to go outside
 and get us some water?

300
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,238
 Well, I won't.

301
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,239
 Well, I won't either.

302
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,638
 All right, I'll go,

303
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,639
 but if I'm not back in ten minutes,
 you can have my Action Man collection.

304
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off you go.

305
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,919
 Morning, Nick, dear.

306
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
 Thought you and your friends
 would like a nice cup of tea.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,999
 Thanks, Mum.

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Thanks, Mrs Jessop.

309
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,718
 Next time in Extra...

310
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,518
 Bridget gets a new job.

311
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,519
 Hector receives a phone call from Lola.

312
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,479
 And Annie is looking for trouble.

313
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,438
 It's not Eunice. It's not Debbie.

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

315
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

316
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,399
 Could it be Lola?

1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 and the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector fro Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Annie are in love.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
 Bridget likes to party and party.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 And Nick will do anything
 to earn some money.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,198
 I love this time of year.

8
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 Sleigh bells, mince pies,
 presents under the tree!

9
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,519
 What? Easter?

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 No, silly! Christmas!

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 I'm going to show you what
 a traditional English Christmas is like.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 Starting with...mistletoe.

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,999
 Mistle-toe?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,958
 It's an English tradition.

15
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,959
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
 But I am not under any mistletoe.

17
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,919
 You are now.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,159
 Oh, you poor things!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,398
 You're stuck together again.

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,399
 Don't worry, I can help!

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,798
 There, panic over!

22
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,839
 - Right, I'm off.
 - What?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,918
 Another television party?

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,919
 Not a party, three more parties.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,118
 And that's just tonight.

26
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,119
 But you've been to a Christmas
 party every night for two weeks.

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,159
 I know.
 It's so difficult being so popular.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First, there's a champagne party
 at the Savoy,

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 then at nine o'clock
 I'll get a taxi to the Ritz

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,878
 and get changed on the way...

31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,599
 What? In the taxi?

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,439
 Naturally.

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 And then at 1 1 :30
 I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.

34
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,998
 Annabel - who is she?

35
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,999
 Annabel's - the night club.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 Will you change your clothes
 in the taxi again?

37
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,519
 And there I hope
 I Will meet a young, handsome man.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 An early Christmas present!

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 I hate Christmas!

40
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,079
 Did you have a bad day
 at the grotto, dear?

41
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,759
 - Nick, is that snow?
 - No.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,398
 Well, what,s that on your beard then?

43
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,399
 I was holding this baby...

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 when suddenly...

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
 - Christmas!
 - But children Love Christmas.

46
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,358
 - Is the money good?
 - Yeah.

47
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,399
 Well, stop complaining then!

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Hector and I are going to have
 a lovely Christmas, aren't we?

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 Christmas is all about
 parties and presents!

50
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,079
 So, Bridget, have you got your
 Christmas stocking ready?

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
 She's taking her stockings off
 in the taxi!

52
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,959
 Don't wait up.

53
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,518
 What is a Christmas stocking?

54
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,519
 On Christmas Eve,
 you hang up your Christmas stocking

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes
 and fills it up with presents!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 Who put that sleigh there?

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 My sleigh! I forgot!

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Mind my leq.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 Right, right...
 Whoa! Not too fast!

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,719
 I feel terrible!

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Poor Bridget. Are you in pain?
 - No.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,519
 But what about the parties?
 I can,t go like this!

63
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,599
 I could take you dancing!

64
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,759
 Christmas is cancelled!

65
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,719
 - Is that it?
 - Yeah, crackers are great!

66
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,359
 So, what else
 do you have at Christmas?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Mince pies. How do you make them?

69
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,559
 It's just pastry and mincemeat.

70
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,718
 - Mincemeat?
 - Yeah, it's traditional

71
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,719
 It's sultanas, raisins and spices.
 It's mince...

72
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,079
 - Meat.
 - Yeah.

73
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,159
 Listen to this.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 What do you get
 if you cross a chicken with a clock?

75
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,719
 - I don't know.
 - An alarm cluck!

76
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,319
 An alarm cluck!

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 I don't get it.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 An alarm cluck!

79
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,999
 One a cluck, two a cluck...

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,079
 A clock?

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,398
 Mistle-toe?

82
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,319
 It's an English tradition.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 I was holding this baby...
 when suddenly...

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 It's so difficult being so popular.

86
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,639
 My sleigh! I forgot!

87
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,158
 Mince pies!

88
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,999
 First, the pastry!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And now the minced meat
 from the best butcher!

90
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,439
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

91
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Well, I've finished
 all my Christmas shopping.

92
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,198
 Oh, madam!

93
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,199
 Refreshment? Mince pie?

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,958
 I followed the re-ceep.

96
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,879
 - Pee.
 - Mince pee?

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,478
 No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.

98
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,479
 Re-ci-pe.

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,918
 Something wrong?

101
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
 Delicious...Delicious.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 You know, Hector,
 Christmas is all about sharing.

103
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,279
 Would you like some, Charley?

104
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,439
 It's Saint Nicholas!

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,878
 What happened to your beard?

106
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,879
 One Christmas candle,
 one small child...

107
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,759
 Mince pies, yummy!

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 With best mince from the best butcher.

109
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 Hector. What did you put in the pies?

110
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,199
 Minced meat - from the best butcher.

111
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,598
 This is mincemeat.

112
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,599
 This is minced meat.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,958
 Isn't it the same thing?

114
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,959
 - Not quite.
 - Delicious!

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,278
 I've got an idea!

116
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 Let's make this a special Christmas,
 just for Bridget.

117
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 Night-night.

118
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,999
 Hey, Bridget.

119
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,239
 - Do you want to come carol singing?
 - Who is Carol?

120
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,439
 Carols are Christmas songs.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 You knock on people's doors
 and sing to them for money.

122
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,799
 - Let's do it!
 - For charity!

123
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 For poor little children.

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Some children have no Christmas.

125
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,599
 Just like me.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And your job as Santa Claus
 is so important.

127
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,959
 You help children
 to believe in Christmas!

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.

129
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,958
 My job is important!

130
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
 I help children to believe!

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,039
 Right, let's go!

132
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,638
 And that Will make you happy?

134
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,639
 Here, have a mince pie.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 All right.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Away in a manger...

137
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 Dog in a manger more like! Good night!

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 Silent night...

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
 I wish you were - all night!

140
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
 We Three Kings of Orient are

141
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,518
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

142
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,158
 Get Iost!

143
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,399
 Merrlly on high...

144
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,159
 Get 'em, Gnasher!

145
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 Come all ye faithful

146
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,479
 Joyful and tri...

147
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,879
 Hi, Annie. I like the tree.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Thank you. It's nearly finished.

149
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 Please, use these. My decorations.

150
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,558
 Oh, sweet, Hector.

151
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,559
 - Are they from Argentina?
 - No.

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 Oxford Street.

153
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 - Aren't they great?
 - Great.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Hi, Nick.
 How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Great! Such nice children.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 One of them
 let me play with his binoculars!

157
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,558
 Really?

158
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,159
 And I've just finished
 my Christmas shopping.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 - But the shops are shut now.
 - No.

160
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,359
 The petrol station was open.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,958
 Look I've bought my mum this.

162
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,279
 A map of Watford.

163
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 - But your mum doesn't live in Watford.
 - I know.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,078
 She might go there one day, though.

165
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,838
 I bought shampoo for my sister.

166
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,438
 Car shampoo.

167
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,439
 Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.

168
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 I like the tree...but I Love these!

169
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,998
 I've got some too.

170
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,999
 It was the Iast day of the grotto today,
 so they were throwing these away.

171
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Can you believe it!

172
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,319
 No!

173
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,759
 Perfect.

174
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.

175
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,319
 Why?

176
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties,
 let's have a party here!

177
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,839
 - When?
 - Oh, I don't know.

178
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 In about 15 minutes?

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 Look at the Christmas tree!

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I know. It makes me want to cry too.

181
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
 What's the point of having Christmas
 if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now Christmas just makes me cry!

183
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,118
 Bridget, cheer up.

184
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

185
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,559
 Have you got your stocking?

186
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 Yes.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,519
 And I've got mine!

188
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 What are you hoping for? A motorbike?

189
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,079
 Yes! Why not?

190
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 The only thing
 that Will make this Christmas worse

191
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,799
 is if you invited all my friends round
 for a surprise party to cheer me up.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Surprise!

193
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 And now the minced meat,
 from the best butcher!

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

195
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,639
 We Three Kings of Orient are

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,959
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

197
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 Good night!

198
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,279
 Joyful and tri...

199
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 Surprise!

200
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,359
 Hang on, I,m coming!

201
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 - Merry Christmas!
 - Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.

202
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 I'm sorry,
 we had a little party Iast night.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm here for dinner.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,998
 Isn't it a bit early?

205
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,999
 Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 - Bernard, where's your mother?
 - At church.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Well, I'll just go and get dressed.

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 To Bernard, Love from Annie.

209
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,198
 Sherry. Thanks, Annie.

210
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,638
 Nearly finished this one.

211
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,639
 To Bridget, Love from Annie.

212
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,479
 A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!

213
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label.
 It was meant for Charley.

214
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,479
 Is she sure it was meant for Charley?

215
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 To Bridget, from Hector.

216
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,119
 Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,199
 What To Wear At Christmas Parties.

218
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,999
 I bought it before you...

219
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,239
 I've got a little something for you, Nick.

220
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,519
 Gorilla -
 because you are the original man.

221
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,838
 It smells like a gorilla.

222
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,839
 Well, you should know.

223
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,599
 I wonder what this could be.

224
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,759
 Merry Christmas, sugar plum.

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 One heart, forever.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 This Will stop it!

228
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
 Bridget, nothing Will stop
 my Love for Hector.

229
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,119
 Well...

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I just called to say Merry Christmas!

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Hector.

232
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,879
 Bridget, what has happened to you?

233
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,079
 - I had an accident.
 - Oh, what a pity!

234
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,119
 You've missed some fabulous parties -

235
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,639
 especially at the Beckhams'.

236
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Elton John is a very naughty boy!

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Still, never mind,
 there is always next year.

238
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,438
 OK, must dash.

239
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,318
 Off to a top restaurant for lunch.

240
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,639
 - Eunice?
 - Yes?

241
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?

242
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,679
 I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.

243
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,039
 It's true, there is a Santa!

244
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 And she's a woman! Wait for me!

245
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 I want to tell you
 what I really want for Christmas!

246
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,879
 - Can you smell something?
 - Yeah.

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Is something burning?

248
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
 I forgot - the turkey!

249
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 Water, water! We need water!

250
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,439
 Not on me! On the turkey!

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 Move! Move!

252
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 There. The fire is out.

253
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,879
 Anyone for turkey?!

254
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,998
 Shall we just have pudding?

255
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,999
 No mince pies, thanks.

256
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,958
 I have another surprise for you.

257
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,959
 Another English Christmas tradition.

258
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,479
 Chocolate log. One slice or two?

259
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,799
 Next time in Extra...

260
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,559
 Nick wants to join the SAS,

261
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 Bridget and Annie
 train the boys for action

262
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 and why is Hector home so late?

263
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

264
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,319
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 Nick loves babes and motorbikes

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 and Bridget loves make- up,
 mirrors and chocolate.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,759
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

9
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,239
 It's Marty!

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
 But what Sharon doesn't realise
 is we've got a camera in the bathroom.

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,518
 That's disgusting.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,519
 She must know that we can see her.

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
 I think it is quite clever.

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
 And what are Paul and Mandy doing
 in the living room?

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
 They're kissing. They're kissing.

16
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,558
 They're not kissing. They're whispering.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 What? Do you call this whispering?

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
 Let's think of another name for it.

19
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
 Paul and Mandy said they could live
 without kissing for 24 hours.

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,159
 And look, they've failed.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Paul and Mandy lose points for that.
 We caught them kissing.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,999
 See you after the break.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Can You Live Without...?
 is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.

24
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,279
 Well, I couldn't live
 without kissing Hector for 24 hours.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,758
 Why don't you try?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,759
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 -  I'm not chewing.
 -  Yes, you are. You're always chewing.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 No...

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,079
 I bet you couldn't stop
 chewing gum for 24 hours.

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,678
 Well, yes, I could.

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,679
 And, anyway, you suck your thumb.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 I do not.
 Well, only when I'm stressed.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,079
 -  I've had an idea!
 -  Oh, no!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 We could be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,599
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
 It would be easy.
 Think of the prize money.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,319
 And Marty Ross presents it.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,879
 He would come to my apartment again.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Oh, Marty.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 He's got such good taste.

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
 And this is fantastic. Original.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,078
 What happened to Marty?

43
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
 He said he needed time away from me
 to really appreciate me.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 -  So he dumped you, then.
 -  He did not!

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,479
 Anyway, Bridget,
 are you feeling persuasive?

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,039
 Of course.
 I'm always feeling persuasive.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,759
 Well, it's time to persuade Marty

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,118
 And then Marty can make it happen.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 I'll try.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,839
 Mr Ross to Studio B, please.

52
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
 -  Hello, Marty.
 -  Hello...

53
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,839
 -  Bridget!
 -  Bridget?

54
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,279
 Bridget, Eunice's researcher.
 We had dinner last month.

55
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
 That Bridget. What do you want?

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,238
 I've got something to say.

57
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,239
 Well, I'm not the father.

58
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,039
 -  No! Nothing like that.
 -  Well, what is it, then?

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
 My friends and I want to be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

60
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
 I wish I could help you, but it's not
 my decision, it's the producer's.

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,599
 Now, I must go.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 -  You can't help me? That's a shame.
 -  Yes, it is.

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

64
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,039
 Or this.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,159
 Where did you get them?

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 Don't you remember?
 I'm Eunice's researcher.

67
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,318
 I research.

68
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,319
 I wish I could help you,
 but it's not my decision,

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 it's the newspapers'.

70
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
 All right, all right.
 I'll see what I can do.

71
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,558
 It's time to persuade Marty

72
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,559
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

73
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,559
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

74
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,119
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Or this.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

77
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,079
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

78
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

79
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,279
 It's Marty!

80
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hello, darlings.

81
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 Do you want to spend
 the next 24 hours with me?

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,518
 -  Yeah!
 -  Correct answer!

83
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,519
 Yes, let's see what the people
 who live here...can live without.

84
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,279
 But it looks like
 they live without anything anyway.

85
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
 Well, let's meet the contestants.

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
 You first, pretty lady. What's your name?

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 You already know my name, Marty.

88
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
 We have a pretty joker here.

89
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,559
 Don't get smart, sweetie.

90
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 This is my show, photo or no photo.

91
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,479
 -  Bridget.
 -  Good luck, Bridget.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 -  And who do we have here?
 -  Hello.

93
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,079
 My name is Annie
 and I'm Hector's girlfriend...

94
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,159
 and I love Charley, my dog.

95
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,519
 So, which one could you live without?

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
 Enough said!

97
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 And this is Hector.

98
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 So, Hector,
 Annie loves her dog more than you.

99
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,559
 Mind you, Hector does sound
 like a dog's name, doesn't it?

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 Here, Hector! Here, boy!

101
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,438
 Don't bite!

102
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,439
 And, last of all and least of all...

103
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,959
 it's...

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Hello? Is anybody there?

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 I know, you're a fish.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 Hi. I'm Nick.

107
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,159
 Hi, Nick. And what do you like?

108
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,839
 Bananas!

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,439
 Baboons. You like baboons!

110
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 You are a baboon.
 You're a small baboon.

111
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,358
 No, it's not baboons.

112
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,118
 You like babes!

113
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,119
 Sorry, this is Nick and he likes babes.

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,958
 Well, let's get on with it.

115
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 As usual, each of these contestants
 has picked one thing

116
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 that their flatmates
 cannot live without for 24 hours.

117
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,238
 Bridget...

118
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
 You must live without chocolate...
 mirrors...and make- up.

119
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Annie, you must live without...

120
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 touching Hector, sucking your thumb...

121
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 and, most of all,
 you must live without Charley.

122
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Hector, you must live without...

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
 touching Annie and chewing gum.

124
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,318
 Nick, you must live without...

125
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
 talking about babes
 or talking about motorbikes.

126
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
 And all of you must live without

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 television, magazines and music.

128
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 24 hours of living without starts now.

129
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
 Come on, Charley.
 You're coming with me.

130
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
 Don't forget -  I'll be watching.

131
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,999
 No television!

132
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,958
 No touching.

133
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
 If you touch, we lose points
 and we won't win a big prize.

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 No make- up. What must I look like?

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 And no mirrors!

136
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 Look at that guy.
 He looks like a monkey at the zoo.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 So how will they do? Top points
 could mean a holiday in the Caribbean.

138
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,038
 But if they fail, they lose points

139
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
 and their prize holiday could be this.

140
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,159
 Of course, we might give them one or two
 temptations to make interesting television.

141
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,679
 Join me after the break.

142
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 You must live without touching Hector.

143
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 Nick, you must live
 without talking about babes

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 or talking about motorbikes.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 24 hours of living without starts now.

146
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,718
 I think it's going to rain.

147
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,719
 -  Do you?
 -  I agree.

148
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,798
 Manchester United are doing well.

149
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
 -  Are they?
 -  I agree.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 I think it's going to rain.

151
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
 Weather and football - 
 is that all you can talk about?

152
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 Well, yesterday I met this really cute b...

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Don't say it! Do not talk
 about babes or motorbikes.

154
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,079
 Careful!

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Bridget, no mirrors. You lose ten points.

156
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,439
 But it's not a mirror, it's a kettle.

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
 Don't argue!
 You lose another ten points.

158
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 Well, it's all quiet now.

159
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 What about some temptation?

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Hector, what is in your mouth?

161
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,878
 Nothing.

162
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 -  Are you chewing gum, Hector?
 -  No.

163
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
 No, he's not. He's chewing this.

164
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 Open.

165
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
 That was from the Red Sea.
 It cost a lot of money.

166
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,319
 I could kill for some chocolate.

167
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,599
 This should be fun!

168
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,719
 'Bridget.

169
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 'I love the show, love from...

170
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
 'Orlando Bloom.'

171
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 Orlando Bloom...watching me!

172
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
 I hope you didn't hear me say that.

173
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 What do I look like?
 What do I look like?

174
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,958
 What are you doing, Annie?

175
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm talking to Charley.

176
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,719
 Annie, you must live without Charley.
 You lose ten points.

177
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,199
 What?

178
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,039
 Hector...

179
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 - Don't move!
 -  What is it?

180
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,879
 It's OK, just don't move.

181
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 I'm not going anywhere.

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
 What Hector doesn't know is that
 we've put that spider on his jumper.

183
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,599
 This is wonderful TV

184
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,999
 Think, think!

185
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 One minute.

186
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,599
 That's better.

187
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Now, we'll just
 brush this little fellow off.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 Don't touch it!

189
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
 It's OK.
 I'm sure it's not poisonous.

190
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,038
 How do you know?

191
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,039
 Anyway, if you touch me,
 we will lose points.

192
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 OK.

194
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,919
 Now...stay still.

195
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,159
 Don't move!

196
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 Hang on a minute!

197
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
 Hector, this is a toy.

198
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,999
 I knew that.

199
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,119
 Hector, you were so funny.

200
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 Marty has played a trick on us.

201
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 Yeah, very funny.

202
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,798
 Who's a cross boy?

203
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
 Things are getting really hot now

204
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 and they've still got over 12 hours to go.

205
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,279
 You know, Hector,
 I really think we can do this.

206
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,159
 We can win that holiday.

207
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,758
 Hello, Annie.

208
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,118
 Bridget, what are you doing in there?

209
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,119
 I'm...just reading the electricity meter.

210
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,839
 Come here.

211
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
 Why are you wearing dark glasses?

212
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 I don't want Orlando to see me
 without make- up.

213
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,159
 Bridget! Is that chocolate?

214
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
 No.

215
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
 But they're from Orlando!

216
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 No chocolate, Bridget.
 You lose 100 points.

217
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 Nick has entered the building!

218
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Nick!

219
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 Yes! Annie and Hector touched.
 They lose 200 points.

220
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 -  What?
 -  It was an accident.

221
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,479
 And best of all, Nick,
 you can't live without motorbikes.

222
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 So you lose 500 points.

223
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,199
 No, no, no, no!

224
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 You said no talking about motorbikes,
 actually, big nose!

225
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,278
 Yeah, Marty.

226
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
 So thanks for the present.
 You can keep your holiday.

227
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,119
 What? You can't do that.

228
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Baby, fancy a ride?

229
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
 Yeah!

230
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,678
 Hector, this is for Marty.

231
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,679
 Or should I say...Martina?

232
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 So, Marty, if you want the bike,
 come and get it.

233
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 Sorry, Marty, we can live without you.

234
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
 Goodbye.

235
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,279
 And, Marty, I think your audience
 will love this picture of you.

236
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,438
 Oh, no!

237
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
 Come on, Annie.
 We have lots of catching up to do.

238
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
 Hector, catch me!

239
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,758
 Next time in Extra...

240
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie play under the mistletoe.

241
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie plays under the mistletoe.

1
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,319
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,399
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Annie cares about animals.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,119
 Hector cares about Annie.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,999
 Bridget mostly cares about herself.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,880
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,559
 Bridget Evans?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,438
 Annie Taylor?

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
 So we went to the restaurant
 and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 and I had the peppers
 and Hector had the mushrooms,

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 which was very nice
 because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,999
 so I said to him that it was good for him to try.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,118
 Annie!

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,119
 And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,319
 and it was such a beautiful evening

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,039
 and the birds were singing...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Annie! Will you shut up?

21
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,878
 Sorry.

22
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,879
 You have been talking non- stop
 for 20 minutes.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,759
 I know. It's...

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence
 for the charity Pigs With No Parents.

25
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,719
 Sponsored...silence!

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,279
 So why are you talking?

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk
 a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,118
 Nothing.

30
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,119
 Have you got a spot?
 I'll call an ambulance!

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 No, but I am going to see my beautician later.

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,398
 What for?

33
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,159
 Just for a check- up.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 A check- up? But you go to the dentist
 for a check- up, for your teeth.

35
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,119
 Exactly.
 I'm going to the beautician's to check...

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,999
 Check that you are beautiful?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Of course not.
 I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?

38
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,839
 Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,639
 Nick!

40
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,999
 Nick! What is the matter?

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 You can tell me.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,439
 You have a toothache.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
 Then if you have a toothache,
 you must go to the den...

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 Can't I say the word 'den...'?

45
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 OK, I won't say the D- word.

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 I call him 'plumber'.

47
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,719
 OK, so when did you last see the plumber?

48
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,119
 That's not too bad, five months ago.

49
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,559
 Five years ago?

50
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:27,679
 When you were five years old?

51
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,119
 It is going to be a big job!

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 He'll need a big drill.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,039
 Come on.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 The girls must know a good plumber.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,359
 Come on.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 Do you want a sweetie?

57
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,679
 Do you want a sweetie?

58
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,879
 Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,199
 Hi, sugar plum.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,118
 Hello, snuggly puppykins.

61
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,158
 Nice clothes. New?

62
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,039
 Yeah. Thanks.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 No, he has a toothache
 so he must see the plumber.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 No, no, no, Hector.
 For a toothache, he must see the dentist.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
 I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.

67
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,479
 'Dentist'.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.

69
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,278
 So do you know a good plumber?

70
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,478
 A plumber? What for?

71
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
 Nick has toothache.

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 Well, he doesn't need a plumber.
 He needs a dentist.

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 Yes, Hector, we have
 the number of a very good plumber -  Julian.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,238
 Julian!

75
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,199
 He's so gentle.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,638
 He's so married!

77
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,519
 Hi, Julian.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Listen, we have an emergency here.

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,519
 What are the symptoms?

80
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,199
 Shaking, squealing...

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, just a toothache.

82
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,079
 You can?

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Thank you. Bye.

84
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,798
 Sorted. He'll see Nick now.

85
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,798
 OK, come on, Nick.

86
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,519
 Come on. Come on, Nick.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 Come on...

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 Come on, Nick.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,279
 Julian looked in my mouth once.

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,839
 With a mouth that big,
 I'm surprised he didn't fall in.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,078
 Hello.

93
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,119
 Who's this?

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,358
 Bernard?

95
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,278
 Hello, Bernard.

96
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,999
 Hello, Bernard.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,038
 You've been what?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,078
 Robbed?

99
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,799
 When?

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 When you were in the bath?

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,398
 All your clothes?

102
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,719
 And your keys?

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,038
 Poor Bernard.

104
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
 Listen, you must call the police, OK?

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 OK. Bye.

106
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,799
 Poor Bernard.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 It's ten o'clock!
 My sponsored silence starts now.

108
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
 He'll need a big drill.

109
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,159
 If I talk a lot now,
 then I won't have to talk later.

110
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,039
 Have you got a spot?

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 I'll call an ambulance!

112
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,678
 All your clothes?

113
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,679
 And your keys?

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,319
 Bridget Evans?

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,559
 Annie Taylor?

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
 Why not?

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,719
 You can't speak? I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,759
 You can speak.

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 One word. Three syllables.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 First syllable...

124
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,598
 Sit.

125
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,559
 Seat?

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 Chair?

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,278
 Second syllable.

128
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,719
 A? E?

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 I? I.

130
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,959
 T.

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,839
 Chair- I- T.

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
 Chair- I- T?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're being silent for charity!

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But which charity?

135
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,078
 Cow? Dog? Cat?

136
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,119
 Pig?

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

138
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
 Is this man bothering you, Annie?

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 Because if he is,
 I am going to show him some Argentinian...

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

141
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,838
 ..respect.

142
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,839
 -  And you are?
 -  Hector Romero.

143
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
 I suspect you're not English?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 He is a very good detective.

145
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,718
 And you are?

146
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,678
 Nwiff?

147
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,959
 He's just been to see the plumber.

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
 -  The plumber?
 -  Yes, he had a toothache.

149
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,159
 But you don't go to the plumber
 when you've got a toothache.

150
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,798
 -  You go to the den...
 -  Biscuit?

151
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,799
 Dentist.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery

153
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,078
 of Bernard Reynolds'...

154
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,079
 Somebody has stolen Bernard!

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 There's been a robbery
 of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

156
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
 Who would want Bernard's clothes?

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 So I'm investigating everybody in the building

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 because someone
 has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

159
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 Where were you last night?

160
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,079
 I was with Annie.

161
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 -  Annie...
 -  It's OK.

162
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:50,119
 She can't speak for chair- I- T.

163
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
 Anyway, what about Nwiff?

164
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,799
 I...

165
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Show me, Nick.

166
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
 I went to Leo's Bar.

167
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,639
 I had a beer.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 There was a beautiful girl.

169
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,639
 And a motorbike?

170
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 You were with a young woman on a motorbike?

171
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,879
 Motorbike. Registration?

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 Name of young woman?

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 He wasn't with her.

174
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,079
 The young woman
 was on television on a motorbike!

175
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
 I saw that! Very nice!

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Gee, I'm getting good at this.

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,598
 Bridget Evans?

178
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,599
 Annie Taylor?

179
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Could I have a word with you, please?

181
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
 Chair- I- T?

182
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,599
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

183
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,919
 What about Nwiff?

184
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,598
 Motorbike. Registration?

185
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,599
 Name of young woman?

186
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,878
 There you are!

187
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,679
 Hello, Mr Reynolds.

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,638
 Well, have you caught them?

189
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,679
 -  Who?
 -  The robbers.

190
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,799
 The robbers who stole my clothes.

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 Yes. My investigations are going very well.

192
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,999
 You have a cold, Bernard?

193
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,359
 You need some clothes?

194
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,519
 What a week! First, Mum went away
 to play bingo all weekend.

195
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,679
 Bingo?

196
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,959
 Two fat ladies, 88.

197
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 Clickety- click, 66.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.

199
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,398
 Bingo!

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,399
 Digestives! My favourite.

201
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,678
 You must be Miss Evans.

202
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,679
 And this is Sherlock Holmes!

203
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,519
 Bridget.

204
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 I'd like to ask you a few questions.

205
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!

206
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 What are you staring at?

207
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,759
 Nothing.

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 Is there something wrong with your top lip?

209
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,799
 No.

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Yes, there is. It's bright red.

211
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 It doesn't show, does it?

212
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,878
 No, no, no.

213
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,879
 They told me in the salon no one would notice.

214
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Thank you.

215
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,159
 I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have
 enough money, so a student did them.

216
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,559
 What, a butcher student?

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,358
 There, there. You're still very pretty.

218
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,758
 Am I? Really?

219
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,759
 Really.

220
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,199
 Where were you last night?

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,199
 -  Looking in the mirror.
 -  All night?

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,239
 Yes, all night.

223
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 How can anyone spend all night
 looking at themselves in the mirror?

224
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,039
 Bridget would.

225
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,319
 I think that someone here

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 is not telling the truth

227
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and I think that someone is you.

228
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 But I told you. I was with Annie.

229
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,159
 Annie hasn't said she was with you.

230
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,319
 That's true.

231
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,238
 She can't speak.

232
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 She is doing
 a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.

233
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?

234
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,119
 -  Yes.
 -  Where?

235
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,438
 -  Shopping.
 -  Shopping?

236
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,478
 For what?

237
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,278
 Some new clothes.

238
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,279
 These new clothes?

239
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,278
 Now, let me get this straight.

240
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,279
 You need some new clothes
 and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.

241
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 So what does that tell me?

242
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,079
 Yes, but I...

243
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Why buy new clothes
 when you can steal somebody else's?

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 Yeah!

245
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,239
 Do these look like Bernard's clothes?

246
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 They could be. My colour.

247
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,999
 Oh, no! I spoke!

248
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,599
 You! You made me speak!

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.

250
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 Bernard, it's your mother.

251
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,198
 Hello, Mum. You're back.

252
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:57,199
 How was bingo?

253
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,679
 Mum, someone stole my clothes.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,118
 OK.

255
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,999
 Right, I'm off.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,799
 Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.

257
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,878
 Bernard, what about your clothes?

258
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,719
 It's OK. She's got them.

259
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,999
 -  What?
 -  What? What?

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 She put them in the washing machine
 before she went to bingo.

261
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
 Mum!

262
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,279
 So Bernard's clothes

263
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 were in the washing machine all the time.

264
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
 Well, yes, as I suspected.

265
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.

266
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,439
 No, you won't!

267
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,638
 What?

268
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:01,639
 You owe me �120 for Pigs With No Parents.

269
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,559
 You made me speak!

270
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Well, will dollars do?

271
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,518
 Next time in Extra...

272
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,519
 The girls enter a game show.

273
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.

274
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:25,879
 And guess what Hector finds on his Jumper.

1
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,159
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 and the boys next door,
 Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 Annie works for the environment.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
 And Nick works as little as possible.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
 It's Friday, it's seven o'clock.

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,759
 Yes, it's time for an evening with Marty Ross.

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,879
 And here's Marty!

10
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,239
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

11
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,919
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this afternoon together.

13
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,359
 Marty! Hi.

14
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 I was just writing notes for your show.

15
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,159
 You like what you see?

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 Marty, you're so funny.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,479
 Is Lady Macbeth in?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 -  Who?
 -  The dragon. Eunice.

19
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,359
 No.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,838
 Marty, you're so funny.

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,839
 Has Eunice got me tickets
 for Damian Pollasco's latest exhibition yet?

22
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,798
 Who?

23
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,799
 Damian Pollasco.
 The most important artist this century.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 He's so raw,

25
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,239
 so angry.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
 Of course he is. Silly me. I forgot.

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,359
 Good old Damian.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
 Anyone who is anyone
 will be there tomorrow night.

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,919
 So of course I must be there.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,118
 Yes.

31
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,119
 So tell the dragon if there are no tickets,
 I will not present Saturday's show.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 But you must, Marty. You're the star.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 But if there are tickets,
 then I will take her out to dinner.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,039
 In fact, I'll take anyone out to dinner
 who gets me those tickets.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Anyway, must go. I've got fans to ignore.

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 Well? Carry on.

37
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,879
 Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
 Let's spend this evening together.

38
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,239
 What a professional.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
 So if I get tickets for Damian Pollasco,

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 I get dinner with Marty Ross!

41
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,598
 Who do I know? Who do I know?

42
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,599
 I know! Dave! He's crazy about me.

43
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,719
 Hi, Dave. It's Bridget.

44
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,639
 I've got a little favour to ask you.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 Is anybody home?

46
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,159
 Annie, is that you?

47
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Is that Ziggy? I think you should let her out.

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 No, it's OK. We're seeing
 what it's like to be a battery chicken.

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,359
 A chicken that runs on batteries?

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,479
 -  No.
 -  No!

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
 A chicken that is kept in a small box
 to lay her eggs. Poor thing.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,438
 But isn't Ziggy a bit...

53
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,439
 No. It makes it more real, doesn't it, Ziggy?

54
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
 Tomorrow there is a big Farm Animal
 Freedom Protest in Trafalgar Square

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,318
 and we will be demonstrating.

56
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
 -  Demonstrating what?
 -  What it's like to be a farm animal.

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,879
 Sounds exciting.

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
 Boggy and Moss are coming from Manchester.

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,599
 Boggy and Moss?

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 Boggy and Moss
 are very, very serious eco- warriors.

61
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,479
 Eco- warriors?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 They fight for the environment.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 And you two will help us prepare.

64
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,559
 Won't you, boys?

65
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,439
 Bye.

66
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 Good old Dave. I knew he'd help me.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 He just can't resist me.

68
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,319
 Now...Marty.

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,079
 Hi.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,080
 Hi, Marty. It's Gigi.

71
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,439
 -  Gigi?
 -  Bridget.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 -  Bridget who?
 -  Bridget. Eunice's researcher.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 -  Have we met?
 -  Well, only about one hundred times.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Listen, I've got two preview tickets
 for Damian Pollasco.

75
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,919
 Oh, that Bridget. How could I forget you?

76
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,199
 How about meeting for drinks
 at your place first?

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
 I'd...love to...

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 but it's just a simple loft- style apartment.

79
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,598
 Well, I'm sure it's very arty.

80
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,599
 I can tell a lot about a woman from her art.

81
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,199
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 And if I like your art, Bridget,
 maybe dinner afterwards?

83
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,559
 Marty! What a surprise! I'd love to.

84
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,039
 See you tomorrow, baby.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
 -  Bye.
 -  Ciao.

86
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
 Dinner with Marty,
 dinner with Marty, dinner with Marty!

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,758
 What shall I wear?

88
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,959
 My flat! Arty?

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,078
 Annie, look at this flat.

90
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,959
 Sorry, Bridget.

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
 Right, I've got 24 hours.

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 -  I think you should let her out.
 -  No, it's OK.

93
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
 Boggy and Moss
 are very, very serious eco- warriors.

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
 And you two will help us prepare.

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 I've got two preview tickets for Damian Pollasco.

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

97
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,559
 And what is going on this time?

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 Hi, Bridget. I'm feeding Hector cornflakes.

99
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 Really? And why?

100
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,759
 He's a turkey.

101
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
 Yes, of course he is.

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,919
 Turkeys are made to eat lots for Christmas.

103
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,199
 Well, we all eat lots at Christmas.

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 No, it's cruel.
 It's to make them fat for humans to eat.

105
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
 Let me guess. He is a baby cow?

106
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,599
 Nearly. He is a veal calf. Poor thing.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We're preparing
 for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,559
 No, you're not.

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 You're preparing this flat
 because Marty Ross is coming for drinks.

110
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,439
 Not Marty Ross?

111
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,119
 Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

113
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
 So this preparation, what is it?

114
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,519
 I want this flat to look
 like the coolest art gallery in London.

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 The Tate Modern.

116
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,839
 -  The Tate Modern?
 -  No furniture.

117
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,079
 I want 21st century. I want art.

118
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,279
 So how are you going to do this?

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 I'm not going to do it.

120
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,199
 You are.

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,838
 I must get my beauty sleep.

122
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
 See you in the morning. Have fun.

123
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,479
 Well, I'm not doing it.

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 Come on, Nick. It won't take long.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
 I'll give Ziggy the keys to your flat.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 OK, let's get on with it.

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
 There! That's better.

128
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,159
 Marty will love it.

129
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
 The things I do for Bridget's love life.

130
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,439
 What about Bridget's love life?

131
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,679
 Right, I'll be back with Marty at six o'clock,

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,319
 so, Annie, I want nibbles...

133
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,838
 -  Nibbles?
 -  Nuts, crisps.

134
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,119
 Hector, you prepare the drinks.

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
 And Nick...

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,919
 try to be more interesting.

137
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 Now, don't let me down.

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
 I want 21st century. I want art.

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
 Yeah...

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 I'll show her interesting.

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm taking the day off work today.

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 No, you're not.
 We've got lots to do before tonight.

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,718
 Bridget's nibbles?

144
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,719
 No! The Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 Boggy and Moss are coming here
 and I want you to look after them, Hector. OK?

146
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,559
 Come on, Ziggy.

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
 Interesting?
 I'll show you interesting, Bridget Evans.

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 Interesting, interesting!

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 No, too Picasso.

150
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,519
 No, too sporty and stupid.

151
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,919
 Yes! This is the one.

152
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 No.

153
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,199
 Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
 Nearly. Not quite.

155
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 Bingo!

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,799
 Poor thing.

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 We're preparing
 for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

158
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,319
 I want 21st century. I want art.

159
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,919
 Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

160
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
 Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

161
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 Oggy? Moth?

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Excuse me, I am... Nuts...

163
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
 Come in, come in.

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
 Please...sit down.

165
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 So, you are Annie's friends?

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
 I am Annie's boyfriend.

167
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 Would you like a drink?

168
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 You would? You wouldn't?

169
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 Tea? Coffee? Sugar?

170
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,318
 It is my phone.

171
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,959
 I know you know it is a phone,

172
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,960
 but it is ringing, so I must...

173
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 Excuse me.

174
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,038
 Annie, I'm so happy you rang.

175
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
 Hector, I'm in the ladies' toilets
 in Trafalgar Square.

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,398
 Have Boggy and Moss arrived yet?

177
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,759
 Yes.

178
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 Annie, they are a bit...

179
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,959
 Aren't they sweet?

180
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,959
 Yes, very sweet.

181
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 It is just that they...

182
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,639
 All right, chaps? Won't be a minute.

183
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 It is just that they are a bit scary.

184
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,879
 Hector, don't be so silly.

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 Tell them to come to Trafalgar Square now.

186
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Great.

187
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 You found something to eat. Good.

188
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,359
 You like them?

189
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Good, good, good.

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
 Annie says you can go to Trafalgar Square. Now.

191
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 It is the phone again.

192
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 Phones ring, don't they? They...

193
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,279
 Excuse me.

194
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,719
 Hello.

195
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 Hello, Hector. Did you get the nibbles?

196
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,039
 The nibbles. The nibbles.

197
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,038
 Yes, of course, Bridget.

198
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 Well done, Hector. I knew I could rely on you.

199
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
 That was Bridget, Annie's fr...

200
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,599
 Now am I interesting?

201
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
 Do I look that bad?

202
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
 This is interesting!

203
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 What shall I do? It was Boggy and Moss.

204
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
 Look, don't worry. We can tidy this up.

205
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,199
 Look. See? Look.

206
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
 Yeah, that looks much better.

207
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 -  Still, at least I've brought the drinks.
 -  And I have the nibbles.

208
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
 -  What?
 -  The nibbles.

209
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,278
 Very good.

210
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,279
 Oh, no! Boggy and Moss ate them.

211
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 Look at this!

212
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,999
 Tastes good.

213
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 See? Bridget won't even notice the mess.

214
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,359
 Marty, you're so funny.

215
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,119
 Anyway, here is my humble home.

216
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
 Mr Ross, I'm a huge fan.

217
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 What is that?

218
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 It's a pigpen. We stole it from a farm lorry.

219
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,038
 What a shame, no pig.

220
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,039
 Boggy and Moss are bringing her later.

221
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
 -  This place...
 -  This place is very...

222
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,798
 I'm so angry!

223
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,799
 ..angry. I love it!

224
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 Yes. Yes, it's my angry art phase.

225
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,758
 All my own ideas, you know.

226
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,759
 -  Cocktail?
 -  Nibble?

227
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And this is fantastic. Original?

228
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,998
 Very original.

229
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,999
 Very Damian Pollasco. I love art.

230
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
 They call me Arty Marty, you know.

231
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 Is it...for sale?

232
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
 The man's an idiot. He wants to buy a wall.

233
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,198
 Much too expensive.

234
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,199
 Much too precious.

235
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
 Name your price.

236
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,519
 Can you deliver them to me tomorrow?

237
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 Sure. No problem.

238
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,038
 Nick, what's this cocktail called?

239
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,519
 It's an Arty Marty.

240
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 It's rich, sickly and very thick.

241
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,239
 Nick, your date is here.

242
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,319
 Of course she is.

243
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
 Next time in Extra...

244
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,599
 Nick goes to the dentist.

245
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,638
 Annie can't speak.

246
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,639
 And why does an inspector call?

247
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,038
 And why does an inspector call?

1
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,319
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,399
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Annie cares about animals.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,119
 Hector cares about Annie.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,999
 Bridget mostly cares about herself.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,880
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,559
 Bridget Evans?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,438
 Annie Taylor?

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
 So we went to the restaurant
 and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 and I had the peppers
 and Hector had the mushrooms,

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 which was very nice
 because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,999
 so I said to him that it was good for him to try.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,118
 Annie!

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,119
 And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,319
 and it was such a beautiful evening

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,039
 and the birds were singing...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Annie! Will you shut up?

21
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,878
 Sorry.

22
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,879
 You have been talking non- stop
 for 20 minutes.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,759
 I know. It's...

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence
 for the charity Pigs With No Parents.

25
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,719
 Sponsored...silence!

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,279
 So why are you talking?

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk
 a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,118
 Nothing.

30
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,119
 Have you got a spot?
 I'll call an ambulance!

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 No, but I am going to see my beautician later.

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,398
 What for?

33
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,159
 Just for a check- up.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 A check- up? But you go to the dentist
 for a check- up, for your teeth.

35
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,119
 Exactly.
 I'm going to the beautician's to check...

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,999
 Check that you are beautiful?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Of course not.
 I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?

38
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,839
 Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,639
 Nick!

40
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,999
 Nick! What is the matter?

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 You can tell me.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,439
 You have a toothache.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
 Then if you have a toothache,
 you must go to the den...

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 Can't I say the word 'den...'?

45
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 OK, I won't say the D- word.

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 I call him 'plumber'.

47
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,719
 OK, so when did you last see the plumber?

48
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,119
 That's not too bad, five months ago.

49
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,559
 Five years ago?

50
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:27,679
 When you were five years old?

51
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,119
 It is going to be a big job!

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 He'll need a big drill.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,039
 Come on.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 The girls must know a good plumber.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,359
 Come on.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 Do you want a sweetie?

57
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,679
 Do you want a sweetie?

58
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,879
 Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,199
 Hi, sugar plum.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,118
 Hello, snuggly puppykins.

61
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,158
 Nice clothes. New?

62
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,039
 Yeah. Thanks.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 No, he has a toothache
 so he must see the plumber.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 No, no, no, Hector.
 For a toothache, he must see the dentist.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
 I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.

67
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,479
 'Dentist'.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.

69
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,278
 So do you know a good plumber?

70
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,478
 A plumber? What for?

71
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
 Nick has toothache.

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 Well, he doesn't need a plumber.
 He needs a dentist.

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 Yes, Hector, we have
 the number of a very good plumber -  Julian.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,238
 Julian!

75
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,199
 He's so gentle.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,638
 He's so married!

77
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,519
 Hi, Julian.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Listen, we have an emergency here.

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,519
 What are the symptoms?

80
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,199
 Shaking, squealing...

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, just a toothache.

82
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,079
 You can?

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Thank you. Bye.

84
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,798
 Sorted. He'll see Nick now.

85
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,798
 OK, come on, Nick.

86
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,519
 Come on. Come on, Nick.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 Come on...

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 Come on, Nick.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,279
 Julian looked in my mouth once.

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,839
 With a mouth that big,
 I'm surprised he didn't fall in.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,078
 Hello.

93
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,119
 Who's this?

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,358
 Bernard?

95
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,278
 Hello, Bernard.

96
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,999
 Hello, Bernard.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,038
 You've been what?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,078
 Robbed?

99
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,799
 When?

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 When you were in the bath?

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,398
 All your clothes?

102
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,719
 And your keys?

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,038
 Poor Bernard.

104
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
 Listen, you must call the police, OK?

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 OK. Bye.

106
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,799
 Poor Bernard.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 It's ten o'clock!
 My sponsored silence starts now.

108
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
 He'll need a big drill.

109
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,159
 If I talk a lot now,
 then I won't have to talk later.

110
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,039
 Have you got a spot?

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 I'll call an ambulance!

112
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,678
 All your clothes?

113
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,679
 And your keys?

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,319
 Bridget Evans?

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,559
 Annie Taylor?

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
 Why not?

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,719
 You can't speak? I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,759
 You can speak.

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 One word. Three syllables.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 First syllable...

124
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,598
 Sit.

125
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,559
 Seat?

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 Chair?

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,278
 Second syllable.

128
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,719
 A? E?

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 I? I.

130
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,959
 T.

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,839
 Chair- I- T.

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
 Chair- I- T?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're being silent for charity!

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But which charity?

135
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,078
 Cow? Dog? Cat?

136
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,119
 Pig?

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

138
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
 Is this man bothering you, Annie?

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 Because if he is,
 I am going to show him some Argentinian...

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

141
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,838
 ..respect.

142
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,839
 -  And you are?
 -  Hector Romero.

143
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
 I suspect you're not English?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 He is a very good detective.

145
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,718
 And you are?

146
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,678
 Nwiff?

147
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,959
 He's just been to see the plumber.

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
 -  The plumber?
 -  Yes, he had a toothache.

149
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,159
 But you don't go to the plumber
 when you've got a toothache.

150
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,798
 -  You go to the den...
 -  Biscuit?

151
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,799
 Dentist.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery

153
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,078
 of Bernard Reynolds'...

154
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,079
 Somebody has stolen Bernard!

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 There's been a robbery
 of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

156
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
 Who would want Bernard's clothes?

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 So I'm investigating everybody in the building

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 because someone
 has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

159
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 Where were you last night?

160
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,079
 I was with Annie.

161
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 -  Annie...
 -  It's OK.

162
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:50,119
 She can't speak for chair- I- T.

163
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
 Anyway, what about Nwiff?

164
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,799
 I...

165
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Show me, Nick.

166
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
 I went to Leo's Bar.

167
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,639
 I had a beer.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 There was a beautiful girl.

169
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,639
 And a motorbike?

170
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 You were with a young woman on a motorbike?

171
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,879
 Motorbike. Registration?

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 Name of young woman?

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 He wasn't with her.

174
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,079
 The young woman
 was on television on a motorbike!

175
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
 I saw that! Very nice!

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Gee, I'm getting good at this.

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,598
 Bridget Evans?

178
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,599
 Annie Taylor?

179
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Could I have a word with you, please?

181
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
 Chair- I- T?

182
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,599
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

183
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,919
 What about Nwiff?

184
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,598
 Motorbike. Registration?

185
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,599
 Name of young woman?

186
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,878
 There you are!

187
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,679
 Hello, Mr Reynolds.

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,638
 Well, have you caught them?

189
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,679
 -  Who?
 -  The robbers.

190
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,799
 The robbers who stole my clothes.

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 Yes. My investigations are going very well.

192
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,999
 You have a cold, Bernard?

193
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,359
 You need some clothes?

194
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,519
 What a week! First, Mum went away
 to play bingo all weekend.

195
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,679
 Bingo?

196
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,959
 Two fat ladies, 88.

197
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 Clickety- click, 66.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.

199
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,398
 Bingo!

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,399
 Digestives! My favourite.

201
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,678
 You must be Miss Evans.

202
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,679
 And this is Sherlock Holmes!

203
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,519
 Bridget.

204
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 I'd like to ask you a few questions.

205
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!

206
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 What are you staring at?

207
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,759
 Nothing.

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 Is there something wrong with your top lip?

209
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,799
 No.

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Yes, there is. It's bright red.

211
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 It doesn't show, does it?

212
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,878
 No, no, no.

213
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,879
 They told me in the salon no one would notice.

214
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Thank you.

215
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,159
 I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have
 enough money, so a student did them.

216
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,559
 What, a butcher student?

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,358
 There, there. You're still very pretty.

218
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,758
 Am I? Really?

219
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,759
 Really.

220
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,199
 Where were you last night?

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,199
 -  Looking in the mirror.
 -  All night?

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,239
 Yes, all night.

223
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 How can anyone spend all night
 looking at themselves in the mirror?

224
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,039
 Bridget would.

225
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,319
 I think that someone here

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 is not telling the truth

227
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and I think that someone is you.

228
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 But I told you. I was with Annie.

229
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,159
 Annie hasn't said she was with you.

230
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,319
 That's true.

231
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,238
 She can't speak.

232
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 She is doing
 a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.

233
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?

234
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,119
 -  Yes.
 -  Where?

235
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,438
 -  Shopping.
 -  Shopping?

236
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,478
 For what?

237
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,278
 Some new clothes.

238
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,279
 These new clothes?

239
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,278
 Now, let me get this straight.

240
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,279
 You need some new clothes
 and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.

241
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 So what does that tell me?

242
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,079
 Yes, but I...

243
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Why buy new clothes
 when you can steal somebody else's?

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 Yeah!

245
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,239
 Do these look like Bernard's clothes?

246
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 They could be. My colour.

247
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,999
 Oh, no! I spoke!

248
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,599
 You! You made me speak!

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.

250
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 Bernard, it's your mother.

251
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,198
 Hello, Mum. You're back.

252
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:57,199
 How was bingo?

253
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,679
 Mum, someone stole my clothes.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,118
 OK.

255
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,999
 Right, I'm off.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,799
 Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.

257
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,878
 Bernard, what about your clothes?

258
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,719
 It's OK. She's got them.

259
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,999
 -  What?
 -  What? What?

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 She put them in the washing machine
 before she went to bingo.

261
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
 Mum!

262
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,279
 So Bernard's clothes

263
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 were in the washing machine all the time.

264
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
 Well, yes, as I suspected.

265
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.

266
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,439
 No, you won't!

267
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,638
 What?

268
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:01,639
 You owe me £120 for Pigs With No Parents.

269
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,559
 You made me speak!

270
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Well, will dollars do?

271
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,518
 Next time in Extra...

272
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,519
 The girls enter a game show.

273
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.

274
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:25,879
 And guess what Hector finds on his Jumper.

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,319
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 Nick loves babes and motorbikes

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 and Bridget loves make- up,
 mirrors and chocolate.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,759
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

9
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,239
 It's Marty!

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
 But what Sharon doesn't realise
 is we've got a camera in the bathroom.

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,518
 That's disgusting.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,519
 She must know that we can see her.

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
 I think it is quite clever.

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
 And what are Paul and Mandy doing
 in the living room?

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
 They're kissing. They're kissing.

16
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,558
 They're not kissing. They're whispering.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 What? Do you call this whispering?

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
 Let's think of another name for it.

19
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
 Paul and Mandy said they could live
 without kissing for 24 hours.

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,159
 And look, they've failed.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Paul and Mandy lose points for that.
 We caught them kissing.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,999
 See you after the break.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Can You Live Without...?
 is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.

24
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,279
 Well, I couldn't live
 without kissing Hector for 24 hours.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,758
 Why don't you try?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,759
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 -  I'm not chewing.
 -  Yes, you are. You're always chewing.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 No...

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,079
 I bet you couldn't stop
 chewing gum for 24 hours.

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,678
 Well, yes, I could.

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,679
 And, anyway, you suck your thumb.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 I do not.
 Well, only when I'm stressed.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,079
 -  I've had an idea!
 -  Oh, no!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 We could be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,599
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
 It would be easy.
 Think of the prize money.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,319
 And Marty Ross presents it.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,879
 He would come to my apartment again.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Oh, Marty.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 He's got such good taste.

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
 And this is fantastic. Original.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,078
 What happened to Marty?

43
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
 He said he needed time away from me
 to really appreciate me.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 -  So he dumped you, then.
 -  He did not!

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,479
 Anyway, Bridget,
 are you feeling persuasive?

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,039
 Of course.
 I'm always feeling persuasive.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,759
 Well, it's time to persuade Marty

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,118
 And then Marty can make it happen.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 I'll try.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,839
 Mr Ross to Studio B, please.

52
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
 -  Hello, Marty.
 -  Hello...

53
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,839
 -  Bridget!
 -  Bridget?

54
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,279
 Bridget, Eunice's researcher.
 We had dinner last month.

55
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
 That Bridget. What do you want?

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,238
 I've got something to say.

57
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,239
 Well, I'm not the father.

58
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,039
 -  No! Nothing like that.
 -  Well, what is it, then?

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
 My friends and I want to be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

60
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
 I wish I could help you, but it's not
 my decision, it's the producer's.

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,599
 Now, I must go.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 -  You can't help me? That's a shame.
 -  Yes, it is.

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

64
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,039
 Or this.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,159
 Where did you get them?

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 Don't you remember?
 I'm Eunice's researcher.

67
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,318
 I research.

68
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,319
 I wish I could help you,
 but it's not my decision,

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 it's the newspapers'.

70
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
 All right, all right.
 I'll see what I can do.

71
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,558
 It's time to persuade Marty

72
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,559
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

73
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,559
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

74
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,119
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Or this.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

77
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,079
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

78
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

79
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,279
 It's Marty!

80
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hello, darlings.

81
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 Do you want to spend
 the next 24 hours with me?

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,518
 -  Yeah!
 -  Correct answer!

83
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,519
 Yes, let's see what the people
 who live here...can live without.

84
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,279
 But it looks like
 they live without anything anyway.

85
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
 Well, let's meet the contestants.

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
 You first, pretty lady. What's your name?

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 You already know my name, Marty.

88
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
 We have a pretty joker here.

89
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,559
 Don't get smart, sweetie.

90
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 This is my show, photo or no photo.

91
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,479
 -  Bridget.
 -  Good luck, Bridget.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 -  And who do we have here?
 -  Hello.

93
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,079
 My name is Annie
 and I'm Hector's girlfriend...

94
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,159
 and I love Charley, my dog.

95
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,519
 So, which one could you live without?

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
 Enough said!

97
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 And this is Hector.

98
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 So, Hector,
 Annie loves her dog more than you.

99
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,559
 Mind you, Hector does sound
 like a dog's name, doesn't it?

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 Here, Hector! Here, boy!

101
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,438
 Don't bite!

102
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,439
 And, last of all and least of all...

103
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,959
 it's...

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Hello? Is anybody there?

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 I know, you're a fish.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 Hi. I'm Nick.

107
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,159
 Hi, Nick. And what do you like?

108
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,839
 Bananas!

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,439
 Baboons. You like baboons!

110
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 You are a baboon.
 You're a small baboon.

111
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,358
 No, it's not baboons.

112
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,118
 You like babes!

113
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,119
 Sorry, this is Nick and he likes babes.

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,958
 Well, let's get on with it.

115
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 As usual, each of these contestants
 has picked one thing

116
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 that their flatmates
 cannot live without for 24 hours.

117
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,238
 Bridget...

118
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
 You must live without chocolate...
 mirrors...and make- up.

119
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Annie, you must live without...

120
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 touching Hector, sucking your thumb...

121
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 and, most of all,
 you must live without Charley.

122
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Hector, you must live without...

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
 touching Annie and chewing gum.

124
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,318
 Nick, you must live without...

125
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
 talking about babes
 or talking about motorbikes.

126
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
 And all of you must live without

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 television, magazines and music.

128
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 24 hours of living without starts now.

129
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
 Come on, Charley.
 You're coming with me.

130
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
 Don't forget -  I'll be watching.

131
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,999
 No television!

132
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,958
 No touching.

133
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
 If you touch, we lose points
 and we won't win a big prize.

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 No make- up. What must I look like?

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 And no mirrors!

136
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 Look at that guy.
 He looks like a monkey at the zoo.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 So how will they do? Top points
 could mean a holiday in the Caribbean.

138
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,038
 But if they fail, they lose points

139
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
 and their prize holiday could be this.

140
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,159
 Of course, we might give them one or two
 temptations to make interesting television.

141
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,679
 Join me after the break.

142
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 You must live without touching Hector.

143
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 Nick, you must live
 without talking about babes

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 or talking about motorbikes.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 24 hours of living without starts now.

146
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,718
 I think it's going to rain.

147
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,719
 -  Do you?
 -  I agree.

148
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,798
 Manchester United are doing well.

149
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
 -  Are they?
 -  I agree.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 I think it's going to rain.

151
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
 Weather and football - 
 is that all you can talk about?

152
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 Well, yesterday I met this really cute b...

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Don't say it! Do not talk
 about babes or motorbikes.

154
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,079
 Careful!

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Bridget, no mirrors. You lose ten points.

156
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,439
 But it's not a mirror, it's a kettle.

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
 Don't argue!
 You lose another ten points.

158
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 Well, it's all quiet now.

159
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 What about some temptation?

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Hector, what is in your mouth?

161
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,878
 Nothing.

162
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 -  Are you chewing gum, Hector?
 -  No.

163
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
 No, he's not. He's chewing this.

164
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 Open.

165
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
 That was from the Red Sea.
 It cost a lot of money.

166
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,319
 I could kill for some chocolate.

167
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,599
 This should be fun!

168
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,719
 'Bridget.

169
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 'I love the show, love from...

170
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
 'Orlando Bloom.'

171
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 Orlando Bloom...watching me!

172
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
 I hope you didn't hear me say that.

173
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 What do I look like?
 What do I look like?

174
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,958
 What are you doing, Annie?

175
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm talking to Charley.

176
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,719
 Annie, you must live without Charley.
 You lose ten points.

177
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,199
 What?

178
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,039
 Hector...

179
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 - Don't move!
 -  What is it?

180
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,879
 It's OK, just don't move.

181
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 I'm not going anywhere.

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
 What Hector doesn't know is that
 we've put that spider on his jumper.

183
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,599
 This is wonderful TV

184
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,999
 Think, think!

185
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 One minute.

186
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,599
 That's better.

187
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Now, we'll just
 brush this little fellow off.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 Don't touch it!

189
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
 It's OK.
 I'm sure it's not poisonous.

190
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,038
 How do you know?

191
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,039
 Anyway, if you touch me,
 we will lose points.

192
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 OK.

194
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,919
 Now...stay still.

195
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,159
 Don't move!

196
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 Hang on a minute!

197
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
 Hector, this is a toy.

198
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,999
 I knew that.

199
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,119
 Hector, you were so funny.

200
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 Marty has played a trick on us.

201
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 Yeah, very funny.

202
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,798
 Who's a cross boy?

203
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
 Things are getting really hot now

204
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 and they've still got over 12 hours to go.

205
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,279
 You know, Hector,
 I really think we can do this.

206
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,159
 We can win that holiday.

207
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,758
 Hello, Annie.

208
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,118
 Bridget, what are you doing in there?

209
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,119
 I'm...just reading the electricity meter.

210
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,839
 Come here.

211
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
 Why are you wearing dark glasses?

212
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 I don't want Orlando to see me
 without make- up.

213
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,159
 Bridget! Is that chocolate?

214
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
 No.

215
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
 But they're from Orlando!

216
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 No chocolate, Bridget.
 You lose 100 points.

217
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 Nick has entered the building!

218
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Nick!

219
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 Yes! Annie and Hector touched.
 They lose 200 points.

220
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 -  What?
 -  It was an accident.

221
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,479
 And best of all, Nick,
 you can't live without motorbikes.

222
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 So you lose 500 points.

223
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,199
 No, no, no, no!

224
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 You said no talking about motorbikes,
 actually, big nose!

225
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,278
 Yeah, Marty.

226
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
 So thanks for the present.
 You can keep your holiday.

227
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,119
 What? You can't do that.

228
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Baby, fancy a ride?

229
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
 Yeah!

230
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,678
 Hector, this is for Marty.

231
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,679
 Or should I say...Martina?

232
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 So, Marty, if you want the bike,
 come and get it.

233
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 Sorry, Marty, we can live without you.

234
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
 Goodbye.

235
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,279
 And, Marty, I think your audience
 will love this picture of you.

236
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,438
 Oh, no!

237
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
 Come on, Annie.
 We have lots of catching up to do.

238
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
 Hector, catch me!

239
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,758
 Next time in Extra...

240
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie play under the mistletoe.

241
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie plays under the mistletoe.

1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 and the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector fro Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Annie are in love.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
 Bridget likes to party and party.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 And Nick will do anything
 to earn some money.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,198
 I love this time of year.

8
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 Sleigh bells, mince pies,
 presents under the tree!

9
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,519
 What? Easter?

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 No, silly! Christmas!

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 I'm going to show you what
 a traditional English Christmas is like.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 Starting with...mistletoe.

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,999
 Mistle-toe?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,958
 It's an English tradition.

15
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,959
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
 But I am not under any mistletoe.

17
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,919
 You are now.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,159
 Oh, you poor things!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,398
 You're stuck together again.

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,399
 Don't worry, I can help!

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,798
 There, panic over!

22
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,839
 - Right, I'm off.
 - What?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,918
 Another television party?

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,919
 Not a party, three more parties.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,118
 And that's just tonight.

26
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,119
 But you've been to a Christmas
 party every night for two weeks.

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,159
 I know.
 It's so difficult being so popular.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First, there's a champagne party
 at the Savoy,

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 then at nine o'clock
 I'll get a taxi to the Ritz

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,878
 and get changed on the way...

31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,599
 What? In the taxi?

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,439
 Naturally.

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 And then at 1 1 :30
 I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.

34
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,998
 Annabel - who is she?

35
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,999
 Annabel's - the night club.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 Will you change your clothes
 in the taxi again?

37
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,519
 And there I hope
 I Will meet a young, handsome man.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 An early Christmas present!

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 I hate Christmas!

40
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,079
 Did you have a bad day
 at the grotto, dear?

41
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,759
 - Nick, is that snow?
 - No.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,398
 Well, what,s that on your beard then?

43
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,399
 I was holding this baby...

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 when suddenly...

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
 - Christmas!
 - But children Love Christmas.

46
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,358
 - Is the money good?
 - Yeah.

47
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,399
 Well, stop complaining then!

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Hector and I are going to have
 a lovely Christmas, aren't we?

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 Christmas is all about
 parties and presents!

50
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,079
 So, Bridget, have you got your
 Christmas stocking ready?

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
 She's taking her stockings off
 in the taxi!

52
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,959
 Don't wait up.

53
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,518
 What is a Christmas stocking?

54
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,519
 On Christmas Eve,
 you hang up your Christmas stocking

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes
 and fills it up with presents!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 Who put that sleigh there?

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 My sleigh! I forgot!

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Mind my leq.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 Right, right...
 Whoa! Not too fast!

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,719
 I feel terrible!

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Poor Bridget. Are you in pain?
 - No.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,519
 But what about the parties?
 I can,t go like this!

63
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,599
 I could take you dancing!

64
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,759
 Christmas is cancelled!

65
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,719
 - Is that it?
 - Yeah, crackers are great!

66
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,359
 So, what else
 do you have at Christmas?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Mince pies. How do you make them?

69
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,559
 It's just pastry and mincemeat.

70
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,718
 - Mincemeat?
 - Yeah, it's traditional

71
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,719
 It's sultanas, raisins and spices.
 It's mince...

72
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,079
 - Meat.
 - Yeah.

73
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,159
 Listen to this.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 What do you get
 if you cross a chicken with a clock?

75
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,719
 - I don't know.
 - An alarm cluck!

76
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,319
 An alarm cluck!

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 I don't get it.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 An alarm cluck!

79
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,999
 One a cluck, two a cluck...

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,079
 A clock?

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,398
 Mistle-toe?

82
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,319
 It's an English tradition.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 I was holding this baby...
 when suddenly...

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 It's so difficult being so popular.

86
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,639
 My sleigh! I forgot!

87
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,158
 Mince pies!

88
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,999
 First, the pastry!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And now the minced meat
 from the best butcher!

90
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,439
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

91
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Well, I've finished
 all my Christmas shopping.

92
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,198
 Oh, madam!

93
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,199
 Refreshment? Mince pie?

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,958
 I followed the re-ceep.

96
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,879
 - Pee.
 - Mince pee?

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,478
 No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.

98
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,479
 Re-ci-pe.

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,918
 Something wrong?

101
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
 Delicious...Delicious.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 You know, Hector,
 Christmas is all about sharing.

103
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,279
 Would you like some, Charley?

104
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,439
 It's Saint Nicholas!

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,878
 What happened to your beard?

106
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,879
 One Christmas candle,
 one small child...

107
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,759
 Mince pies, yummy!

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 With best mince from the best butcher.

109
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 Hector. What did you put in the pies?

110
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,199
 Minced meat - from the best butcher.

111
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,598
 This is mincemeat.

112
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,599
 This is minced meat.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,958
 Isn't it the same thing?

114
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,959
 - Not quite.
 - Delicious!

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,278
 I've got an idea!

116
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 Let's make this a special Christmas,
 just for Bridget.

117
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 Night-night.

118
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,999
 Hey, Bridget.

119
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,239
 - Do you want to come carol singing?
 - Who is Carol?

120
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,439
 Carols are Christmas songs.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 You knock on people's doors
 and sing to them for money.

122
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,799
 - Let's do it!
 - For charity!

123
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 For poor little children.

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Some children have no Christmas.

125
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,599
 Just like me.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And your job as Santa Claus
 is so important.

127
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,959
 You help children
 to believe in Christmas!

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.

129
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,958
 My job is important!

130
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
 I help children to believe!

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,039
 Right, let's go!

132
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,638
 And that Will make you happy?

134
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,639
 Here, have a mince pie.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 All right.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Away in a manger...

137
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 Dog in a manger more like! Good night!

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 Silent night...

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
 I wish you were - all night!

140
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
 We Three Kings of Orient are

141
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,518
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

142
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,158
 Get Iost!

143
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,399
 Merrlly on high...

144
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,159
 Get 'em, Gnasher!

145
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 Come all ye faithful

146
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,479
 Joyful and tri...

147
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,879
 Hi, Annie. I like the tree.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Thank you. It's nearly finished.

149
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 Please, use these. My decorations.

150
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,558
 Oh, sweet, Hector.

151
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,559
 - Are they from Argentina?
 - No.

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 Oxford Street.

153
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 - Aren't they great?
 - Great.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Hi, Nick.
 How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Great! Such nice children.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 One of them
 let me play with his binoculars!

157
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,558
 Really?

158
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,159
 And I've just finished
 my Christmas shopping.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 - But the shops are shut now.
 - No.

160
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,359
 The petrol station was open.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,958
 Look I've bought my mum this.

162
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,279
 A map of Watford.

163
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 - But your mum doesn't live in Watford.
 - I know.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,078
 She might go there one day, though.

165
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,838
 I bought shampoo for my sister.

166
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,438
 Car shampoo.

167
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,439
 Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.

168
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 I like the tree...but I Love these!

169
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,998
 I've got some too.

170
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,999
 It was the Iast day of the grotto today,
 so they were throwing these away.

171
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Can you believe it!

172
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,319
 No!

173
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,759
 Perfect.

174
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.

175
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,319
 Why?

176
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties,
 let's have a party here!

177
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,839
 - When?
 - Oh, I don't know.

178
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 In about 15 minutes?

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 Look at the Christmas tree!

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I know. It makes me want to cry too.

181
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
 What's the point of having Christmas
 if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now Christmas just makes me cry!

183
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,118
 Bridget, cheer up.

184
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

185
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,559
 Have you got your stocking?

186
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 Yes.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,519
 And I've got mine!

188
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 What are you hoping for? A motorbike?

189
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,079
 Yes! Why not?

190
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 The only thing
 that Will make this Christmas worse

191
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,799
 is if you invited all my friends round
 for a surprise party to cheer me up.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Surprise!

193
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 And now the minced meat,
 from the best butcher!

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

195
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,639
 We Three Kings of Orient are

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,959
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

197
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 Good night!

198
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,279
 Joyful and tri...

199
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 Surprise!

200
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,359
 Hang on, I,m coming!

201
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 - Merry Christmas!
 - Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.

202
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 I'm sorry,
 we had a little party Iast night.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm here for dinner.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,998
 Isn't it a bit early?

205
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,999
 Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 - Bernard, where's your mother?
 - At church.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Well, I'll just go and get dressed.

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 To Bernard, Love from Annie.

209
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,198
 Sherry. Thanks, Annie.

210
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,638
 Nearly finished this one.

211
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,639
 To Bridget, Love from Annie.

212
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,479
 A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!

213
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label.
 It was meant for Charley.

214
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,479
 Is she sure it was meant for Charley?

215
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 To Bridget, from Hector.

216
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,119
 Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,199
 What To Wear At Christmas Parties.

218
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,999
 I bought it before you...

219
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,239
 I've got a little something for you, Nick.

220
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,519
 Gorilla -
 because you are the original man.

221
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,838
 It smells like a gorilla.

222
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,839
 Well, you should know.

223
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,599
 I wonder what this could be.

224
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,759
 Merry Christmas, sugar plum.

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 One heart, forever.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 This Will stop it!

228
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
 Bridget, nothing Will stop
 my Love for Hector.

229
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,119
 Well...

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I just called to say Merry Christmas!

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Hector.

232
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,879
 Bridget, what has happened to you?

233
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,079
 - I had an accident.
 - Oh, what a pity!

234
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,119
 You've missed some fabulous parties -

235
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,639
 especially at the Beckhams'.

236
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Elton John is a very naughty boy!

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Still, never mind,
 there is always next year.

238
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,438
 OK, must dash.

239
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,318
 Off to a top restaurant for lunch.

240
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,639
 - Eunice?
 - Yes?

241
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?

242
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,679
 I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.

243
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,039
 It's true, there is a Santa!

244
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 And she's a woman! Wait for me!

245
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 I want to tell you
 what I really want for Christmas!

246
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,879
 - Can you smell something?
 - Yeah.

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Is something burning?

248
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
 I forgot - the turkey!

249
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 Water, water! We need water!

250
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,439
 Not on me! On the turkey!

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 Move! Move!

252
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 There. The fire is out.

253
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,879
 Anyone for turkey?!

254
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,998
 Shall we just have pudding?

255
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,999
 No mince pies, thanks.

256
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,958
 I have another surprise for you.

257
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,959
 Another English Christmas tradition.

258
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,479
 Chocolate log. One slice or two?

259
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,799
 Next time in Extra...

260
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,559
 Nick wants to join the SAS,

261
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 Bridget and Annie
 train the boys for action

262
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 and why is Hector home so late?

263
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

264
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,798
 Hector works for Channel 9.

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,399
 Annie is getting jealous.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Bridget has seen it all before.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 And Nick just wants to have fun.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,118
 Hello, Nick. Have you lost a button?

9
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,119
 Hi, Bridget.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
 I'm just...

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,079
 practising.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,198
 Practising what?

13
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,199
 I am going to join the SAS.

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,159
 The Special Air Service?

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 -  Yeah.
 -  You?

16
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,319
 What's so funny?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 Nick, the SAS is for tough guys,

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,959
 real men who are fit.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
 They're highly trained.

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 I was in the Scouts.

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
 You...

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 were in the Scouts?

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,359
 Annie.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 Nick's going to join the SAS.

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
 That's wonderful, Nick.
 Don't you need special training?

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 It's OK, he was in the Scouts.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,718
 Hello.

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,719
 Here in the National Camping Exhibition...

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,918
 There's Hector.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 ..it is all tents, tents, tents.

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 In every shape, size and colour.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,558
 And Eunice.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,559
 -  And we will be showing you the best...
 -  And the worst of camping.

34
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,958
 So, stick around.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,879
 Back to studio.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags,
 Hector?

38
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,919
 Calm down, Annie, it's only a television report.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 I know but, well,
 he's been working with Eunice a lot recently.

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,758
 And?

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
 And, well, I'm just worried that he...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,198
 well, that she...

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,998
 You know.

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,999
 Annie, don't be silly.
 You've got nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
 Although...

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 Hector is a good- looking man.

47
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,119
 Yep, and she's a good- looking woman.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
 Incoming, Broad Sword calling Danny Boy,

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 Broad Sword calling Danny Boy...

50
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,678
 I was watching that.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,278
 Not any more. Go on, it's late.

52
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
 Back to your own tent.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,159
 What's so funny?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,438
 You.

55
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,278
 A Scout.

56
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,158
 Yeah, so?

57
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,159
 I can just imagine.

58
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,039
 Trying to light fires.

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
 Jessop, you cheat.

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 Helping old ladies across the road.

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
 Tying knots.

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 -  What was that?
 -  I didn't hear anything.

63
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,638
 Hello, Hector.

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
 Good evening, Annie.

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,839
 Don't you mean 'good morning'?

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,678
 Where have you been?

67
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,679
 You know, for a couple of beers.

68
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,878
 Who with?

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,879
 With the lads.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 So when did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 I forgot, Eunice was there too.

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 So what did you talk about?

73
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,759
 Tents.

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,118
 Tents?

75
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,119
 You talked about tents all night?

76
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,039
 Where? In her tent?

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,999
 Or yours?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Annie. Annie...

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 I am going to join the SAS.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
 I was in the Scouts.

81
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
 Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags
 now, Hector?

82
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Where have you been?

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 When did the lads start wearing
 ladies' perfume?

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,119
 Yes! I've got it!

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,398
 It was my turn for the toy.

86
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 No, you've got the Incredible Hulk.

87
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,599
 So I get two turns.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 -  Hey, Nick.
 -  Yeah?

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 What do you think of Eunice?

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,118
 Well, she isn't an English rose.

91
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,119
 No, I don't think she is a flower.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
 No, it's a saying.

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
 An English rose -  a sweet, pretty girl.

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,318
 -  Like Annie.
 -  No.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,319
 Eunice is not a sweet, pretty girl.

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 No. Eunice is more...

97
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
 What is that plant that grows all over walls
 in England?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,758
 Honeysuckle.

99
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,759
 Wallflower.

100
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
 -  Ivy?
 -  Yeah, ivy.

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 Eunice is more like English ivy.

102
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,519
 -  What do you mean?
 -  Well, she...

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
 Likes dancing?

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,598
 No, she...

105
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,599
 She's all over you?

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
 Do you like it?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 I see trouble ahead.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 What's so funny?

109
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,118
 Come on.

110
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,119
 Share the joke.

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
 It's Hector.

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Hector came home late last night, is that it?

113
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,959
 He was out with Eunice.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,158
 Don't worry about Eunice.

115
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,159
 She likes flirting, that's all.

116
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,759
 This will cheer you up.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 Look what I found.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,519
 It's pictures of us when we were Brownies.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 -  And you're wearing the Brownie uniform.
 -  It still fits.

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
 Look at all your badges.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 What was the Brownie law?

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 A Brownie Guide thinks of others
 before herself...

123
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 And does a good turn every day.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,958
 Remember the Brownie law, Annie.

125
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,999
 OK.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,918
 OK.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
 Hello, Hector. How are you?

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,879
 Fine.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,999
 Did you have a good night's sleep?

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,599
 What was left of it.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 Dib- dib, dob- dob.

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,519
 What's all this, then?

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 It is the Brownie salute.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,879
 That's not a salute.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 This is a salute.

136
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
 -  What do you think, Hector?
 -  Well, both salutes are nice.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,879
 -  Brownies.
 -  Or Scouts.

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,078
 -  Brownies.
 -  Scouts.

139
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,158
 What are you talking about?

140
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
 What are Brownies? Biscuits?

141
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 When Bridget and I were little girls,
 we were Brownies.

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,119
 We went camping, we sang songs.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,959
 We were given badges for good work.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,878
 Brownies are for girls.

145
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,879
 In the Scouts we survived.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 It was just like being in the SAS, wasn't it, Nick?

147
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,558
 Yeah.

148
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,719
 So what are all those badges for?

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,678
 This one is for first aid.

150
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,679
 And what is second aid or third aid?

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 First aid is for helping people who are hurt.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
 How hurt?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,839
 Like if they can't breathe.

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,078
 Shall I demonstrate, Bridget?

155
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,079
 Go ahead, Annie.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Lie down, please, Hector.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
 Now, this is called the kiss of life.

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,358
 Sounds good.

159
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,359
 It means I breathe into your mouth.

160
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
 And if you still can't breathe, I do this.

161
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
 Well, that is...

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 And I keep doing this until you can breathe.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,638
 Are you breathing yet?

164
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
 Yes, yes, yes, I can breathe.

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
 And that is my good turn for the day.

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,278
 Now, Nick,

167
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
 bites and stings.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,599
 No, thanks.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,439
 Of course, when I was in the Scouts,

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,358
 I went camping.

171
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,918
 So did we.

172
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,919
 Ah, but this was proper camping, survival.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,198
 What? Like the SAS?

174
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
 We had to live off the land.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
 What? No tins of baked beans?

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 No.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,039
 So could you do a survival test?

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,119
 Yeah, no problem.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,319
 Yeah.

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
 Right, then.

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,638
 We will give you a survival test.

182
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,639
 Great.

183
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,878
 What is a survival test?

184
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,358
 You'll see.

185
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 Just be prepared.

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,279
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 -  Certainly am.
 -  OK. Test number one.

188
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
 The jungle is full of horrible things
 that creep and crawl.

189
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,959
 And some that wriggle everywhere.

190
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,638
 Especially...

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
 worms!

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,878
 OK.

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,879
 Test number two.

194
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,479
 Food.

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 You have run out of food,

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 so you have to eat whatever you can find.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 Open very wide, please.

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 Ready?

199
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,119
 Beetles!

200
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,398
 OK.

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,158
 Test number three.

202
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,159
 Pain.

203
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,558
 I haven't touched you yet.

204
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 I'm sorry, boys,
 you have failed the survival test.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,798
 But in the jungle

206
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,198
 it is going to be different.

207
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,199
 Yeah, we were just pretending.
 It wasn't real.

208
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
 What? Like real camping?

209
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,719
 -  Why don't we do it?
 -  Do what?

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
 -  Let's go camping.
 -  We haven't got a tent.

211
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 Well, Hector can get us a tent
 from the National Camping Exhibition.

212
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,158
 Well, isn't tomorrow
 the last day of the exhibition?

213
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,318
 Yeah.

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,319
 And you and Eunice will be doing another report.

215
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,158
 Yeah.

216
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
 Well, then, you can buy a tent
 and come home early.

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,878
 You'll miss your drinks after work.

218
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,879
 Shame.

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
 What do you think of Eunice?

220
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,359
 I see trouble ahead.

221
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
 Lie down, please, Hector.

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
 That's not a salute.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is a salute.

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,518
 Ready for your survival test, boys?

225
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
 Certainly am.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Worms.

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 Beetles!

228
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,439
 Let's go camping.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,199
 In the jungle it is going to be different.

230
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,319
 You will wake Annie.

231
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,519
 Hey, I have an idea.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 I must show you to Annie.

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
 You know, I have a better idea.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,158
 Come, come.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
 Come. You too, come, come.

236
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
 Nick.

237
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,159
 Nick, wake up.

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
 No more beetles!

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,358
 -  Hector.
 -  Nick.

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,118
 -  What's going on?
 -  I've got it.

241
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,719
 -  Got what?
 -  The tent.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 That's nice.

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,799
 -  Come on, let's put it up.
 -  What?

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,039
 The tent.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,719
 Hector.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,079
 -  Have you seen the time?
 -  No.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,918
 It's three o'clock in the morning!

248
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
 -  Is it?
 -  Yeah.

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,878
 Really?

250
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,879
 Wait a minute.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,439
 Where have you been?

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,438
 For a couple of beers.

253
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,879
 And a dance.

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 What's that on your collar?

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,438
 Paint.

256
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,439
 Pink paint. That's nice.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,158
 When Annie wakes up,

258
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,638
 she is going to be cross with me.

259
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,118
 If she sees that on your collar, she will be.

260
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,238
 Have you been dancing with Eunice?

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,638
 Yes.

262
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,038
 You are dead.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
 But...when Annie sees that I bought the tent...

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,918
 she is going to forgive me.

265
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
 At three o'clock in the morning?

266
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,199
 Late- night shopping.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
 It is OK, Charley, it is me, Hector.

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,358
 Where shall we put it?

269
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,479
 Here.

270
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,638
 Here.

271
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,598
 In the middle.

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
 Guy ropes.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,318
 What?

274
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,599
 -  Guy Ropes, who is he?
 -  No.

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,078
 Guy ropes.

276
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,079
 Ropes called guy ropes.

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 Somewhere here.

278
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,438
 -  Look.
 -  That's them.

279
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
 Tie them to the furniture.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,638
 There. That is it.

281
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
 Right, let's go to bed.

282
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,518
 What? What's this?

283
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,798
 Who put that there?

284
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Hi, Annie. I've bought you a tent.

285
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,118
 What is going on?

286
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,119
 Well, do you like your tent?

287
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,159
 Anyone for camping?

288
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,278
 It's so cold.

289
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,199
 I'll warm you up.

290
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,358
 Did somebody say something?

291
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,959
 I want a hot drink.

292
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,518
 We can't even make a fire.

293
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,519
 And there's no water left.

294
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,359
 How long have we been here?

295
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 It feels like ages.

296
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,999
 It's so creepy.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Yeah. Very creepy.

298
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,719
 Are you tired, Hector?
 Did you have another late night with Eunice?

299
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,879
 So who's going to go outside
 and get us some water?

300
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,238
 Well, I won't.

301
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,239
 Well, I won't either.

302
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,638
 All right, I'll go,

303
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,639
 but if I'm not back in ten minutes,
 you can have my Action Man collection.

304
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off you go.

305
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,919
 Morning, Nick, dear.

306
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
 Thought you and your friends
 would like a nice cup of tea.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,999
 Thanks, Mum.

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Thanks, Mrs Jessop.

309
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,718
 Next time in Extra...

310
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,518
 Bridget gets a new job.

311
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,519
 Hector receives a phone call from Lola.

312
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,479
 And Annie is looking for trouble.

313
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,438
 It's not Eunice. It's not Debbie.

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

315
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:30,398
 Could it be Lola?

316
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,399
 Could it be Lola?

1
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,239
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
 They have a visitor from Argentina

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 who can't speak English very well,

4
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,478
 who has no style,

5
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,878
 and who can't do the shopping.

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,879
 But he is very, very handsome.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,079
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 Dear dream date.

9
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,919
 My name is Annie!

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 I'm 19 and I love animals,

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,559
 and...

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
 and...

13
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:35,679
 and I love chocolate.

14
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,719
 Chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake,

15
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,559
 boxes of chocolate, chocolate mousse...

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,958
 -  What are you doing, Annie?
 -  Nothing!

17
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,319
 What's this?

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,320
 'Dream date, make my dream come true!'

19
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,999
 -  Oh, how did that get there?
 -  How sweet!

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,479
 Let's go. Look left.

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,798
 Right. One, two, three, four, left.

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
 -  Hector!
 -  And right.

23
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
 -  Hector.
 -  Oh, hi, Bridget.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,279
 -  And up...
 -  And up!

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,519
 And up...and down...

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 Oh, well, keep going, Hector.

27
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,279
 Oh, I see Hector found
 Cindy's 101 Top Exercises, then.

28
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,718
 Yes!

29
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,038
 Oh, good try, Hector.

30
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,039
 But Cindy is so old- fashioned,
 I can teach Hector how to exercise!

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,239
 Exercise with Cindy, no.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,558
 Exercise with Bridget, yes!

33
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,559
 -  But...!
 -  It's OK, I can do it!

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 Music, please, Annie.

35
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,558
 Follow me.

36
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,439
 Arms up, touch your toes,

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,079
 stand straight and...

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,078
 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

39
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,518
 More energy, please!

40
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,519
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,240
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

42
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,319
 OK, faster still!

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,999
 Left leg up! Left leg up!

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,918
 Left leg up!

45
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,919
 -  Oh, my leg hurts!
 -  Come on, keep up!

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,680
 Come on, faster! Come on!

47
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,079
 Come on! Come on!

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
 Faster!

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,598
 Oh, hi, Nick.

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,599
 -  We're exercising.
 -  I can see.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
 Phew, OK. Let's get a drink!

52
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,039
 Oh, I must check my emails.

53
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,559
 -  Would you like some water, Hector?
 -  Oh, no. No, after you.

54
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,959
 -  No, you first.
 -  Oh, no, no, no. Ladies first.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,599
 -  No, no, you first.
 -  No, you first.

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,798
 Oh, give it to me!

57
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,799
 Oh, goody! Three messages.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,639
 -  Oh, dear.
 -  What's wrong?

59
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,518
 Annie's been on the Internet - again!

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,759
 The Internet?

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,760
 -  To find a boyfriend!
 -  Oh, let's see!

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,798
 -  Oh, no. Don't look.
 -  Oh, come on, Annie!

63
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,799
 Oh, all right, then.

64
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,999
 'Annie baby! Rocky the tennis star here!

65
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
 'I am the racket - will you be my ball?'

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,238
 OK, number two.

67
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,238
 Mmm.

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,239
 Erm... 'Dear Annie! I love animals too.'

69
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,359
 Mmm.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 'They are so beautiful in their glass boxes.'

71
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,679
 'Come and see them.
 Tony Green (Taxidermist).'

72
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,039
 A taxidermist! Ooh, how horrible!

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,519
 Oh, Charley! Here, boy!

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,479
 It's OK, Charley.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Annie, what is a taxidermist?

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 Erm, well, it's...

77
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,719
 It's a...

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 Ah... Oh, never mind.

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,678
 -  Third time lucky.
 -  Hope so.

80
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,679
 Hmm. 'Annie, can you cook like my mother?

81
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
 'Do you like trains? Can you meet me today?

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,278
 'Giles Smith (aged 24)

83
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,279
 'P.S. Mummy says I must be home
 before 5.00 pm.'

84
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,078
 -  Oh, dear!
 -  Oh!

85
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
 I'll never get a boyfriend!

86
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,239
 -  Bridget always has a boyfriend.
 -  Has she?

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,559
 Annie, look, it's not what you write,

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,558
 it's...it's how you write it.

89
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,038
 Huh?

90
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,039
 I bet I could get a girlfriend on the Internet,
 no problem.

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,559
 Well, yes, Nick, you could!

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
 I bet you could not!

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 I could!

94
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,558
 OK...

95
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,559
 What would you write?

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,759
 I'm six foot tall.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,278
 Five foot eleven.

98
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,279
 I have blonde hair.

99
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,599
 -  Mousy brown.
 -  I love animals.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,199
 -  Ha!
 -  And fast cars, and beautiful women.

101
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,198
 -  I would write to you!
 -  Would you?

102
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,199
 Oh, come on, Annie!

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 -  Let's go to the gym.
 -  Oh, Bridget, no! Not more exercise!

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,999
 See you later, boys.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Oh, and er, Hector,
 would you do my washing for me?

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,198
 Washing? OK.

107
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,398
 No problem.

108
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,399
 Oh, and Nick?
 Will you spray my plant for me, please?

109
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,439
 -  The spray is in the bathroom.
 -  No problem.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 -  Nick?
 -  Uh- huh?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 What is a taxidermist?

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 Oh. Well...

113
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,479
 Well, it's...

114
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,159
 Never mind.

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 Chrissy!

116
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,558
 Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

117
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,559
 More energy, please!

118
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 -  My leg hurts!
 -  Come on, keep up!

119
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,359
 Nadia.

120
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,439
 Oh, Charley! Here, boy!

121
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,718
 -  Oh, dear!
 -  Oh!

122
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,719
 I'll never get a boyfriend.

123
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,199
 Dan!

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
 I bet I could get a girlfriend on the Internet,
 no problem.

125
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,879
 Finding girlfriends on the Internet
 is so easy.

126
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,759
 OK, Hector!

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,638
 Question one.

128
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,518
 How do guys get girlfriends?

129
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,519
 -  Girlfriends?
 -  Yeah!

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 -  Girlfriends.
 -  Oh! Oh, no girlfriends, me.

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,759
 -  Never.
 -  What?

132
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 Never? No girl...no girlfriends?

133
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,199
 Wow! Man!

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
 -  You, Nick, you have had girlfriends?
 -  Yeah, loads!

135
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,719
 -  Ten?
 -  Ten? Ha!

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,359
 Hundreds!

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
 -  Wow!
 -  So I know what girls like.

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 They like fast cars,

139
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,599
 they like money,

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,639
 they like dancing.

141
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
 Oh, I love dancing!

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,918
 Like this!

143
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,919
 No, dancing like this!

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,718
 Huh? Yeah.

145
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,719
 Hector, leave it to me.

146
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,879
 Leave it to me, my friend, I have a plan!

147
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,598
 Oh, Hector, Annie's plant.

148
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,959
 Her garden spray is in the bathroom.

149
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
 Oh.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,719
 Ho- ho!

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 Garden...gar- den... Erm...

152
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,959
 Spray, garden spray.

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,158
 'Garden Romance'.

154
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,159
 Garden... good!

155
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,399
 Hmm! Perfect!

156
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
 Perfect!

157
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,238
 Cold, hot...

158
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,398
 very hot.

159
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,518
 -  Er, Nick.
 -  Uh- huh?

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,519
 Bridget's cold or hot?

161
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,638
 Ha, very hot!

162
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,639
 Ah.

163
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,119
 Perfect!

164
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
 Perfect, ha!

165
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,799
 Hector, we'll get lots of girlfriends now!

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,599
 -  Aha!
 -  From now on

167
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 it'll be girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,839
 -  Ha- ha!
 -  Yo!

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,039
 -  Ha- hey!
 -  Whoo!

170
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 Oh, you really must change your aftershave!

171
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,719
 Oh, excuse me.

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 Come on, let's go out and celebrate.

173
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,519
 What's that smell?

174
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 It smells like a perfumery.

175
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,239
 Oh, my plant!

176
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,678
 Oh, empty!

177
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,679
 Oh, my poor plant! I don't believe it!

178
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,119
 My perfume, I don't believe it!

179
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,358
 Nick!

180
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,359
 Oh, good, the washing's done.

181
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,559
 What's the problem?

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 This is the problem!

183
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
 Hector!

184
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,479
 -  Wow!
 -  What is it now?

185
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
 We have six hundred
 and thirty- three messages!

186
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,238
 Let's see.

187
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,839
 OK, one moment.

188
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,799
 'Hector! Nick! Yes! We are gorgeous!

189
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 'Yes! We like dancing!
 And yes! We like millionaires!

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,278
 'Fifi and Sara.'

191
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,279
 Chloe, Sadie, Louise, Gerri...

192
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,959
 These messages are all for Hector and Nick
 and they're all from girls!

193
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,439
 I smell a rat!

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 Hmm! And I think I know who is responsible!

195
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,719
 Oh, Bridget!

196
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 Look at this!
 'Are you a gorgeous babe?

197
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,958
 'Do you have a gorgeous friend?

198
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,878
 'Do you like fast cars and dancing all night?

199
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,759
 'Do you like millionaires?

200
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,238
 'Then you will love us - 

201
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,239
 'we are Hector and Nick - 
 the Romero brothers.'

202
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,758
 What?

203
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,759
 'See attached photo.'

204
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 Ha, cheats, they glued their photo on this car!

205
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,119
 Ha, what a joke!

206
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
 What, that's how they received six hundred
 and thirty- three messages from girls.

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 But they don't know they received six hundred
 and thirty- three messages, do they?

208
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,279
 No, they don't now.

209
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,280
 Let's go to the cybercafe.

210
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,359
 I have a plan.

211
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
 The poor computer. How many messages?

212
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,198
 One hundred!

213
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,319
 Two hundred!

214
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,919
 -  Oh.
 -  How many?

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,798
 -  Er, one.
 -  Good.

216
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,799
 -  One hundred!
 -  No, no, no, just one message.

217
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,278
 Huh?

218
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,438
 Erm...

219
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,198
 'Hector and Nick!

220
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,199
 'We are dancers in a West End musical.'

221
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,199
 Dancers, you mean...

222
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,479
 -  Dancers?
 -  Yeah, sort of.

223
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,559
 Erm... 'When we finish the show, shall we
 meet at your apartment at 10pm?

224
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,358
 'Is that OK?

225
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,359
 'Cuddles and Bubbles, kiss, kiss, kiss.

226
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,438
 'P.S. What is your address?'

227
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,398
 Wow! They sound gorgeous!

228
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,638
 Uh?

229
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,598
 Er... Ah!

230
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,478
 Ta- da!

231
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,479
 Cuddles and Bubbles...

232
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,999
 are coming here tonight

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 when they finish the show...

234
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
 at...

235
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,518
 ten o'clock!

236
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,519
 Look, seven o'clock, eight, nine, ten o'clock!

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Wait a minute! It's seven o'clock!

238
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,919
 That's just three hours!

239
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
 What am I going to wear?
 What are you going to wear?

240
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 But Nick, what about Bridget and Annie?

241
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,838
 Aha!

242
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,358
 It's not a problem!

243
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,359
 Ah- ha- ha! Yes!

244
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,319
 Nadia.

245
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 Oh, my plant!

246
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 What's the problem?

247
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 This is the problem!

248
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,599
 Hector!

249
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,159
 Cuddles and Bubbles...

250
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,279
 are coming here tonight.

251
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 So, Nick, what should I say?

252
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,759
 -  It's easy. Relax.
 -  Yeah, but you have had a hundred girlfriends.

253
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,399
 Yeah, well, when I said a hundred,
 it's actually fewer.

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,039
 Er...fifty?

255
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,318
 No.

256
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,039
 -  Forty?
 -  No.

257
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,039
 -  Thirty?
 -  No.

258
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,998
 -  Twenty?
 -  No.

259
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,919
 -  Ten?
 -  No.

260
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,478
 Five?

261
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,639
 Four?

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,958
 Three?

263
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,239
 Two?

264
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,998
 One?

265
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,999
 None?

266
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,838
 OK.

267
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
 It's OK.

268
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,119
 Hi.

269
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,319
 -  Hi!
 -  Hello, it's us.

270
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,399
 Come on up.

271
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,879
 Ooh!

272
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 So Nick, what do I say?

273
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
 OK, we need a script.

274
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,518
 Try this.

275
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,519
 Your eyes are blue, like the ocean.

276
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 Your ears are blue, like the ocean.

277
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,479
 No! Eyes, ears, ears, eyes.

278
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
 Oh, oh, oh, OK, OK. Er...

279
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
 Your eyes are blue, like the ocean.

280
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,799
 Good!

281
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 You smell of sweet...

282
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,758
 You smell of sweat...

283
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,118
 No! No...

284
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,679
 Sweet...not sweat!

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,359
 Oh, OK, OK.

286
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 OK, your hair is so soft.

287
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,119
 -  Thank you, Nick.
 -  No!

288
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
 No, her hair, her hair!

289
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,399
 Oh, her hair!

290
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,278
 Oh, oh!

291
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,279
 OK, OK.

292
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
 -  Ready?
 -  Ready.

293
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,959
 Good luck!

294
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 Oh! Cuddles and Bubbles.

295
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 But we thought you were dancers.

296
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,038
 Oh, you are dancers.

297
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,798
 Dancing...dogs!

298
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,158
 In...Woof, The Musical.

299
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,078
 Erm, come in.

300
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,079
 Come in.

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 Er, please, sit down.

302
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,279
 Sit!

303
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680
 Stick to the script.

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You smell so sweet.

305
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,319
 Your ears are...blue, like the ocean.

306
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,158
 Psst.

307
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,998
 -  Eyes, eyes!
 -  Oh!

308
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,959
 Eyes!

309
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
 Are you a millionaire?

310
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,839
 Psst, psst!

311
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 Am I a millionaire?

312
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,759
 Are you a millionaire?

313
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 Are you a millionaire?

314
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 We are millionaires!

315
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
 Good, good.

316
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
 Well, you can pay for these, then!

317
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 If you please!

318
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,679
 Your faces!

319
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680
 -  We are the dancers.
 -  From the cybercafe!

320
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 -  So you are millionaires, eh?
 -  Oh, what a trick to get girlfriends!

321
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,718
 Millionaires, very funny!

322
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,358
 With fast cars!

323
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,119
 Good trick, eh?

324
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,120
 But that is my car!

325
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,119
 You smell so sweet!

326
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,279
 And you do have beautiful eyes!

327
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,359
 Or is it ears?

328
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,559
 -  It's the landlady!
 -  I'm off!

329
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,118
 Quick! Hide, Hector! Erm, er...

330
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,119
 In the bedroom!

331
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,959
 Er, Bridget?

332
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,558
 Yes.

333
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,559
 Tell me.

334
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,599
 What is a taxidermist?

335
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,799
 Oh!

336
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,839
 Next time in Extra...

337
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,798
 Hector wants to get a job.

338
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,799
 Bridget and Annie have a surprise.

339
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,359
 And guess who's coming to dinner.

340
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,559
 And guess who's coming to dinner.

341
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 And guess who's coming to dinner.

1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,600
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,639
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,478
 Hector and Annie were in love,

4
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,479
 but now things are not so good.

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,079
 Bridget has given up on love,

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 And Nick -  well, his mum loves him!

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra!

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,438
 Hector.

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,439
 -  Yes?
 -  Please could you pass the salt?

10
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,079
 Yes.

11
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,399
 Hector.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,638
 Yes?

13
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,639
 Please could you pass the pepper?

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 Of course.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,278
 Hector.

16
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,279
 Let me guess.
 Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 Actually, I was going to say we should talk.

18
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,639
 So, now you want to talk to me!

19
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,399
 It's only been a week!

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 -  I was hurt!
 -  Well, you hurt me too.

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,959
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!
 -  I didn't go out with Eunice!

22
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,119
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,478
 There were other people there, too.

24
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,479
 -  Who?
 -  People who work on the programme.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 You mean other women
 who work on the programme.

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,478
 Yes, and men -  why not, huh?

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,519
 I knew it!

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,079
 So, who is she?

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,758
 -  Who?
 -  The other woman.

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,239
 There is no other woman!

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 Huh!

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 Annie, listen.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,679
 Excuse me.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 Hello. Hi, Debbie.

35
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,119
 How are you? Good.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.

37
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,958
 Bye.

38
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,879
 So, was that her?

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

40
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,079
 That was Debbie from the make- up department,
 confirming my call time for tomorrow.

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 Some excuse!

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,398
 -  Hector.
 -  Yes.

43
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,399
 Please could you pass me your fork?

44
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,639
 Here, I'm going.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 You can have my dinner!

46
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,879
 You should have seen Eunice's face!

47
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,079
 She was furious!

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 When Eunice gets angry,
 she is a very scary lady!

49
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,239
 Hello.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,678
 Yes.

51
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,679
 Excuse me. No, no, to her...

52
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,239
 Bye, Bridget.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 All right, Hector. Bye.

54
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,359
 Hola, Lola!

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 -  Guess what?
 -  Prince William wants to marry you?

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 I know that! No, I've got a promotion!

57
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,278
 That's nice.

58
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,998
 Nice? Nice!

59
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,999
 It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

60
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
 Eunice is no longer my boss!

61
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,078
 Is that Hugh Grant?

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,079
 It's Bridget Evans here.
 Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
 Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?

64
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,239
 Fab! Ciao!

65
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,038
 Eunice is so jealous!

66
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,039
 Now, that is good news.

67
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
 Annie, what are you doing?

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,678
 I'm doing my own editing.

69
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,679
 Why are you cutting up
 photos of you and Hector?

70
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,999
 Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,798
 Really?

72
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,839
 Why?

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Because he is having an affair!

74
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,239
 Really?! Who with?

75
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,599
 Well, I thought it was Eunice,
 but now I think it's Debbie.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.

77
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,279
 Lola? Who's she?

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
 He's women mad!

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,038
 It's fantastic!

81
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,039
 I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

82
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,319
 Hola, Lola!

83
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,918
 I didn't go out with Eunice!

84
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,919
 Yes, you did! And you stayed out
 till three o'clock in the morning!

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,319
 So, was that her?

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 -  Who?
 -  Debbie. The other woman!

87
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,039
 Hi, Nick.

88
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,438
 What are you doing?

89
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,439
 I am not doing, I am being.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,719
 What are you being?

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 -  Can't you guess?
 -  A man on the toilet?

92
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,679
 A Sumo wrestler?

93
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,479
 Can't you see? I am an egg.

94
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,039
 Of course, you are an egg.

95
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,479
 Now, what sort of egg am I?

96
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,079
 Hard- boiled.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,999
 -  Scrambled.
 -  Scrambled?

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 -  Fried.
 -  Nearly!

99
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,759
 Poached!

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
 Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.

101
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,318
 Yeah.

102
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,319
 Well, you're making a mess on your bed!

103
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,959
 It's my new acting class.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Total Being.

106
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,318
 What are you next week? A piece of wood?

107
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,319
 -  A piece of wood?
 -  Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,159
 Anyway, can poached eggs talk?

109
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,118
 Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.

110
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,958
 No, no, I mean,

111
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,959
 when you are
 'being' a poached egg, can you talk?

112
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,958
 Yeah.

113
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,959
 Anyway, I want to stop now,
 my arms are hurting.

114
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,198
 So, what do you want to talk about?

115
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,199
 It is Annie.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,919
 She thinks I am having an affair.

117
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
 -  Who with?
 -  Eunice.

118
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,038
 -  And Debbie.
 -  What?

119
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,399
 Two women, Hector!

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,438
 You cheeky thing!

121
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,439
 But I am not!

122
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,879
 -  So tell Annie then.
 -  I have but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,639
 -  Why not?
 -  I don't know.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
 Excuse me.

125
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,639
 Hola, Lola.

126
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,678
 I'll take this outside.

127
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,879
 How are you, Lola?

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 So, it's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?

129
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,599
 Stop, please!

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
 I knew it!

131
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,519
 It had to be a selfish man- driver!

132
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,359
 Please, I have a voucher.

133
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.

134
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,279
 Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 People park on yellow lines and then are
 surprised when they get a parking ticket!

137
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 There was this one guy today - 
 'Please, I have a voucher.'

138
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,438
 No excuse!

139
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,439
 Mind you, he was quite cute.

140
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,958
 Nick.

141
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
 Nick, are you OK?

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.

143
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,998
 Well, there's something wrong with Nick.

144
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,999
 -  Well, I could have told you that!
 -  No, he won't speak, he won't move.

145
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
 I know. He is being a poached egg.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 -  A what?
 -  For his new acting class.

147
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,919
 Hi, Nick.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,758
 Let me guess.

149
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,759
 You are being - a potato.

150
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,599
 Do I look like a potato?

151
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,839
 Yes. A couch potato!

152
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,118
 What about a fish?

153
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,119
 Yes, a frozen fish!

154
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,759
 I am not a fish.

155
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
 I...am...'Pain'.

156
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,758
 You are a pain.

157
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,759
 Yes, Nick is a pain!

158
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 No! I am 'Pain'.

159
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
 Hurt, agony.

160
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,039
 So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?

161
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,078
 What a day!

162
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,079
 I had a very important meeting.
 Big decisions to make.

163
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,959
 Like which celebrities,
 new programme ideas?

164
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
 No, like which pen to use at my meeting?

165
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,478
 Blue, black...

166
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,479
 -  Which one did you choose?
 -  Blue.

167
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,519
 Bad choice.

168
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
 You think so? Oh, no!

169
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,959
 Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job,
 she won't talk to anyone!

170
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 -  Not even you?
 -  Not even me! It is great!

171
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
 You don't want her to talk to you?

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
 -  Really?
 -  Really!

173
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
 Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,438
 So do I.

175
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,439
 -  I miss you.
 -  I miss...

176
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 Hola, Lola.

177
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 Right. Two can play that game.

178
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,759
 I am not doing, I am being.

179
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 A man on the toilet?

180
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,280
 Yeah!

181
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.

182
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,879
 It's not Eunice,
 it's not Debbie, could it be -  Lola?

183
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 Hola, Lola!

184
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?

185
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,599
 I am just doing my job - Zeus!

186
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,079
 -  Hello again.
 -  Hello.

187
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,199
 -  We meet again.
 -  You're happier today.

188
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,639
 Yes, I am now!

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,479
 But I'm sorry...

190
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 I parked here, so you would come back.

191
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,238
 You wanted to see me again?

192
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,239
 You are so beautiful!

193
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,919
 Well, I'm sorry
 but I am going to have to give you...

194
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,358
 -  No...
 -  This!

195
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,159
 My phone number.

196
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Call me.

197
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,439
 Who needs Hector?

198
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,719
 Hi, Bridget.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,518
 What 'oh'?

200
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,438
 I know -  Superman!

201
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,118
 -  What?
 -  I mean, Clark Kent.

202
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,839
 You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.

203
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,519
 No. I'm not.

204
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
 I'm long- sighted.

205
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,479
 You're being long- sighted?

206
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,518
 No.

207
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,598
 I am long- sighted.

208
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,599
 I need to wear glasses for reading.

209
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,799
 They suit you.

210
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 Thank you.
 So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?

211
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,319
 I'm working from home today.

212
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,878
 I've so much to do!

213
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,198
 Bridget, what's the matter?

214
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:48,199
 I can't do it! Eunice hates me!

215
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,399
 Eunice hates everybody!

216
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 -  They all hate me!
 -  No, they don't!

217
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 -  They all look at me!
 -  Bridget, you are their boss.

218
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,319
 I have to use the executive loo!

219
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,799
 What's the matter with that?

220
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 I want to chat to all the girls!

221
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,999
 Bridget...

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 you are one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful women I know.

223
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,518
 Really?

224
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,519
 -  Well, who are the others?
 -  What do you mean?

225
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,119
 You said I was only one of the cleverest,
 most beautiful girls you know.

226
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 Bridget! You can do this job.

227
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Channel 9 needs you.

228
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,239
 -  Thank you, Nick.
 -  Hey, it was nothing.

229
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,519
 You really look handsome in those glasses.

230
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,438
 Hi, Annie.

231
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,518
 Hi, Hector.

232
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,519
 -  You look smart.
 -  Yes, I am going to meet someone.

233
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 Annie, I have something to tell you.

234
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,519
 Sorry.

235
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
 Lola!

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 Vale. Si, si, ya voy.

237
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 Hasta luego.

238
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
 'Annie, I have something to tell you.'

239
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 That he is going on a date with Lola!
 That's what!

240
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

241
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,719
 Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.

242
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 Nick! Stop it!

243
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Is everybody happy, apart from me?

244
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,639
 Hello.

245
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,038
 Zeus! Hi!

246
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,039
 Well, of course I remember you!

247
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,598
 A drink? Tonight?

248
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,599
 Well, I'd love to.

249
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 Stop it! You're tickling me!

250
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.

251
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 -  Hi.
 -  Hi.

252
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,119
 Well, hello, Zeus!

253
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,758
 Annie, where did you find him?

254
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,759
 Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses,
 though, does he?

255
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,959
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?

256
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,079
 Wonderful, Annie.

257
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,319
 Now I must say goodnight.

258
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 Please, first may I use your bathroom?

259
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,839
 -  Certainly.
 -  Thank you.

260
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 Zeus is such a gentle man.

261
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,639
 He certainly is a man.

262
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,439
 Hi.

263
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,479
 Annie, I must talk to you.

264
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 What about? Your date with Lola?

265
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,758
 My date with Lola?

266
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,759
 Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old
 chief executive for ATV.

267
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 -  What's ATV?
 -  Argentinian Television.

268
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,158
 And...

269
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,159
 She wants me to return to Argentina
 to present their number one show.

270
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,679
 But I don't want to go.

271
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
 I want to stay here - with you.

272
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,559
 That's better.

273
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Hector, this is...

274
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 Zeus, my new boyfriend.

275
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,879
 We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!

277
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,199
 So, Hector, will you take the job?

278
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,839
 What do you think I should do, Annie?

279
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 So we must say goodbye
 to our friends for now.

280
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,759
 Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?

281
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 Will Annie go with him?

282
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

283
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,039
 Extra - will the story continue?!

284
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,159
 Extra - will the story continue?!

1
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,399
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,319
 They have a visitor from Argentina

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,999
 who speaks only a little English.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 What the girls don't know, but Nick does,

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 is that Hector is very, very rich.

6
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,799
 Does Hector like Bridget?
 Does Bridget like Hector?

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,038
 And who does Nick like?

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,039
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,159
 Job...stuntman.

10
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,559
 Age...20. 20?

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,959
 No. 30, more mature.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
 Age...30.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 -  Where's the fire?
 -  It's the smoke detector.

14
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,759
 I know that! Where's the broom?

15
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,399
 Oh, good, it's stopped.

16
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,799
 I think this was the problem.

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 Anyone for very hard- boiled eggs?

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 -  Nick.
 -  Eh?

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 -  Are they your eggs?
 -  Eh?

20
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,239
 I thought so!
 What on earth are you doing? Are you crazy?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Ah. Are my eggs ready?

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
 Oh... Your eggs, Hector.

23
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,639
 Hector's eggs, Bridget.

24
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,959
 Is he crazy?

25
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:31,559
 Hector...the eggs are, erm, ruined.

26
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,079
 Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

27
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,759
 Thank you, Bridget.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 Hm. Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

29
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,799
 What are you doing on our computer anyway?

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,318
 Nothing.

31
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,319
 Let's just say, girls,

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,478
 one day you will say,

33
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,479
 'Brad Pitt... Urgh! Pah!

34
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,999
 'Johnny Depp... Urgh! Pah!

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 'Nick from next door... Vroom- vroom- vroom!

36
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,239
 ''The coolest stuntman in the world.''

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,558
 Oh, you a stuntman!

38
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,559
 Yep. I got the job on the Internet.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,080
 Well, nearly. I'm waiting for confirmation.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,158
 Oh, how exciting!

41
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,159
 The coolest stuntman in the world.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 On a moped, right?

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 On a Harley- Davidson, actually.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
 Films! Those stars! That money!

45
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,558
 Oh! Oh!

46
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,559
 Have you seen Carina's dress in the magazine?
 I'd love to have a dress like that.

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
 Mm, me too.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
 It would really suit me.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 -  How much is it?
 -  Oh, let's see. Erm...

50
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,358
 How much?

51
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,359
 Oh, I'm a student. It's too expensive for me.

52
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,159
 I've got a job and it's too expensive for me.

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 We need more money.

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,478
 Money?

55
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,479
 Bridget, Annie, I have something to tell you.

56
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,599
 Hector, don't. It's a secret.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
 ''The Romero family,
 one of the richest families in Argentina.''

58
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,318
 Keep it a secret. Shh. Eh?

59
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,319
 Shh.

60
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,238
 What's a secret?

61
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:59,239
 You have been very kind.

62
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,519
 Yes, Hector.

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 I'm sure Bridget and Annie
 have a little money.

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,958
 Shh, Nick.

65
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,959
 So I want to...

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
 I want to give you some money.

67
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,238
 Yes?

68
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,239
 So, I am going...

69
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,878
 to look for a job.

70
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,879
 Oh... That's a great idea, Hector.

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,078
 Great!

72
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,079
 Yeah, we can look for a job on the Internet,
 can't we?

73
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,039
 -  OK, here we are. Job vacancies.
 -  Well, let's see.

74
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,679
 Oh. Well, there's a job in a launderette.

75
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,959
 Hector!

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,958
 No.

77
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,959
 And there's a job as a gardener.

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
 My plant!

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
 No.

80
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,439
 Erm, here's a job as a cook.

81
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,999
 No.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 Wait a minute. Look at this.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,438
 A waiter!

84
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,519
 What a great idea!

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 Yes! Ooh, I love good- looking waiters!

86
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,879
 Did you say good- looking? Here I am.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 What about Hector as a waiter?

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,198
 A waiter?

89
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,199
 Yeah. You know.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 Oh, but I don't know how.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
 Oh, don't worry. I will teach you.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Hello.

93
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,759
 Howard!

94
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,518
 How are you?

95
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
 (Laughs) Oh, thank you, Howard.

96
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,119
 Me? Dinner tonight?

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
 Seven o'clock at the Singing Parrot Cafe.

98
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,438
 OK, Howard.

99
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,439
 Bye, Howard.

100
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,399
 That was Howard.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,159
 No!

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,079
 He's invited me to dinner tonight

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 because he wants to...
 talk to me about a new job!

104
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,799
 Who is Howard?

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,559
 Bridget's boss.

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 He is so rich, he's so clever
 and he wants to see me!

107
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
 He might offer me a promotion.

108
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,959
 What shall I wear?

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 I have nothing to wear!

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 No! Wrong!

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,159
 Huh!

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,999
 So last season.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,958
 Bet Howard can't ride a motorbike.

114
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,158
 Nope.

115
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,159
 I hope he does give Bridget promotion...

116
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Although I have heard Howard has a nickname.

117
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,479
 (Bridget) What was I thinking?

118
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,678
 What?

119
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,679
 The Octopus.

120
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 The Octopus?

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Oh, The Octopus!

122
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:45,078
 Is he meeting her alone?

123
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,439
 Yes.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
 No, no!

125
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
 -  Bridget needs help.
 -  We must stop her.

126
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,519
 I have an idea.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,118
 Why don't you eat here?

128
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,438
 No!

129
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,439
 Yes, then we can both talk to your boss
 about your new job.

130
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,638
 Here?

131
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,639
 No. No way.

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,838
 I could cook for you.

133
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
 Huh! Definitely not, no.

134
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,159
 And I could be your waiter.

135
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,918
 N...

136
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,919
 I want to be your waiter.

137
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,439
 Yeah, OK, then, but be serious.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 Don't worry,
 we will help you get your promotion.

139
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,879
 Leave it to us.

140
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,759
 I am going...

141
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,919
 to look for a job.

142
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,559
 My plant!

143
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,639
 Hm.

144
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,958
 A waiter?

145
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,959
 Yeah. You know.

146
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,758
 OK, Hector,

147
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,759
 you are the waiter so you must set the table.

148
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,919
 Yes, I have set the table

149
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,638
 but there is one problem.

150
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,718
 A problem?

151
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,719
 The table is too small.

152
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:22,319
 -  The table is too small?
 -  Yes. Look.

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
 Hector, this is set for 12 courses.

154
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,039
 Dinner at home is always like this.

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 Well, yes! You are a million...

156
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,919
 You are a millionaire.

157
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
 This is just a little dinner for Bridget's boss.

158
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,479
 -  OK?
 -  OK.

159
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 OK. I am the customer.

160
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,079
 Where would you like to sit?

161
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,359
 Hm.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 Here.

163
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,279
 Oh, I... Erm...

164
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,558
 The bill.

165
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,559
 Not yet. The menu first.

166
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
 Oh, sorry. Erm... The menu.

167
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,799
 Ah.

168
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 Forget the menu. What have you got today?

169
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 -  To eat?
 -  To eat.

170
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,199
 Today, as dish of the day,

171
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,799
 I have a delicious hot cat.

172
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 -  A hot cat?
 -  Mm- hm.

173
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,199
 That's a hot dog.

174
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 Ah! Hot cat, hot dog!

175
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,719
 Cat...hot...dog...

176
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 Oh, no!

177
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,239
 Oh, how's it going?

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
 Great! Nick is a good teacher.

179
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:19,439
 -  Let's see.
 -  Uh- uh. Hector's Cafe is now closed.

180
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,679
 Oh!

181
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
 I'll get it.

182
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 Delivery, Miss Evans and Miss Taylor.

183
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,599
 Thank you.

184
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 Oh! Bridget, look!

185
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 ''For lovely Annie from H.''

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,040
 ''For beautiful Bridget from H.''

187
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,680
 -  Who's H?
 -  Oh, it must be Howard!

188
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 Ooh, what is it?

189
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 Oh, Bridget!

190
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,079
 Look, it's Carina's dress!

191
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,918
 But how did he guess?

192
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,919
 Oh, he's a clever man!

193
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,479
 Anyway, it's not Carina's dress now,
 it's Bridget's dress!

194
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:15,239
 Oh, thank you, Howard!

195
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,359
 Oh, Bridget, isn't your boss kind?

196
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,399
 But why did he buy me one?

197
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
 Oh, I've told him all about you.

198
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 Me? Dinner tonight?

199
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,839
 He's so clever and he wants to see me!

200
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,319
 Oh, thank you, Howard.

201
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,959
 -  The Octopus!
 -  Ugh!

202
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,759
 We will help you get your promotion.

203
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,078
 Wow!

204
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,798
 OK, Nick?

205
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
 Yeah. Hot. The soup, hot.

206
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,239
 Uh- uh- uh- uh- uh. The soup is hot.

207
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:06,239
 Thank you, Hector.

208
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,479
 He's here.

209
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,199
 -  Good evening, Howard.
 -  Ah, Bridget, my princess!

210
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,159
 Please come in.

211
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,160
 Bridget, you look divine.

212
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,479
 Oh, this must be Annie.
 Are you sisters? Such beauty!

213
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,159
 The dresses are exquisite.

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
 Oh...

215
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,679
 Thank you.

216
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 -  Thank you.
 -  Don't thank me. It's a privilege.

217
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,639
 Oh, and this, of course, is Nick.

218
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,079
 Hi.

219
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
 And this is Hector. He's from Argentina.

220
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,399
 -  Hello.
 -  Argentina?

221
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,839
 -  Do you have a cow?
 -  Two million.

222
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 -  What?
 -  My parents own two million cows.

223
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,639
 Er, yes, thank you, Hector.

224
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 -  Hector's English is a little...
 -  Weird.

225
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,599
 Never mind, Hector.

226
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,679
 -  So, Bridget...
 -  Ooh!

227
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 What a beautiful apartment for a beautiful lady.

228
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,239
 Dinner is served.

229
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,519
 Hector, go on.

230
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,440
 Today we have sick pea soup.

231
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
 Mm. Sick pea soup. My favourite!

232
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,119
 Chickpea. Chickpea.

233
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
 Er...chickpea soup.

234
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,239
 This guy is great.
 Where did you find him?

235
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
 Sick pea soup!

236
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:21,439
 Mind you, it does look like...bleurgh!

237
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
 Sorry, Nick.

238
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,359
 Main course. Teeth casserole.

239
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,278
 Teeth casserole?

240
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,158
 Beef. Beef.

241
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,159
 Sorry. Beef casserole.

242
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 I bet the beef is as hard as teeth.
 A dinner with bite!

243
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,599
 Oh! Sorry, Nick.

244
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,239
 So, Bridget, you would like a better job?

245
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,879
 Well, Howard, I...

246
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,678
 Are you willing to work harder, huh?

247
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,679
 Agh!

248
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,638
 You stupid idiot!

249
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,639
 Sorry, er...

250
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,519
 And, Bridget, with your good looks...

251
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 What a creep.

252
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 Hey! It's cold!

253
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 Hector! I want hot coffee.

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He wants hot coffee.

255
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,119
 Then he will have hot coffee.

256
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 So, by the age of 20

257
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,839
 I had 50 people working for me.

258
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,199
 Fascinating.

259
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 My father said,

260
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,719
 ''If you want more money, you must work hard.''

261
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 Hey! You have poisoned me!

262
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,119
 You fool! You stupid boy!

263
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,918
 Stupid?

264
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,919
 Don't you dare
 talk to my friend Hector like that!

265
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,840
 Oh, what is he?
 Is your boyfriend or something?

266
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 He is...

267
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:45,479
 a kind and clever and lovely man,

268
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 which is something that you will never, ever be.

269
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,239
 So you can keep your job, you creep!

270
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:58,479
 -  And we'll send you back the dresses.
 -  What dresses?

271
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,879
 Oh, these dresses,
 the ones you bought Annie and me.

272
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,718
 I did not buy those dresses.

273
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,719
 I would not spend money on you! Ha!

274
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,878
 Goodbye, Howard.

275
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,879
 You've lost your job.

276
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,359
 Well, too late. I quit!

277
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
 Howard said he did not buy the dresses.

278
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,558
 So who did?

279
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,559
 If H isn't for Howard...

280
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,959
 Then H is for Hector!

281
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,959
 You? But why did you buy the dresses?

282
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,679
 To say thank you.

283
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
 But they're so expensive.
 Where did you get the money?

284
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
 I...found it.

285
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,319
 Well, these expensive dresses
 must go back to the shop.

286
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
 Yes, they must.

287
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,278
 But not until tomorrow.

288
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,918
 That's right! Let's go clubbing!

289
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,919
 Come on, Nick, Hector!

290
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
 See you later, boys!

291
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,239
 Hector, you are a true, true friend.

292
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,278
 Money is not everything.

293
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,279
 So, what did you buy me?

294
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,879
 What do you think?

295
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,319
 I love you. I love you.

296
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,359
 Hm. One moment.

297
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 You didn't buy me a bike.
 You didn't buy me a bike.

298
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,518
 You didn't buy me a bike.

299
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,519
 OK?

300
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 Thanks, Hector. It's really, really...

301
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,679
 It's OK, Nick.

302
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,759
 Hop on. I'll give you a lift.

303
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,398
 Hey...

304
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:32,399
 So do you still want to be a waiter?

305
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,799
 No, I want to be like you, Nick. A stuntman!

306
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,759
 Aaagh!

307
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,479
 Next time in Extra...

308
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,919
 Nick gets a job on TV

309
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 Annie loves watching TV

310
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,079
 And why does Hector want to learn to cook?

311
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,439
 And why does Hector want to learn to cook?

1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,640
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,759
 The girls like Hector because he is...pure.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 And Nick likes Hector because he is rich.

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,439
 And Hector likes Nick
 because he is one crazy guy.

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,759
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,758
 But I can't live without you.

8
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,719
 I love you.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
 I love you too, but it's for the best.
 It's finished.

10
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:25,279
 Oh! Oh, darling, no. I'll die without you.

11
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,879
 Ohh. She can't!

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
 No, she can't. He's too good- looking.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
 And her husband is so awful.

14
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,679
 I'm sorry. I'm more sorry than you are.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
 It's your turn.

16
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,879
 Hello.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 A message for who? Rock Thrust?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Erm, I'm sorry,
 but I think you have the wrong number.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 That's OK. Bye.

20
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,638
 Well, who was that?

21
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,639
 Someone wanted Rock Thrust.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 Rock Thrust? What a stupid name.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,559
 I know. Who would have a silly name like that?

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 Go, go, go, go, go!

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,478
 Go!

26
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,759
 It's a raid!

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
 Don't move. Legs in the air.

28
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,399
 Hands. Not legs. Hands in the air.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,679
 OK.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
 Hands in the air.

31
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,759
 Hello, Nick. Hello, Hector.

32
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,479
 -  How did you know it was us?
 -  Huh?

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
 Oh, lucky guess.

34
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,959
 Great. It's like Piccadilly Circus here
 on a Friday night.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,359
 Uh?

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 This apartment is very busy.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 Crazy phone calls, crazy names and now the FBI!

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 So, Bridget darling, any messages for me?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 What do you mean, messages?

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,878
 Who do you think I am? Your secretary?

41
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,879
 This is not your apartment. You do not live here.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,799
 I never have any privacy.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,039
 But they cut off my telephone.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 That's not my problem.
 You should pay your bills.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,718
 Sorry, Bridget.

46
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,719
 And, Hector, you live with Nick now.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 Please knock on the door.

48
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,279
 Now, I want to be alone.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 Well, that went well. What's wrong with her?

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,119
 -  Nick, what day is it?
 -  Erm, Wednesday.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 -  And what time is it?
 -  I know. Half past six.

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 -  So...
 -  So...

53
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,919
 So what's on television?

54
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,999
 Oh, Love's True Dream.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 Love's True Dream. What is that?

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 Oh, Alberto, Alberto!

57
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,599
 I love you, I love you!

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 And I love you too, Penelope.

59
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,919
 -  Bridget's favourite programme.
 -  Yeah, and mine.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 Oh, really, Annie? Why?

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,399
 Because it's about the simple love

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
 of a boy from Argentina and a girl from England.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,399
 Uh?

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
 The simple love of a boy from Argentina
 and a girl from England.

65
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,599
 Oh.

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 Nice.

67
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 Oh, Hector! I love this advert.

68
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,758
 What is it?

69
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,759
 It's for chocolate mousse. Shh.

70
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,999
 Chocolate so smooth
 it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.

71
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,399
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 Mmm, I love chocolate mousse.

73
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,199
 Hey! This advert's good too.

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,919
 # Ooh! Popcorn in the microwave

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,598
 # Popcorn in just seconds

76
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,879
 # Popcorn in your tummy

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,199
 # They're Poptastic #

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 Ha! And do you like popcorn, Annie?

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 Oh, yeah, especially Poptastic popcorn.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,799
 Well, we don't have
 Poptastic popcorn in Argentina,

81
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,159
 but we make great popcorn.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 -  Yeah?
 -  Yes. I'll make it in the frying pan.

83
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,919
 Oh, yes! Yes, great!

84
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,159
 I've got the part! I've got the part!

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 Wow, man! That is great! Hey!

86
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,798
 What is it?

87
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,799
 Let's just say
 that my face will be on your television

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 every night at six o'clock
 in front of a huge audience.

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
 Oh- ho! Ladies and gentleman, a star is born!

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,318
 Oh, Nick, that's fantastic!

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,798
 Ha- ha! This is it, Nick.

92
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,799
 Today, London, tomorrow, Hollywood.

93
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 I'd just like to thank my parents,
 my brothers, my sisters...

94
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,079
 my dog, his vet...

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
 and of course my adorable girlfriend Bridget.

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
 Huh! I don't think so.

97
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,158
 Anyway, what's going on?

98
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,558
 Oh, it's wonderful news, Bridget.

99
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
 Nick is going to be on television.

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,759
 Well, tell us, Nick. What is it?

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
 Well, it's on every night.

102
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,758
 It'll be hot.

103
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,759
 Sometimes it'll be stormy.

104
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 So will you still love me when I'm a superstar?

105
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,919
 Yes, Nick, and I'm going to help you
 to be a great superstar.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,398
 Yes!

107
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,398
 Lesson number one.

108
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
 This is how all superstars make a big exit.

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 Goodbye, Nick. See you at the Oscars.

110
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,238
 -  Annie?
 -  Uh- huh?

111
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,239
 I really think you're watching too many adverts.

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,239
 What do you mean, too many adverts?

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Well, remember Chunky Chunks?

114
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,119
 Oh, Chunky Chunks...

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 Hello and welcome
 to the Chunky Chunks challenge.

116
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,959
 Nick, in front of you are two plates

117
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,679
 and all you have to do is tell me
 which plate is Chunky Chunks - 

118
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,159
 A or B.

119
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,638
 Ready? OK.

120
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,639
 This is Plate A.

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
 Good. And this is Plate B.

122
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,359
 OK, Nick.

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
 Which plate do you think was Chunky Chunks?
 A or B?

124
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 Well, they both smelled great.

125
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,918
 Correct! Well done!

126
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,919
 Both plates were Chunky Chunks.

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,639
 -  By the way, Annie...
 -  Uh- huh?

128
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,639
 What are Chunky Chunks?

129
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
 Dog food, of course.

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
 -  Do you see what I mean?
 -  Oh, I think so.

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,078
 What's that noise?

132
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,079
 Oh, Annie's popcorn!

133
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,879
 -  My popcorn?
 -  Yes, I wanted to make popcorn just for you.

134
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 Oh, Hector, thank you. Oh, you are sweet.

135
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 I like popcorn too, Hector.

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
 -  Rock Thrust? What a stupid name!
 -  I know!

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
 Go, go, go, go, go!

138
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,559
 # Popcorn in your tummy

139
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 # They're Poptastic #

140
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
 Man, that is great!

141
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 Today, London, tomorrow, Hollywood.

142
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 Ah. I co- starred with Russell Crowe in this one.

143
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,518
 You, in Gladiator?

144
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,519
 Wow, Nick, I didn't realise. What were you?

145
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,559
 The centurion.

146
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,919
 Which centurion?

147
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 Er... Ah! Here it is.

148
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,838
 There, that's me, on the ground.

149
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,599
 Huh! A dead centurion.

150
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Yeah, good, eh?
 I had some words, but they were cut.

151
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
 -  What did you say?
 -  Erm...

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 Hey, but now I've got the whole script
 just for me on television every night.

153
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,999
 Nick, tell me.

154
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,119
 -  What is it?
 -  It's my show.

155
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,239
 When I'm a star, I will not forget you, my friend.

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,759
 ..at 5:30pm today

157
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 when I'll show you how to make
 a delicious chocolate mousse,

158
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,679
 a dessert for lovers.

159
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 You'll need chocolate, eggs and butter.

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 And don't forget the way to a heart
 is through the stomach.

161
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,239
 The way to the heart is through the stomach.
 What does that mean?

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 It means if you want a girlfriend, cook for her.

163
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
 I want to learn how to cook.

164
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 Anyway, what do you mean
 by I watch too many adverts?

165
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 Well, remember when you wanted us
 to change our washing powder?

166
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,239
 Oh- ho! Hello there.

167
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,479
 As a mother,
 I must fight difficult stains every day.

168
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,479
 Tomato ketchup.

169
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:43,239
 Chocolate...ooh!

170
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 Gravy.

171
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
 And...egg.

172
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,319
 But help is here.

173
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
 I will wash one shirt in ordinary washing powder

174
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,079
 and the other in new Zap!

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 So, the shirt
 washed in normal washing powder is...

176
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,599
 Oh! Still dirty.

177
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 But the shirt washed in new Zap! is...

178
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,519
 Oh.

179
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 Annie, have you seen my red T- shirt anywhere?

180
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,079
 Oops!

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
 See what I mean?

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
 -  Oh, hello, Bridget.
 -  Hello, Hector.

183
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,919
 Oh, hi, Annie.

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
 Oh, thank you. Yes, I know.

185
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,358
 Do you know where Nick is?

186
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,039
 -  No, we've just arrived.
 -  I'm a great actor.

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,118
 Erm, I think I know where Nick is.

188
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,119
 (Nick) ..love to do the part, but I'm too busy.

189
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,919
 No, it's not the money.

190
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,639
 I don't need 15 million quid.

191
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,559
 Look, talk to my agent, Bridget, hm?

192
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,118
 I have an idea.

193
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,119
 Oh. So Robert De Niro said yes already?

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 Hm? Well...

195
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
 -  Hello.
 -  Hello?

196
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,958
 -  Nick Jessop?
 -  Yeah.

197
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
 I have an executive from Warner Brothers
 on the line for you.

198
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,439
 Right.

199
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,479
 Hello, Nick.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 You are very big in England.

201
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,959
 What are you working on now?

202
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 Hi. Well, it's something
 that all of England watches.

203
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 It's the, erm...

204
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,999
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- ha.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,119
 You can laugh,

206
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
 but tomorrow night at six o'clock

207
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,239
 you will see that Nick from next door

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,598
 has star quality

209
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,599
 and then Spielberg will call.

210
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
 Now, excuse me, I must learn my line.

211
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,999
 Hello and welcome
 to the Chunky Chunks challenge.

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 New Zap!

213
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,919
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

214
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,279
 Hello, all you gorgeous chefs. Mwah.

215
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,159
 And welcome to Charlotte's Kitchen.

216
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,078
 Today...mmm...

217
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,079
 chocolate mousse, a dessert for lovers.

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
 -  First, take some chocolate.
 -  Chocolate.

219
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,398
 And melt it over hot water.

220
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,399
 Melt?

221
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,399
 Oh! Over hot water.

222
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,319
 Now, my darlings, you must
 separate the eggs into two bowls.

223
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 Separate the eggs?

224
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,559
 Separate the yolk from the white.

225
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,759
 Oh, the yolk from...

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,639
 -  Hector?
 -  Ah, hello, Annie.

227
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 Mix the yolk and the chocolate.

228
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,159
 Add the butter.

229
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
 And now for the fun -  whisking!

230
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,039
 I love whisking. Don't you?

231
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 -  Oh, whisking?
 -  Ah! You need Annie's magic whisk.

232
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 Yes, please.

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,599
 Nearly finished, my darlings.

234
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 Finally, add the whites to the chocolate

235
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,479
 and put it in the fridge.

236
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,518
 And in 30 minutes,

237
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,519
 this delicious chocolate mousse
 will be ready for your lover to taste -  mm!

238
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
 And put it in the fridge.

239
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,440
 Why, Hector, who's the lucky lady?

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 I think I know!

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Chocolate mousse, my favourite dessert.

242
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,799
 Nick! What time is it?

243
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 -  Six o'clock.
 -  Quick! Change channels!

244
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,159
 It's six o'clock
 and time for the weather with Rock Thrust!

245
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,199
 With Rock Thrust.

246
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,799
 Oh, me. I'm ready.

247
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 -  The weather?
 -  Rock Thrust?

248
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,438
 Nick!

249
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,439
 Hi! I'm Rock Thrust.

250
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,599
 -  Get on with it.
 -  Huh.

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 And here is the weather. Big smile.

252
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 And here is the weather.

253
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 In the south, it will be hot.

254
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,839
 Sun, sun.

255
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
 Oh, sorry. Hot.

256
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,679
 So put on your beach clothes.

257
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 And in the west, it'll be windy.

258
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
 And in the east, it will rain,

259
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,439
 so don't forget your, um...

260
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,199
 ..brella.

261
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
 And there could be some...

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 Oh, no. Not lightning.

263
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,879
 And that's the weather with me, Rock Thrust.

264
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 Ah, come in and sit down.

265
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,159
 Close your eyes.

266
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 Now, are you ready for a taste of paradise?

267
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:38,399
 Chocolate so smooth

268
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,999
 it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.

269
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
 Ready?

270
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,080
 Mmm!

271
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 Chocolate mousse,
 the chocolate dessert for lovers.

272
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,239
 Oh, Hector, that was so much fun!

273
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,439
 I love doing adverts,
 especially with your delicious chocolate mousse.

274
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 Oh, I'm glad you like it.

275
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,399
 Well, hello! It's Rock Thrust.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,559
 Would you like your messages, Mr Thrust?

277
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,318
 As your agent, I take ten per cent.

278
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,319
 Oh, poor Nick. You must be very tired now.

279
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,278
 Yeah, I am.

280
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,279
 Working in television must be exhausting.

281
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,359
 Yes, because I had to run
 all the way from the studio.

282
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,158
 Run? Why?

283
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,159
 Because I was chased.

284
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,719
 Next time in Extra...

285
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Bridget wins the lottery.

286
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,839
 Nick finds love at the traffic lights.

287
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 And why does Hector become a dustman?

288
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:21,879
 And why does Hector become a dustman?

289
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880


1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,600
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,878
 Annie fancies Nick

4
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,039
 but Nick fancies Bridget

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,519
 who fancies Hector.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 But guess what. Hector fancies Annie.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
 How are they going to solve their problems?

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
 More money! It's my lucky day.

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,318
 Now, where was I?

11
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,319
 99, 100.

12
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,719
 Good, that's done.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 Now the cushions.

14
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,519
 In my special order,

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
 orange, pink, purple...

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,358
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Hector.

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,959
 Red.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,999
 Hi, Annie.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,558
 -  I'm just...
 -  No!

20
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,398
 Bridget, no!

21
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,238
 It's OK, Bridget, you didn't see it.

22
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,878
 You didn't see it!

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,759
 What are you wearing? Take it off!

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,398
 What?

25
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,399
 Your shirt. It's that colour.

26
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,958
 Take it off.

27
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
 This shirt? What is wrong with the colour?
 What's wrong with yell...

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 Don't say it! Don't say that colour.

29
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,159
 Just take it off

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
 and throw it out.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 OK, OK.

32
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,278
 Done?

33
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,679
 Done.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 Bridget must not see anybody
 wearing that colour.

35
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,678
 Why?

36
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,679
 Because that colour...

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,718
 is very unlucky for me

38
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
 and today is Lotto day!

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,358
 Lotto day. What...

40
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,359
 The lottery.

41
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,519
 I pick five numbers.

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
 My numbers are: 66, 11, 89,

43
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,439
 18 and 69.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 If my numbers are the same
 as the lottery numbers on television,

45
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,598
 I win millions!

46
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,599
 I've never heard of it.

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,919
 Bridget gets very excited.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 But I know how to keep calm.

49
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,239
 Yoga.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 So, there we are, Hector.

51
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,078
 Great. I am going shopping.

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,799
 -  Do you need anything?
 -  Yes.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 Could you get my dress
 from the dry- cleaner's, please?

54
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,198
 Dry- cleaner's? OK.

55
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,199
 The blue ticket is on the board.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,198
 Got it.

57
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,199
 See you later, Bridget.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,118
 -  Hector!
 -  Hi, Nick.

59
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,119
 I've just been to see Bridget.

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,039
 Yes, I can see.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,678
 Anyway, where are you going?

62
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,679
 I am going shopping.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,279
 Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 Come in here. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,238
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

66
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,159
 Pen, pen, I need a...

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 Pen. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7. Paper.

68
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,439
 Paper! 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 -  Thanks, Hector.
 -  What is it?

70
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,599
 Today I met a girl called Emily.

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 She is very beautiful.

72
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,559
 Long, blonde hair,

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,639
 -  big...
 -  Yes?

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,399
 ..blue eyes.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
 And she is crazy about me.

76
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,438
 Where did you meet her?

77
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,439
 She was in her sports car.

78
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,958
 At the traffic lights.

79
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,959
 I asked her for a lift, she said no.

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 But she shouted her phone number.

81
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,039
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

82
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,639
 I see.

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,118
 Hey!

84
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,119
 Maybe she has a friend or a sister.

85
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,198
 Wow, yeah!

86
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,199
 Let's go out. Today...is my lucky day.

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 Now it's time for the National Lottery.

88
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,759
 Good.

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,638
 Is this my lucky day?

90
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,639
 And the numbers are...

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,079
 Yes?

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 Hello, Mother.

93
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 Yes, well, I'm a bit busy.

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
 Can I call you...back?

95
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,398
 I've won!

96
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,398
 Mum, I've won!

97
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,399
 I must go.

98
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
 And those were this week's lucky numbers.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,718
 What is it?

100
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,719
 Annie...

101
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,719
 Bridget, I can't understand you!

102
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,439
 Annie,

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 I have won

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 the National Lottery!

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,038
 From now on,

106
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,039
 it will be a life of luxury.

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,479
 Designer clothes.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
 Exotic holidays.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,359
 Luxury homes.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
 The very best restaurants.

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 Mixing with the stars.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But of course I will give
 a lot of money to charity.

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,638
 No more work,

114
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,398
 no more bosses.

115
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,079
 In fact,

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 I'll call now and resign.

117
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,839
 Hello, this is Harry Bowler.

118
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,318
 Leave a message and I'll ring you back.

119
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,718
 Harry, it's Bridget.

120
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,639
 I resign!

121
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,678
 I quit!

122
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,959
 I'm off!

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,999
 Keep your job.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Goodbye.

125
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,599
 Oh, dear.

126
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,278
 From now on,

127
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,998
 no more bosses for Bridget.

128
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,998
 Bridget is the boss.

129
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,999
 Now, I'll just get my lucky little ticket.

130
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,919
 What is it?

131
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,919
 My lottery ticket...

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,479
 has disappeared.

133
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 What?

134
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
 But the dry- cleaning ticket is still there.

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 Hector has taken the wrong ticket.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 We'll go to the dry- cleaner's.

137
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 99, 100.

138
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,680
 Got it!

139
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,879
 My lottery ticket has disappeared.

140
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,960
 Hey, Nick, that waitress really likes you.

141
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
 Two girls in one day.

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Call me...Mr Irresistible!

143
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,679
 -  Hi, girls.
 -  Hi, Bridget.

144
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,039
 Your dress, Bridget. I forgot, sorry.

145
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,079
 How did you collect the cleaning

146
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
 when I had the ticket?

147
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,559
 No, Hector, darling.

148
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
 You have the wrong ticket.

149
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,758
 I have the wrong ticket?

150
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,439
 You have the wrong ticket.

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,758
 Now give it to me.

152
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,759
 Yes, I have it here, Bridget.

153
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,839
 You have got the ticket, Hector?

154
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 Yes, I have got the ticket, Bridget.

155
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 I have lost the ticket.

156
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,879
 You have lost the ticket, Hector?

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 I have lost the ticket, Bridget.

158
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,679
 You've lost the ticket, Hector.
 You can't have lost the ticket!

159
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,159
 Emily's number is on the back!

160
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,079
 Are you OK, Bridget?

161
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
 The ticket you took from the board

162
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 was not the dry- cleaning ticket.

163
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,359
 It was my lottery ticket.

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
 My winning lottery ticket.

165
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 I am a multimillionaire.

166
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 But with no ticket!

167
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,239
 And you,

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
 you can stop smiling
 because this is your fault too!

169
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,479
 OK!

170
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,439
 Nick, Hector,

171
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,798
 where have you been?

172
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,799
 Well, first we went to the CD shop.

173
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 No, no, no.

174
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 First we went to Leo's Cafe.

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,878
 Remember the waitress?

176
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,879
 Yeah! She was...

177
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
 Yes, and...

178
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 Then we went to the CD shop.

179
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 Then we went to Cool Man.

180
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,119
 And then we went to the motorbike showroom.

181
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Stop!

182
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 So, you are going back to look for it.

183
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,198
 Yes, ma'am!

184
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,199
 And don't come back until you've found it, OK?

185
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,118
 OK!

186
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,119
 The ticket must be claimed
 by ten o'clock tonight.

187
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,999
 Now get going.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Yeah.

189
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,999
 Understood?

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Understood!

191
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,879
 You can say that again!

192
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 OK, Hector.
 I hope you find the ticket. See you later.

193
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 Whoa! Where are you going?

194
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,759
 Well, I am going to the traffic lights.
 Emily might return.

195
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,199
 I can't ring her because her number
 is on the lost ticket, remember?

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Yeah, but what shall I do?

197
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,558
 Look for the ticket, of course.

198
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,559
 Yeah, but what shall I say?

199
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,159
 Well, you say...

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,558
 OK,

201
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,559
 I am the shopkeeper.

202
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,599
 You are you.

203
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 -  Great!
 -  OK.

204
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,119
 Good afternoon.

205
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,198
 Good afternoon.

206
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,199
 I have lost my ticket.

207
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,359
 What sort of ticket?

208
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 -  My winning lottery ticket.
 -  Your winning...

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,238
 Wait a moment.

210
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,239
 You can't say,
 'I have lost my winning lottery ticket.'

211
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,238
 Why not?

212
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:27,239
 Because if they know
 it is a winning lottery ticket,

213
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,199
 they will keep the money, they will hide it.

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 So you must be someone else.

215
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,959
 Who?

216
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 Someone who can search the rubbish bins.

217
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,198
 Search the rubbish bins?

218
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
 That's it, a dustman.

219
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,118
 -  Dustman?
 -  Yeah!

220
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,119
 A dustman can search the rubbish bins.

221
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,398
 Great idea, Nick.

222
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,879
 Yeah, great idea, Nick.

223
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 Come on, you need to prepare.

224
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,799
 Emily's number is on the back!

225
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,400
 Now get going!

226
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,438
 -  Hello?
 -  Hello?

227
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
 -  Hector?
 -  Hello, Bridget.

228
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,198
 Have you found the ticket?

229
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,199
 No, not yet.

230
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,198
 Well, where's Nick?

231
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,199
 -  At the traffic lights.
 -  What?

232
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,279
 At the traffic lights?

233
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 Well, call me when you've found the ticket!

234
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 Bye...

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Leo: Today you will have a big surprise.

236
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,678
 -  Well?
 -  Well...

237
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,719
 -  Well?
 -  Well, what?

238
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,238
 Any luck?

239
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,518
 Yes and no.

240
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,838
 Yes and no?

241
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,839
 The bad news is, I didn't find her.

242
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,918
 -  Who?
 -  Emily.

243
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,479
 Emily who?

244
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
 Emily, the girl at the traffic lights.

245
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
 -  The good news is...
 -  Yes?

246
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:29,199
 I made £50 cleaning windscreens.

247
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,799
 Where's Hector?

248
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,919
 Where's my ticket?

249
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 Look at the time. It's ten to ten!

250
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
 Ten to ten? I haven't fed Charley.

251
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,199
 Where is Charley? I must find him.

252
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,279
 Charley was asleep on my bed this afternoon.

253
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,959
 Thanks, Nick.

254
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 There you are, Charley.

255
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,879
 Charley?

256
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
 What's this?

257
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,199
 Bridget!

258
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 Bridget, I found it! Your ticket!

259
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,038
 -  What?
 -  Where?

260
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,119
 On Nick's bed.

261
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 -  Who?
 -  On Nick's bed.

262
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,439
 -  Well, give it to me.
 -  No, give it to me.

263
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,959
 -  It's my ticket.
 -  Emily's number's on the back!

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 -  It's mine!
 -  Give it to me!

265
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,719
 It's OK, it's OK.

266
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 I'll stick it back together.

267
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
 Done!

268
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
 Thank you.

269
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
 Now I can claim my money.

270
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
 Hi, Hector.

271
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,839
 Poor Hector.

272
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
 I've just found the ticket on Nick's bed.
 Isn't it exciting?

273
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,879
 Yeah, great.

274
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 I can call Emily now.

275
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,598
 Great.

276
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,599
 -  When Bridget has finished.
 -  Great.

277
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,559
 Hello.

278
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 I'd like to claim my prize money, please.

279
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,958
 My numbers are:

280
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,959
 66, 11, 89,

281
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,959
 18 and 69.

282
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,479
 What?

283
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 What do you mean,
 they're not the winning numbers?

284
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 Well, what are your numbers, then?

285
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,079
 69, 81,

286
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,879
 68, 11 and 99?

287
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,479
 But how?

288
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 I know what happened.

289
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 Bridget, what were you doing
 while watching the lottery?

290
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 My yoga.

291
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,319
 Which position?

292
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,599
 This one.

293
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,519
 Exactly.

294
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 These are your numbers, but...

295
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
 ..this way.

296
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,318
 Bravo, Hector.

297
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,319
 It was nothing.

298
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,479
 Emily's number.

299
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

300
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,799
 It's ringing.

301
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Hello.

302
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,199
 Is Emily there?

303
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,278
 No?

304
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,278
 Who are you?

305
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,279
 Jack's Taxis?

306
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 Emily, you tricked me!

307
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
 What an unlucky day.

308
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,719
 Well, it can't get any worse.

309
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:00,198
 Yes, it can.

310
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:02,838
 The phone call.

311
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,839
 My job.

312
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,039
 We must get that tape back.

313
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,318
 Now.

314
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,319
 And I know just the men

315
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,679
 for the job.

316
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,038
 Oh, no!

317
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,039
 Oh, yes!

318
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,719
 Nick, should we be here?

319
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,239
 It's OK. Bridget said it was OK.

320
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,078
 Look, there is the answerphone.

321
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,079
 Quick, get the tape!

322
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,759
 Security. Who's there?

323
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,238
 Next time in Extra...

324
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,239
 Bridget's twin comes to stay.

325
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 Hector asks Annie on a date.

326
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,319
 And why is Bridget being so nice,

327
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,438
 or is she?

328
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:21,438
 or is she?

329
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:24,439
 or is she?

1
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,119
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,279
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,759
 Nick likes chasing girls
 and wants to be an actor.

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,719
 Bridget fancies Hector,
 but Hector only has eyes for Annie.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,919
 So how does Annie feel about that?

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
 Find out in Extra.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,838
 Well,

8
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,839
 they know I have a sister...

9
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,239
 'I'll see you on the 16th June.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,198
 'My plane lands at 3.00pm.

11
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,199
 'I'll get a taxi from the airport.
 Love you, Chrissy. '

12
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,719
 No, Mama.

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 No.

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,119
 Mothers!

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 My mother thinks I am ten years old.

16
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,159
 My mum treats me like a baby too.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
 My mum doesn't understand me.

18
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,558
 My mum doesn't understand me,

19
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,559
 but Chrissy is perfect.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 -  Who is Chrissy?
 -  She's my sister.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 Excuse me.

22
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,118
 Hi.

23
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,119
 Hello, Mother.

24
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,919
 Yes, Mother,
 I have remembered she's arriving today.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,719
 Hi, Nick.

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,758
 I've come to get my weights.

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,799
 Mr Romero.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 Take off your trousers and lie down, please.

29
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,639
 Pardon, Nick?

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 Please call me Dr Jessop.

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,278
 Dr Jessop?

32
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,279
 Hector, I want a part in the TV show
 Hospital Fever.

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,119
 I need to practise.

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
 Anyway, women love men in white coats.

35
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,598
 -  Really?
 -  So, where does it hurt?

36
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,599
 Where does what hurt?

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,679
 You are my patient,

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,958
 so you must hurt somewhere.

39
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,638
 OK...

40
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,078
 My arm.

41
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,118
 My arm hurts.

42
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,479
 Your leg or your arm?

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,119
 Leg, arm, arm, leg.

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,479
 OK.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,598
 My leg, my leg.

46
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,599
 OK. Sit down, please, Mr Romero.

47
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,279
 Cross your legs. Now...

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,398
 Don't worry, Mr Romero,

49
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,399
 this won't hurt at all.

50
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,479
 Sorry, Nick, it was an accident.

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,878
 OK.

52
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,879
 You have good reflexes.

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,598
 Good.

54
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,599
 Now, Mr Romero...

55
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,879
 please say, 'Ah.'

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,799
 I thought so.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,998
 What?

58
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,158
 You...

59
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,119
 had cornflakes for breakfast.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 Now, I must give you an injection.

61
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,678
 An injection?

62
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Yes, an injection.

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319
 It's open.

64
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,038
 Chrissy!

65
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,519
 You're early.

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,520
 Come in, come in.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,680
 Twinnies!

68
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,479
 Bridget, darling, it's lovely to see you.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,439
 And you, Chrissy.

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,678
 How was your flight?

71
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,999
 Great.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,839
 But can you believe it,

73
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,958
 they lost my luggage.

74
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,318
 Incredible.

75
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,239
 Chrissy, look at you.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 You never change. You're still a teenager.

77
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,119
 Didn't we have fun then?

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,599
 Yeah.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 At school.

80
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,239
 We shared everything.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 Yes, we did.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Anyway, here we are now.

83
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,359
 Bridget.

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,278
 Do you have some clothes I could borrow?

85
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,039
 I travelled in this dress.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 I need something more comfortable.

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,998
 Something like this?

88
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,999
 I bought two for the price of one.

89
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,478
 Bridget,

90
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,479
 this looks really good.

91
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 Great.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 Sorry, I can't exercise. I've hurt my back.

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,719
 Why, Hector,

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
 you are so muscular.

95
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
 Thanks.

96
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,199
 -  How is your mum?
 -  She is such a good friend.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
 She really understands me.

98
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,919
 But I thought that...

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,479
 It's OK.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 I'm here.

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 Where's the emergency?

102
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,479
 Well, hello, Nick.

103
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,959
 The actor.

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
 I love doctors.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Excuse me.

106
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,238
 Hello?

107
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,038
 Hello, Mummy.

108
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,078
 This is it!

109
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,678
 Women love doctors.

110
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,278
 Bridget...

111
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,878
 can't resist me.

112
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,959
 Really?

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hey, darling,

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,198
 come to Nick.

115
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,278
 See you soon, Mummy.

116
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,279
 Love you lots. Bye!

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,839
 So, Doctor...

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 Where were we?

119
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,639
 I think I have a temperature.

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 Madam, I think I can help.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 -  Tell me where it hurts.
 -  Hi, Hector.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,639
 Hi, Nick!

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,319
 Hi, Bridget.

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
 Annie, darling!

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,199
 How are you?

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 Doesn't Nick look good as a doctor?

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,159
 Yes.

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,839
 He looks very...

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 very good.

130
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,438
 Now, you must excuse me,

131
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,439
 I must do my make- up.

132
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
 Bridget is in a really strange mood today.

133
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,159
 A moment ago,
 she said that her mother was her best friend.

134
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,679
 So?

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
 But an hour ago,
 she said that her mother treated her like a baby.

136
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,359
 I am confused.

137
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 I wonder what Bridget was like
 when she was younger.

138
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,479
 I wonder what Annie was like.

139
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,079
 I wonder what Nick was like.

140
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,159
 Nick!

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 I know what Hector was like.

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,159
 Anyway...

143
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 I must continue rehearsing as Dr Jessop.

144
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 Especially as Bridget loves doctors so much.

145
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,799
 Nick only likes Bridget, Bridget, Bridget.

146
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,279
 Am I interrupting?

147
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,439
 No.

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,838
 Yes.

149
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
 Excuse me!

150
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,879
 But why?

151
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 Nick never notices me.

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 And he looks so handsome in his doctor's coat.

153
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,959
 Really?

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,759
 Sweet.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,718
 But I thought that...

156
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,998
 Your faces.

157
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,759
 Are you two...?

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 -  No.
 -  Yes.

159
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 But you look so nice together.

160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,279
 So, Hector,

161
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,280
 are you and Annie dating?

162
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,119
 Well...

163
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,118
 Come on, Hector.

164
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,078
 You can tell me.

165
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,079
 It's not a problem.

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,318
 Really?

167
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,398
 Really.

168
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,519
 OK.

169
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 I really like Annie.

170
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,799
 -  Go on.
 -  But...

171
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,239
 she doesn't notice me.

172
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,078
 Well, ask her on a date.

173
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,079
 Wow. Should I?

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,878
 OK.

175
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,879
 And, Hector...

176
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,358
 when I was at the airport today,

177
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
 I found this magazine.

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,079
 Airport?

179
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,078
 Is this you?

180
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,079
 Are you this rich boy, Hector?

181
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,279
 Yeah.

182
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
 But please don't tell Annie.

183
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,079
 You want her to like you,

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,759
 not your money.

185
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
 Yeah.

186
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 That is so sweet.

187
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,599
 Well, don't you worry.

188
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 Your secret is safe with me.

189
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,319
 Thanks.

190
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,119
 Bridget is in a really good mood today!

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,998
 Really?

192
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,999
 Great.

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,839
 Hi.

194
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,238
 Hi, Nick, darling.

195
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,239
 Or Dr Jessop.

196
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,759
 Would you help me?

197
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,438
 Sure.

198
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,439
 Would you move this exercise bike
 to give me more space?

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
 Sure.

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
 Yeah.

201
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,079
 Yeah!

202
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,239
 You're so strong.

203
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 I...need a drink.

204
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,518
 Would you...like one?

205
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,519
 Yes, please.

206
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,639
 Bridget, darling.

207
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,558
 Have you finished?

208
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
 Because now we could make a little sweet music
 of our own, darling.

209
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,279
 In your dreams, Nick.

210
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,279
 Who moved my bike?

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Well, I did, because you...

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,878
 Well, move it back, then.

213
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 If you're strong enough.

214
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,039
 Dr Romero, at your service.

215
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,759
 Hello!

216
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 Hector, you look great!

217
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 I love doctors.

218
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
 Am I interrupting?

219
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 Sweet.

220
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,639
 Would you move this exercise bike
 to give me more space?

221
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 Who moved my bike?

222
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,198
 Hi, Annie.

223
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:41,078
 Hi, Hector.

224
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,079
 Hector, think of a card.

225
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,999
 OK.

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,918
 Ace of diamonds.

227
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,919
 No, don't tell me.

228
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,478
 Annie.

229
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,479
 Yes, Hector?

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 I have something to ask you.

231
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,559
 Yes, Hector?

232
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,439
 The thing is...

233
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,919
 Would you like to come to the cinema
 tomorrow night with me?

234
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Pardon?

235
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,399
 Would you like to come to the cinema
 tomorrow night...

236
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,679
 with me?

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,359
 Well...

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,679
 Yes, I'd like to.

239
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,999
 OK.

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 See you then.

241
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,879
 So, Annie,

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,958
 did Hector ask you out?

243
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,638
 To the cinema, yes.

244
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,719
 Do you want to come?

245
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,318
 Of course not!

246
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,319
 Have a great time.

247
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,199
 I wonder which film we should see.

248
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,199
 When?

249
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 When I go to the cinema with Hector, of course.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,438
 What?

251
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,439
 You and Hector are going to the cinema?

252
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,119
 I don't believe it!

253
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,319
 I'm starving.

254
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,919
 These are my favourite biscuits.

255
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,479
 I think there are some good films on now,
 Annie.

256
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,119
 All the films are rubbish at the moment anyway.

257
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,919
 I'm starving.

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
 I hate these biscuits.

259
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 Now, I must phone the airport.

260
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,238
 What is it, Annie?

261
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,239
 I don't understand.

262
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 If you are there,

263
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,959
 then who is in the bathroom?

264
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 Annie, what are you doing?

265
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,319
 But you're...

266
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,078
 -  You're...
 -  Twins.

267
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,079
 Bridget, I didn't know!

268
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,478
 This is my twin sister Chrissy.

269
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,479
 Didn't I tell you about her?

270
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Now I understand.

271
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,518
 So Nick and Hector

272
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,999
 don't know that you are twins?

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,398
 No, I don't think so.

274
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,518
 You know,

275
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,519
 we could have some fun with this...

276
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 Maybe a magic trick?

277
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,998
 Hector, Nick, come in.

278
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,999
 You are just in time to see my new magic trick.

279
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,879
 Take a seat.

280
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,318
 Wow, I can't wait.

281
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,319
 Ladies and gentlemen.

282
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,199
 Just gentlemen.

283
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 Today I will make my lovely assistant Bridget
 disappear!

284
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560
 Enter, Bridget!

285
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,399
 OK, Bridget, in you go.

286
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,358
 Bridget.

287
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,359
 Bridget!

288
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,679
 I will make Bridget disappear from this box
 and appear in this box.

289
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,158
 This I must see.

290
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,159
 Now a tap with the magic wand.

291
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,839
 Which means that the first box is empty.

292
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,398
 Bridget, you are moving quickly today.

293
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,399
 Let's just check that the other box is empty.

294
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,958
 She's going round the back.

295
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,959
 OK, gentlemen, place your bets, please.

296
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,479
 Which box do you think Bridget is in?

297
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 -  The box on the left.
 -  No, the box on the right.

298
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,838
 OK. Let's see.

299
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,839
 A drum roll, please.

300
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 Gentlemen, applause, please, for...

301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Bridget and Chrissy!

302
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:34,199
 I think there's something wrong
 with the audience.

303
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,079
 Is there a doctor in the house?

304
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120
 Bye, Chrissy. Come back again soon.

305
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,478
 I will, I promise.

306
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,479
 Bye, Bridget.

307
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 Chrissy, I'll miss you.

308
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,399
 She forgot her magazine.

309
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,718
 What?

310
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,518
 It can't be!

311
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,799
 It is.

312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 It's Hector.

313
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,799
 Next time in Extra...

314
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,279
 Hector helps build some new shelves.

315
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
 Nick helps build some new shelves.

316
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 And what happens when the landlady's cousin
 comes to stay?

317
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:33,679
 And what happens when the landlady's cousin
 comes to stay?

1
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,439
 This is the story of two girls
 who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,439
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
 Bridget is interested in Hector

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 but Hector is very interested in Annie.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,438
 Annie doesn't know.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,439
 So will he get close enough to tell her?

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 Find out in Extra.

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,438
 'Dear tenants,

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
 'my cousin, your landlady,
 is on holiday this week,

10
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,759
 'so I am in charge.

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,839
 'The same rules apply.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 'No pets, no parties, no visitors, especially boys.

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,079
 'Yours, Eunice Mountain.'

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,080
 Eunice Mountain? She sounds terrible.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,358
 Worse than the tarantula.

16
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,999
 If that's possible.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Do you think she'll say no shelves?

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
 She can't. They'll look fantastic.

19
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,199
 'The timber shelves
 in clear lacquered beech veneer...'

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,678
 'With six casters...'

21
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,679
 'And a TV bench.'

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 Now, where shall we begin?

23
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,958
 Annie, it's easy.

24
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,959
 Rule number one.
 Always read the instructions first.

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
 Well, that will only take a week.

26
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,279
 OK, let's have a drink before we begin.

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,039
 -  Milk, Annie?
 -  Yes, please.

28
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,078
 'I owe you, Nick.'

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,079
 There! Well, no milk.
 Would you like some sparkling water?

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
 Right.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 'I owe you, Nick.'

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 'I owe you, Nick.'

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,758
 'I owe you, Nick.'

34
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,759
 How dare he?

35
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,279
 -  Would you like some cola?
 -  Thanks, Bridget, I was looking for that.

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,638
 Nick!

37
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,639
 Sorry.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 Add it to the list.

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
 Or ask your flatmate to buy your food.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,358
 Wow!

41
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,359
 -  You didn't know Hector was rich?
 -  No.

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 I'll speak to you later.

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,918
 Wow.

44
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,759
 What are all these boxes?

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,679
 Our new shelves, Hector.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
 I can help you build them.
 Where are the instructions?

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,038
 Hector, my friend, rule number one.

48
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,039
 Never read the instructions.

49
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,479
 I see you have a note
 from our new landlady, then.

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,279
 Eunice Mountain.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
 Eunice Mountain. I bet she's the same size.

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,880
 Hello. It's Eunice Mountain.

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
 Who am I? I'm Nick, from Flat B.

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
 You want Flat A? This is...

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 Hello. Yes, this is Flat A.

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 Yes, I am Nick from Flat B.

57
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,879
 Yes, I know this isn't my flat.

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 I want to see you downstairs now.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Sorry. OK. Right away.

60
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,799
 Well?

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 Eunice Mountain
 wants to see me downstairs now.

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,038
 Bad luck, man.

63
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,119
 Oh, dear.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
 Ask her if she has any milk, bread and biscuits.

65
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,718
 OK, so...

66
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,719
 'First open box A
 and take out shelf number one.'

67
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,399
 But which is box A?

68
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,438
 This is box C.

69
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,439
 And I've got box D.

70
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,640
 I've got it. This is shelf number one.

71
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,639
 No, Hector. This is shelf number one.

72
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,519
 No, this is shelf number one.

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
 This is a nightmare.

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 OK, Annie, read out the instructions.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 'Put shelf one against the wall.'

76
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,479
 Hector, I think the books will fall off.

77
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,279
 So what's Eunice Mountain like?

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,478
 You know, not bad.

79
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,478
 Are you in trouble?

80
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,799
 Probably.

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,278
 I've got it.

82
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,279
 'Put pole B on the left and pole A on the right

83
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,399
 'and the shelf on top.' Bridget.

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 Like this, Hector?

85
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,479
 Have you put up shelves before, Hector?

86
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,319
 Many times.

87
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,999
 Or do your servants do it for you?

88
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,839
 -  I'll do it!
 -  No, no, no, I'll do it.

89
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
 Drop! Drop!

90
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:21,119
 I laugh at instructions.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,038
 That was clever.

92
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,039
 It's OK. I can straighten it.

93
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 Stand back and watch the master at work.

94
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
 Well done, Nick.

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
 So where does this piece go?

96
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,518
 Hi.

97
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,519
 I'm Eunice Mountain, your new landlady.

98
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
 Wow!

99
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 Hi.

100
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 Hello. I...

101
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,359
 I am Bridget

102
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,958
 and this is Annie.

103
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,999
 Hello.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And this is Hector from Argentina.

105
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
 Well, hello, Hector.

106
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,319
 Hector lives next door with Nick.

107
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 I've met Nick already, haven't I, Nick?

108
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,559
 Yes, that's right.

109
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 We need to talk about your rent. In private.

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 Great.

111
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,479
 'Measure the distance between the shelves.'

112
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 Annie, hold this, please.

113
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,119
 That's it.

114
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,120
 And this should be it.

115
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,919
 Hector, do you think that's correct?

116
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,559
 These shelves are for mice.

117
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 Can I speak to you please, Hector?

118
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,558
 So, Hector.

119
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,559
 'One of the richest families
 in Argentina, the Romero family.'

120
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 There you are, Hector.

121
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
 So why the secret?

122
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 Because I wanted you to like me,
 not my money.

123
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
 Oh, Hector, of course I do.

124
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,878
 Who else knows?

125
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,198
 Nick.

126
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,039
 I thought so.

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
 But not Annie. Don't tell Annie...yet.

128
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,918
 Why, Hector?

129
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,478
 Because, Bridget...

130
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:44,039
 -  Because...
 -  Yes?

131
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
 I am in love with Annie.

132
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 Nick has entered the building.

133
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
 So where are you going,
 looking like John Travolta?

134
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 He has a date with me, haven't you, darling?

135
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,998
 Another date?

136
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,999
 But that's three times this week.

137
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,718
 Four.

138
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,719
 We've been to dinner,
 to the theatre, to the cinema

139
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,559
 and last night...salsa dancing.

140
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,879
 Can you salsa?

141
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 I am the salsa queen.

142
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,879
 Yeah, with two left feet.

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,398
 -  Pardon?
 -  Nothing.

144
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,358
 It sounds great.

145
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,359
 What is it tonight? Ping- pong?

146
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Tonight's it's karaoke.

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,518
 And I am the karaoke queen.

148
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,318
 Let's go. Bye.

149
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,319
 I love you!

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 I am the karaoke queen.

151
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,639
 I bet she sings like a toad.

152
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 So, Hector, where were we?

153
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
 OK, I think I've got it, Annie.

154
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 I did knock, but the music was so loud,
 you didn't hear me.

155
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 I thought we'd have a little chat.

156
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 Rule number two. No underwear on the radiator.

157
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,558
 It's dry now.

158
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,559
 Give it to me. Give it to...

159
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,479
 Thank you.

160
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,319
 Let me repeat the rules.

161
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
 No parties and no visitors.

162
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,799
 Especially boys.

163
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 Especially boys from next door.

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 Especially Nick.

165
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 He's mine.

166
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,998
 Get the message?

167
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,999
 Yeah, we get the message.

168
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,079
 See you later.

169
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 By the way, that shelf is not straight.

170
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,639
 Bye.

171
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,518
 Well, I have never...

172
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,519
 What does she... Who does she think she is?

173
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,799
 The landlady's cousin?

174
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 I know that, but no Hector and no Nick?

175
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,359
 How dare she?

176
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,479
 How is Eunice?

177
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 Problems?

178
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 She is very nice.

179
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,318
 But?

180
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:25,319
 But she's just not my type.

181
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,759
 What do you mean?

182
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 Look. Presents.

183
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,519
 More presents. Flowers.
 More presents. Chocolate.

184
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,839
 And her energy. I'm exhausted.

185
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
 Nick?

186
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,878
 Let's go dancing.

187
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,879
 Hector, get rid of her!

188
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,158
 Get rid of her? How?

189
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,159
 -  Say something.
 -  What shall I say?

190
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
 Anything! Tell her I'm not well.

191
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,039
 I've eaten a hedgehog. I've gone to the moon.

192
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,959
 Nick, are you in there?

193
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
 -  Go on!
 -  OK.

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,438
 Hi.

195
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
 You're not Nick.

196
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 No. Nick's hedgehog has gone to the moon.

197
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,839
 Pardon?

198
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 Nick's hedgehog is not well. Nick is sad.

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,798
 So he must come dancing to make him happy.

200
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,799
 No! He cannot dance!

201
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,919
 Why not?

202
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920
 He stood on the hedgehog without shoes.
 Very painful.

203
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
 Oh! Very messy.

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,438
 So he cannot dance.

205
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,439
 Oh, that's a pity.

206
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,039
 Well, never mind.

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,040
 Yeah, sorry. Bye.

208
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,198
 -  You'll just have to come instead.
 -  Pardon?

209
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,199
 Come on, let's dance.

210
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
 Do you think that's correct?

211
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
 'And tighten the screws.'

212
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,479
 Annie, you are a genius.

213
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,319
 -  Hi, Hector.
 -  Hi, Annie.

214
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,320
 What's the matter? Are you OK?

215
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,479
 I am exhausted.

216
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,278
 What happened?

217
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,279
 -  Last night Eunice and I...
 -  Yes?

218
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,880
 -  She made me...
 -  Yes?

219
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,440
 ..go dancing.

220
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
 Annie, she dances like a rhinoceros.

221
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,759
 Wow!

222
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,118
 Annie! The shelves!

223
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,158
 You finished them!

224
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,678
 Oh, just a bit more measuring.

225
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,679
 I will help you.

226
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 -  Sorry.
 -  No, sorry.

227
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,398
 Sorry.

228
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,399
 It's OK.
 It happens when people work together.

229
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
 So, where were we?

230
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
 'For the final shelf, take...'

231
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,079
 Hector!

232
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 Help! Hide me!

233
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,278
 -  Eunice?
 -  Eunice.

234
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,159
 Oh, Bridget, save me.

235
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,160
 -  Why?
 -  It's Eunice.

236
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 Nick? Oh, Nick.

237
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,639
 There she is. She's too much.

238
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,319
 I know you are in there, Nick.

239
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 Bridget, Annie, I said no boys.

240
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,919
 Shall I get rid of her, Nick?

241
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 Yes, please. But how?

242
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,359
 I'll think of something.
 Annie, let Miss Mountain in.

243
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There you are, Nick.

244
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,319
 And Hector.

245
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,799
 Bridget, I thought I said no boys.

246
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,519
 Yes, you did.

247
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
 Especially boys from next door.

248
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,079
 Yes. Yes, you did.

249
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080
 -  Especially...
 -  Nick. He's mine.

250
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,239
 Oh, Nick!

251
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Well, I... Just wait until I tell my cousin.

252
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 By the way, Hector, I've got a fax for you.

253
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,079
 Please, give it to me.

254
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,878
 It's from your father. It says...

255
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,879
 'Coming to London to meet...
 the Prime Minister?

256
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,599
 'My jet arrives at midday. Will phone. Father.'

257
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,119
 Actually, Hector, I think you're more my type.

258
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,119
 I don't think so, Eunice.

259
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,039
 -  Goodbye.
 -  And don't slam the...door.

260
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,359
 So, Hector, your father is flying to London
 in his private jet to meet the Prime Minister?

261
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 Well, they are one of the richest families
 in Argentina.

262
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,999
 -  So, Bridget, where were we?
 -  No, Nick.

263
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,999
 The trick worked. Eunice has gone.

264
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,719
 Annie, I will buy you a million shelves.

265
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
 Well, we'd better
 start measuring for them, then.

266
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,278
 Next time in Extra...

267
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,158
 Nick dresses up.

268
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,998
 Bridget is working hard in television.

269
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,999
 And Hector goes for an audition.

270
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:55,998
 And Hector goes for an audition.

1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,680
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
 Hector and Annie are dating

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,559
 and Hector's English
 is getting better and better.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,519
 Nick fancies Bridget

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,520
 but...well, Bridget does not fancy Nick.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,799
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 To be or not to be,

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
 that is the question. Whe...

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,840
 Oh, no!

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Why is it so dark in here? What's going on?

12
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,799
 Nick, what are you doing?
 The sun is shining outside.

13
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,719
 Hi, Annie.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 -  What are you doing?
 -  Nothing.

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,319
 -  Well, stand up, then.
 -  I can't.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,878
 Why not?

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,879
 -  Right, I'm coming over.
 -  OK.

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
 OK.

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,718
 Nice outfit, Nick!

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,719
 Bridget, look at this!

21
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,879
 You can laugh

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
 but one day I will be a great actor.

23
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,999
 In fact, I might get a part
 in a Shakespeare production this week.

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,438
 In your dreams!

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,638
 Did you have a good day at work, Bridget?

26
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,639
 I'm so tired.

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,160
 Training with the England
 football team this morning.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
 Those boys...so cheeky!

29
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,319
 But they really know
 what they're talking about.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,759
 Football?

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 No. Hairstyles and fashion, of course.

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 Anyway, then I had lunch
 with Kylie Minogue's agent...lovely man.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 -  So funny! I'm exhausted.
 -  Poor Bridget.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 I must get changed.

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 Now Bridget's a researcher for Channel 9,
 all she talks about is sweet stars.

36
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,559
 It's so boring.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 I'll be sweet when I'm famous.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,560
 Where are they?

39
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
 I thought so.

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
 To die...to sleep...

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 -  Nick!
 -  No more...

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 -  Are those my tights?
 -  No.

43
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,958
 Yes, they are!

44
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,798
 These tights! Are they yours, Bridget?

45
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,799
 I'll speak to you later.
 Now, where's Hector?

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,280
 I have some exciting news for him.

47
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,038
 Hi, Bridget.

48
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,638
 Hi, sugar plum!

49
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,639
 Hi, snuggly puppykins!

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 Nice tights, man!

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 Hector, I have some great news for you.

52
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,599
 Channel 9 is looking
 for a television reporter.

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,839
 I can do that!

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,840
 Not an English reporter.
 A Latin American who speaks English.

55
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,999
 -  But I can't speak English very well.
 -  Just audition.

56
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,239
 Go on, Hector, the camera will love you.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 And so will the girls!

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,239
 Not all the girls, I hope.

59
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
 Well, if you think so, then...

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 Hector, with my help, the job is yours.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 And my new boss
 will be very impressed with me.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,799
 OK, Bridget.

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 Right! Let's do some research.

64
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,159
 Annie, we need CNN. Find it. And, Nick?

65
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 -  Yes?
 -  I want my tights back...now.

66
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,479
 OK.

67
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,558
 You want your tights back?

68
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,959
 They are Versace.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
 The remote, please, Annie.

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 Alas, poor Yorick.

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,639
 I knew him, Horatio.

72
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,278
 What's wrong with it?

73
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,279
 I don't know. I think it's broken.

74
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 Well, we'll have to go to your place, then.

75
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,479
 There you are.

76
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,158
 We're watching CNN.

77
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,159
 We're doing research for Hector's new job.

78
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,639
 Hector's new job? What about my new job?
 I need to do research as well.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 Nick!

80
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,758
 There! That's better.

81
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,158
 To be or not to be...

82
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,159
 -  What's this?
 -  Hamlet. A tragedy.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,398
 What's it about?

84
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,399
 Love, madness and murder.

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 Hamlet's father, the king,
 is killed by Hamlet's uncle,

86
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,719
 who then marries...

87
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:09,959
 Hamlet's mother,

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
 so Hamlet kills his uncle and his mother

89
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,399
 and then...he dies.

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,318
 That sounds like my family.

91
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,919
 It's a masterpiece.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 I'd be great as Hamlet.

93
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,158
 My tights!

94
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,159
 Bridget, I had an accident.

95
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,599
 Buy me another pair
 or you will have an accident!

96
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,319
 Accident or murder?

97
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,679
 OK, Bridget.

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,798
 Right, I'm off.

99
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,799
 Me too.

100
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 -  Good night, sugar plum.
 -  Night, snuggly puppykins.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,279
 Nick, I am worried.

102
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 Hector, I know what you mean.

103
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,599
 When women talk like that,
 it is time to move on.

104
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,239
 No, not Annie. This television reporter's job.

105
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,279
 I don't really think I can do it.

106
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
 Hector, of course you can.

107
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,519
 What you need is...

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
 -  Talent?
 -  No! You don't need talent.

109
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,079
 You need Nick's School
 For Television Reporters.

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Nick's School For Television Reporters?

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 Yeah! I will teach you
 to be a television reporter.

112
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,238
 -  OK!
 -  OK.

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,759
 Rule number one.

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 Imagine you are talking
 to a beautiful woman.

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
 Good evening, this is Nick Jessop

116
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,079
 reporting from the Houses of Parliament
 just for you.

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
 Rule number two. Be mysterious.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I am here to tell you
 the Houses of Parliament may look normal,

119
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,879
 but all is not as it seems.

120
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,478
 Rule number three.

121
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,479
 Make them trust you.

122
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,599
 I can reveal that this building

123
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 is actually an alien space station.

124
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,639
 Trust me. Trust Nick Jessop.

125
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,159
 I will always tell you the truth.

126
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,599
 See you later. Good night and...sleep tight.

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 Do it like that, Hector,
 and you will get the job.

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
 Hi, this is Hector Romero.

129
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
 Well, if you think so.

130
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,319
 OK, Bridget.

131
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,239
 These tights!

132
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
 To die...to sleep...

133
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Nick's School For Television Reporters.

134
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,039
 Did you get my fax?

135
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 Well, did you get my email?

136
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,079
 What did Sting say?
 Will he do the interview?

137
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,919
 You won't even ask him?

138
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,079
 He's never heard of Channel 9?

139
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 Please! Please!

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,798
 Please!

141
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,799
 Well, can I meet him?

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,798
 I can?

143
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,598
 Where is he?

144
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,599
 At the airport? I'll be there.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,998
 Yes!

146
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,758
 Hector Romero for you, Bridget.

147
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,238
 No.

148
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,239
 Hector, I forgot your audition.

149
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 Listen, I must go out for one hour.
 Sting wants to see me.

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,758
 Don't worry.

151
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,558
 Just remember everything I've told you.

152
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,559
 Here's the script, there's the camera.

153
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,758
 Must dash! Be back in an hour!

154
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,759
 But...

155
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,279
 Hello. This is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,478
 What a day!

157
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,479
 First Sting had already departed
 for New York and now this!

158
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,719
 This! From you, Hector!

159
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,158
 Sorry, Bridget.

160
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
 Was this Nick's idea?

161
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,039
 I thought so.

162
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
 So, have I got the job?

163
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,599
 What do you think?

164
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Goodbye, Hector.

165
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:36,319
 And the new editor will be here soon.

166
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,519
 Right! Nick!

167
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,999
 'Nick, I am too angry to speak. Bridget.'

168
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,318
 -  Hi, Bridget!
 -  Nick.

169
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,758
 I thought you were too angry
 to speak to me.

170
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,759
 Shut up, Nick. How dare you?

171
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,958
 How dare I what?

172
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
 Teach Hector to be a news reporter!

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
 -  Sorry, Bridget.
 -  He was ridiculous.

174
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,239
 'Hi, sexy, this is Hector Romero.'

175
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,919
 My new editor will be here soon
 and I wanted to impress her.

176
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,079
 So will Hector get the job, then?

177
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,279
 Of course he won't get the job.
 You made me look a fool.

178
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,799
 You...you and Hector are so stupid!

179
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,919
 Who was that?

180
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
 -  Wrong number.
 -  Nick, look at this.

181
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,079
 -  This could be perfect for you.
 -  What is it?

182
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,279
 'Is Shakespeare in your blood?
 Could you be our Hamlet?'

183
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,878
 Yeah!

184
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,599
 -  'Do you love performing?'
 -  Yeah!

185
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,958
 -  'Do you love travelling?'
 -  Yeah!

186
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,959
 -  'Do people adore you?'
 -  Naturally!

187
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 'Then we need you. Call this number
 for a Shakespearean experience.'

188
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,118
 Hamlet!

189
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,119
 My dream!

190
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,079
 I'll call now.

191
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
 I must learn my lines.

192
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,319
 To be...

193
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
 To be...

194
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
 Or not to be?

195
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 Hello, Bridget.

196
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,439
 Eunice! What are you doing here?

197
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 Long time no see, Bridget.

198
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 And how's Nick? Does he miss me?

199
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
 No... Yes.

200
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 You have a new hairstyle.

201
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:26,439
 Yeah. So have you.

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 Yes, but the difference is mine looks good.

203
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,679
 Yes.

204
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
 Anyway, Bridget,

205
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
 I am your new editor.

206
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,199
 Surprised?

207
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 No...no...no.

208
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,358
 Good.

209
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,359
 OK. Two rules.

210
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 One. I am your editor and I am always right.

211
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
 Two. You are the researcher,
 you are always wrong. OK?

212
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,558
 OK.

213
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,559
 Now, what have you got for me today?

214
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 Well, Sting would love
 to come for an interview but...

215
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,479
 But is not coming.

216
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,518
 No.

217
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,519
 But we need a new reporter and...

218
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,479
 and...

219
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 and I have found you
 the most perfect person.

220
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,399
 He's Latin American, speaks English
 and he's very sexy.

221
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,199
 Watch this. I know you'll love him.

222
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Hi, sexy. This is Hector Romero
 for Channel 9.

223
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 Wow, you look beautiful today.

224
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
 Guess what. There's been
 a diamond robbery in London.

225
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,319
 I would love to put diamonds
 on those pretty ears.

226
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,119
 But you, yes, you can sleep safely
 in your bed tonight.

227
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 This is Hector Romero.

228
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 I'll be back.

229
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,239
 Well?

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 Of course! Hector! He is perfect!

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
 Hello, this is Hector Romero for Channel 9.

232
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 Right! Nick!

233
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,399
 I am your new editor.

234
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,399
 He is perfect!

235
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,119
 My dream!

236
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,159
 Don't worry, Hector, my little puppykins.

237
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
 I'm sure you would have been
 a very good reporter.

238
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 But Bridget is angry with me.

239
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 Don't worry about Bridget.

240
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 Guess what. I've got the job.

241
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,438
 -  Hamlet?
 -  Shakespeare?

242
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,439
 Congratulations, man!

243
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,558
 Great! When do you start?

244
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,559
 Tonight. I've got the costume already.

245
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 I think I will go and wash my motorbike.

246
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,079
 You haven't got a motorbike.

247
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 -  I have now.
 -  Hi, everyone!

248
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 Hector, you have a visitor.

249
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,439
 My new editor.

250
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,519
 Eunice, do you remember Hector?

251
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,839
 How could I forget?

252
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
 And...of course...Nick!

253
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,678
 I could never forget you!

254
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,679
 I thought you had a motorbike to wash.

255
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,919
 Thank you.

256
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,719
 Hector,

257
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 I just popped in to say congratulations.

258
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,038
 You've got the job!

259
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,078
 Isn't it wonderful?

260
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,479
 Eunice really liked your tape.

261
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 -  You are perfect, Hector.
 -  Hector will have such fun.

262
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
 I'm off. See you at eight o'clock sharp
 tomorrow morning, Hector.

263
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,279
 There's no need to thank me, Hector.

264
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,479
 I think I've got something in my eye.

265
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 Well, it was nice while it lasted

266
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,079
 but now, Annie, it is time
 to say goodbye to Hector.

267
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:23,199
 He is going to be a famous news reporter,

268
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,239
 so there'll be no room for little old you.

269
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,318
 It's OK, Annie.

270
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,319
 Whatever happens,
 we will always be together.

271
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,840
 But you'll forget me
 when you're a famous news reporter.

272
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
 However many stories I report,

273
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 murders, bank robberies, small cats in trees,

274
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,959
 I shall never forget you.

275
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
 You, light of my life.

276
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 This is Hector Romero
 for Channel 9, London.

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,039
 Oh, Hector!

278
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,118
 Oh, Annie!

279
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,119
 Oh, no.

280
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 -  Nick?
 -  Yes? No!

281
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 'To eat or not to eat,

282
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,439
 'that is the question.

283
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,519
 'Hamlet's burgers,
 eat them without question.'

284
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,798
 Next time in Extra...

285
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,799
 Annie wants to save the animals.

286
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,959
 Bridget has a date with Leonardo DiCaprio.
