1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,002
Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story ;

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,263
the story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:10,551
Are we being punished for something ?

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,173
No.

5
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,059
Yeah, is this gonna take a while ?

6
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,950
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,083
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,796
It was way back in 2005.

9
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:27,584
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect

10
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:30,482
and living in New York  with Marshall,  my best friend from college.

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:31,708
My life was good.

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,508
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,112
Will you marry me ?

14
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:38,937
Yes. Perfect !

15
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,008
And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:41,756
You drink a toast.

17
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,593
You have sex on the kitchen floor.

18
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:45,406
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

19
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,110
Got it.

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,585
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

21
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,906
Dude, are you kidding ?
It's you and Lilly.

22
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,378
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lilly :

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,838
night you met, your first date, other first things.

24
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:59,642
Yeah, sorry.
We thought you were asleep.

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,699
It's physics, Marshall.

26
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,445
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.

27
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,027
My God.

28
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,762
You're getting engaged tonight.

29
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:12,260
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight ?

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,168
What was I doing ?

31
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,741
Here Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.

32
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,611
And me ?

33
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,572
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.

34
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,858
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls ?

35
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,965
Well, now I've got a new favorite... Lebanese girls.

36
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,148
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

37
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,111
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight ?

38
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,218
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes. And suit up !

39
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:40,213
Where's your suit ?

40
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,841
Just once, when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.

41
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,594
I did that one time.

42
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,747
It was a blazer !

43
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,014
You know, ever since college it's been, Marshall and Lilly and me.

44
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,855
Now, it's gonna be Marshall and Lilly... and me.

45
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,508
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:01:55,508 --> 00:02:00,124
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.

47
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,545
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,871
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met ?

49
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,498
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

50
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,098
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:14,460
Oh, right. Right.

52
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Lesson one : lose the goatee.

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,618
It doesn't go with your suit.

54
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:20,311
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two : get a suit.

55
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,127
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "A."

56
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:27,140
Lesson three : don't even think about getting married till you're 30.

57
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,410
30. Right. You're right.

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,224
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged,

59
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,478
you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,151
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,469
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,486
You're my best friend, Barney.

63
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,354
Good. Then, as your best friend,

64
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,163
I suggest we play a little game I like to call

65
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,235
- "Have you met Ted ?"
- Wait. No, no, no.

66
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,337
We're not playing "Have you met Ted ?"

67
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,739
Hi, have you met Ted ?

68
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,817
Hi, I'm Ted.

69
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,701
Yasmine.

70
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,972
That's a very pretty name.

71
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,779
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

72
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,397
I'm exhausted.

73
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,024
It was finger-painting day at school,

74
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:05,731
and a five year-old boy got to second base with me.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,690
Wow ! You're cooking ?

76
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,346
Yes, I am.

77
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:11,447
Aw...

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,996
Are you sure that's a good idea ?

79
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,078
After last time, you looked really creepy without eyebrows.

80
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:18,431
I can handle this.

81
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,697
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.

82
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,018
So, there's more surprises ?
Like what ?

83
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,064
Marshall was in his second year of law school,

84
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,435
so he was pretty good  at thinking on his feet.

85
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,731
Boogedyboo !

86
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,481
And that's all of 'em.

87
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,033
I'm gonna go... cook.

88
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,437
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

89
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:38,611
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.

90
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,190
So, do you think you'll ever get married ?

91
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,041
Well, maybe eventually...

92
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,150
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.

93
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,757
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

94
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,842
Band, no DJ.
People will dance !

95
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:51,517
I'm not gonna worry about it !

96
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,857
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged ?

97
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,773
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh ?

98
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,279
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

99
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,129
One more for the lady !

100
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,783
Oh, hey, look what I got.

101
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,597
Oh, honey ! Champagne.

102
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,638
Yeah.

103
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,910
No. You are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,550
- I'm not scared.
- Then open it.

105
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,591
Fine.

106
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,342
Please open it ?

107
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,554
You are unbelievable, Marshall.

108
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:31,062
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.

109
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,764
One, you plan out for months.

110
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,604
The other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.

111
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:36,934
Will you marry me ?

112
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,284
You wanna go out sometime ?

113
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,856
Of course, you idiot !

114
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,495
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

115
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,024
'Sup, Carl ?

116
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,142
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

117
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,759
Did you know there's a Pop Tart under your fridge ?

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,347
No, but dibs.

119
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,882
Where's that champagne ?

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,876
I wanna drink a toast with my fianc�e.

121
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,574
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

122
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,496
It's pretty easy, right ?

123
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,640
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden ?

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,910
This is crazy.
I'm not ready to settle down.

125
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,340
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl ?

126
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,431
The plan has always been don't even think about it until you're 30.

127
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,567
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

128
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:29,002
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

129
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,068
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...

130
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,544
but if I was, it's, like, "Okay, I'm ready. Where is she ?"

131
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,486
And there she was.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,041
It was like something from an old movie,

133
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,278
where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor,

134
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,091
turns to his buddy and says, "See that girl ?

135
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,139
I'm gonna marry her someday."

136
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,941
Hey, Barney, see that girl ?

137
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,721
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

138
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,295
Go say hi.

139
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,159
I can't just go say hi.

140
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,374
I need a plan.

141
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,415
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom,

142
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,359
then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...

143
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,764
Hi, have you met Ted ?

144
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:20,393
Let me guess... Ted.

145
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,253
Sorry, Lilly.
I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,445
- Take us to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

147
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,708
Did you hit her ?

148
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:31,902
Hit me ? Please !

149
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,810
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.

150
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,370
He's all like, "Oh, honey. Did that hurt ?"

151
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,040
And, I'm like, "Come on !
Let me have it, you pansy !"

152
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,516
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, no ! It's okay.

153
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,386
Go on.

154
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,449
So, these, uh, spankings...

155
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,309
you in pajamas or au naturel ?

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,643
So, what do you do ?

157
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,893
Well, kind of a reporter.

159
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,251
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.

160
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,678
You know, like, um...

161
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,185
monkey who can play the ukulele.

162
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,277
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.

163
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:06,958
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla with an upright bass ?

164
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,292
Sorry. You're really pretty.

165
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,743
Oh, your friends don't seem to happy.

166
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,901
Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.

167
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,397
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

168
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:20,869
You know if it'll make your friend feel better,

169
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,992
you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.

170
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,914
She would love that !

171
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,247
And it does look fun in the movies.

172
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,427
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night ?

173
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:30,632
Oh, I can't.

174
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,651
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

175
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,003
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.

176
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,497
Guess who's covering it ?

177
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,587
That's gonna take a week ?

178
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,533
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

179
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,996
Hey ! What's takin' so long ?

180
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,550
Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how 'bout tomorrow night ?

181
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,317
Yeah. What the hell ?

182
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,557
Jerk !

183
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,764
That was fun.

184
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:01,738
De... wait for it... nied !

185
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,143
Denied !

186
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,836
We're goin' out tomorrow night.

187
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:07,238
I thought we were playin' laser tag tomorrow night.

188
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,716
Yeah, I was never gonna go play laser tag.

189
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,079
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.

190
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,673
That is one badass blue French horn.

191
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:20,298
Yeah.

192
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,987
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

193
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,609
Son, a piece of advice :

194
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:29,064
when you go on a first date, you really don't wanna say "Smurf penis."

195
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,499
Girls don't ordinarily like that.

196
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,887
But this was no ordinary girl.

197
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,311
Lilly ?

198
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,968
How long have you been sitting there ?

199
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,875
Stupid eye patch.

200
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:52,395
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

201
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,677
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman ?

202
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,432
Now, let's see... she likes dogs ?

203
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,905
I've got five dogs.

204
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,798
She drinks scotch ?

205
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,680
I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,679
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters ?

207
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,402
Ray ! When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "Yes !"

208
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,664
And I'm saving the best for last.

209
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:14,112
Do you want these ?
I hate olives.

210
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,052
She hates olives ! Awesome !

211
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,822
The olive theory.

212
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,598
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshall and Lilly.

213
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,281
He hates olives, she loves them.

214
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,138
In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.

215
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,612
Perfect balance.

216
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:30,487
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.

217
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,591
I could take 'em off your hands.

218
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,339
They're all yours.

219
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,412
Oh, it is on !

220
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,076
It is on till the break of dawn.

221
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:43,476
But wait.

222
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,001
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened ?

223
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,034
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.

224
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,800
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.

225
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,057
- No green clarinet ?
- Nope.

226
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,588
Come on. No purple tuba ?

227
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,635
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

228
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:58,833
There you are !

229
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,931
We got a jumper.

230
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,845
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

231
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,386
Come on. You're coverin' it !

232
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,149
Um... all right.
I'll be right there.

233
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,477
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,330
I had a really great time tonight.

235
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,404
Yeah.

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,394
So ?! Did you kiss her ?

237
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,563
No. The moment wasn't right.

238
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,807
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.

239
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,320
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

240
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,030
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.

241
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,461
So you chickened out like a little bitch.

242
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,163
What ? I did not chicken out.

243
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:30,798
You know what ?

244
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,423
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate

245
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,456
who hasn't been single since the first week of college.

246
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,026
Anyone who's single would tell you the same thing,

247
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,530
even the dumbest single person alive.

248
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,939
And if you don't believe me, call him.

249
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,462
Hey, loser.

250
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,605
How's not playing laser tag ?

251
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,873
Because playing laser tag is awesome !

252
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,625
- Oh, I killed you, Conner !
- Don't make me get your mom !

253
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,698
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion on something.

254
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,251
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

255
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,332
And suit up !

256
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,657
So, these guys think I chickened out.

257
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:00,758
What do you think ?

258
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:04,549
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.

259
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,898
She didn't even give me the signal.

260
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,752
What, is she gonna, she gonna bat her eyes ayou in Morse code ?

261
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,724
"Ted... kiss me."
No ! You just kiss her !

262
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,725
Not if you don't get the signal.

263
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,320
Did Marshall give me the signal ?

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,713
No ! I didn't. I swear.

265
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:26,651
But, see, at least tonight,

266
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,199
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

267
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:28,979
never gonna happen.

268
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,245
You should have kissed her.

269
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,275
Oh, I should have kissed her.

270
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,367
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.

271
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,627
A week ? That's like a year in hot girl time.

272
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:37,837
She'll forget all about you.

273
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:41,158
Mark my words... you will never see that one again.

274
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,756
There she is.

275
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,791
Ooh ! She's cute.
Hey, Carl, turn it up.

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,750
...persuaded him to reconsider.

277
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,807
At which point, the man came down off the ledge,

278
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,690
giving this bizarre story a happy ending.

279
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,116
- Reporting from Metro One News...
- Guy didn't jump.

280
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,066
I'm gonna go kiss her.

281
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,202
Right now.

282
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,582
Look, dude.
It's midnight.

283
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:04,323
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freakin' crazy.

284
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,801
I never do anything crazy.

285
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,334
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.

286
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,704
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

287
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,197
This may be the only moment I'm gonna get.

288
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,038
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.

289
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,727
I gotta take the leap !

290
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,905
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

291
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,404
'cause for me it's fall in love and get married,

292
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,444
and for him it's... death.

293
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,046
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

294
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,710
By the way, did I congratulate you two ?

295
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,773
I'm doing this.

296
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:29,977
Let's go.

297
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,730
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

298
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:33,533
Barney ?

299
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,141
All right, but under one condition.

300
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,147
Look at you, you beautiful bastard. You suited up !

301
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,913
This is totally going in my blog !

302
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:44,859
Stop the car.

303
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,296
Uh, pull over right here.

304
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,090
I gotta do something.

305
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,895
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.

306
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,512
Enjoy your coffee.

307
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,043
Go ! Go ! Go !

308
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,615
Everybody brings flowers.

309
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,056
Okay.

310
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,254
Moment of truth.

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,196
Wish me luck.

312
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,998
Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

313
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:19,443
"This just in." Okay.

314
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,303
Kiss her, Ted !
Kiss her good !

315
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,667
Kiss the crap outta that girl !

316
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,787
Marshall, remember this night.

317
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,951
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech,

318
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,057
you're gonna tell this story.

319
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,387
Why does he get to be the best man ?

320
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,434
I'm your best friend !

321
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,825
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.

322
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,294
Unfortunately, one particular  thought did not.

323
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,065
I've got five dogs.

324
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,489
Not good. Not good.

325
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,157
- No !
- Get back in there !

326
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,773
You're wearing a suit !

327
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,305
Ted ?

328
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,158
Hi.

329
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,053
I was just, uh...

330
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,327
Come on up.

331
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,428
He's in.

332
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,712
So...

333
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,872
Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl ?

334
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,102
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

335
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:21,628
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.

336
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,204
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

337
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,708
The women hot there ?

338
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,033
Here's a picture of my wife.

339
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:32,950
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

340
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,529
She's lovely.

341
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,427
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit ?

342
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,505
I was just hoping to...

343
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,641
get those olives...

344
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,480
that you said I could have.

345
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:51,525
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth ?

346
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,033
Are you trying to get me drunk ?

347
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,275
For starters.

348
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:10,002
So, Marshall, this olive theory, based on you and Lilly ?

349
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,558
You hate olives.

350
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,492
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.

351
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,839
Yeah. Hate olives.

352
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,460
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street, dish of olives, you had some... what up ?

353
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:25,734
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.

354
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,734
- I swear.
- I swear.

355
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,120
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,012
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.

357
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:38,311
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives."
- But, you like olives.

358
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,783
Well, I was 18, okay ?
I was a virgin.

359
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,985
Been waitin' my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.

360
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,542
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.

361
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,686
Don't get married.

362
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,897
I think I like your olive theory.

363
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:02,553
I think I like your new French horn.

364
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,370
I think I like your nose.

365
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,518
I think I'm in love with you.

366
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:11,217
What ?! What ?! What ?!

367
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,643
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right ?

368
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,953
You know what that is.

369
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,685
Hunger.

370
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,524
You're hungry for experience.

371
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,025
Hungry for something new.

372
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,094
Hungry for olives.

373
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,184
But you're too scared to do anything about it.

374
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,029
Yeah, I'm scared, okay ?

375
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,924
But, when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lilly...

376
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,390
committing, forever, no other women...

377
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,808
doesn't scare me at all.

378
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,496
I'm marrying that girl.

379
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,075
Lilly.

380
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,689
Lilly, I like olives.

381
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,177
We'll make it work.

382
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,160
So, Orlando.
You gonna hit Disneyworld ?

383
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,428
You love me ?!

384
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,784
I-I-I can't believe I said that.

385
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,236
Why did I say that ?
Who says that ?

386
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,116
I should just go.

387
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,259
Hold on.

388
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,663
Wait a minute.

389
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,385
Promised you these.

390
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,366
Olives.
Thanks. I love you.

391
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,344
What is wrong with me ?

392
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:24,225
Why are we still sitting here ?

393
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:25,849
Let's go. We can still make last call.

394
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,706
What do you say, Lil ?

395
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,239
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum ?

396
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,844
'Cause you're a pirate.

397
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,136
Okay, eye patch, gone.

398
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,836
And we can't just abandon Ted.

399
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,563
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.

400
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,367
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

401
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,662
You think they're doin' it ?

402
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,037
You think they're doin' it in front of the dogs ?

403
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,337
Doggy style.

404
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,690
Hey, there was a girl in college, she had this golden retriever...

405
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,118
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

406
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,296
Hit it, Ranjit.

407
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,453
So, when you tell this story to your friends,

408
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,520
could you avoid the word "psycho ?"

409
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:04,456
I'd prefer. "eccentric."

410
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,951
Good night... psycho.

411
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:11,899
Great.

412
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,600
Um, how do I get to the F train ?

413
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:17,928
Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right.

414
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,373
You know what ?

415
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,378
I'm done being single.

416
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,203
I'm not good at it.

417
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,865
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.

418
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:33,651
But... it sucks that you can't.

419
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,857
I'll tell you something, though.

420
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:39,604
If a woman... not you, just some hypothetical woman...

421
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,382
were to bear with me through all this,

422
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,908
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

423
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,707
Because, that's the stuff I'd be good at,

424
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,153
stuff like making her laugh and being a good father.

425
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,569
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.

426
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,547
Being a good kisser.

427
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,542
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.

428
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,106
Oh, I've got references.

429
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,380
Good night, Ted.

430
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,834
And I'm a good handshaker.

431
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,285
That's a pretty great handshake.

432
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:17,813
And that was it.

433
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,613
I'll probably never see her again.

434
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,260
What ?

435
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,444
That was the signal.

436
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:28,175
That long, lingering handshake ?
You should have kissed her.

437
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,368
There's no such thing as "the signal."

438
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,580
But, yeah, that was the signal.

439
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:34,532
Signal.

440
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,983
Ah, Carl, thank you.

441
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,863
Something I gotta do.

442
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:42,246
By the way, you should have kissed her.

443
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,633
Carl ! You guys weren't there.

444
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,006
I am so turned on right now.

445
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:50,594
Guys, trust me.

446
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:51,999
I've seen the signal.

447
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,603
That was not the signal.

448
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,531
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

449
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,905
- To my fianc�e.
- To the future.

450
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,732
To one hell of a night !

451
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,397
That was not the signal.

452
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,709
I asked her about it years later.

453
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,783
And, yeah, that was the signal.

454
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,272
I could have kissed her.

455
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,146
But that's the funny thing about destiny.

456
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,175
It happens whether you plan it or not.

457
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,061
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again,

458
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,782
but it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle

459
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,525
to see the picture that was forming.

460
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:27,880
Because, that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.

461
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,481
Aunt Robin ?

462
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,472
I thought this was how you met mom !

463
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,509
Will you relax ?
I'm getting to it.

464
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:38,540
Like I said, it's a long story.

1
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:14,954
Okay, where was I?

2
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,433
You were telling us how you met Mom.

3
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:18,296
In excruciating detail.

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:24,042
Right. So, back in 2005, when I was 27, my two best friends got engaged,

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,751
and it got me thinking, maybe I should get married.

6
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,737
And then I saw Robin.

7
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,632
She was incredible.

8
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,459
I just knew I had to meet her.

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,504
That's where your Uncle Barney came in.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,968
I suggest we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"

11
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:39,770
Wait, no, no, no. We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,382
Hi. Have you met Ted?

13
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,297
So I asked her out.

14
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,011
And I know this sound crazy, but after just one date,

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,194
I was in love with her which made me say something stupid.

16
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,813
I think I'm in love with you.

17
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:52,729
What?!

18
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:53,983
Oh, Dad.

19
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,390
So then what happened?

20
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,000
Nothing.

21
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,616
I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.

22
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:03,839
So, a week went by, and I decided not to call her.

23
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:05,396
So you're not gonna call her?

24
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,387
You went from, "I think I'm in love with you" to "I'm not gonna call her"?

25
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,723
I wasn't in love with her, okay?

26
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:13,180
I was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married.

27
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:15,292
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

28
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,209
- Robin.
- Hi.

29
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,636
Look who I ran into.

30
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,225
Since when do you guys know each other?

31
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,543
Oh, since about... here.

32
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,406
Lily recognized me from the news and...

33
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:26,961
Hello, sailor!

34
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,478
They just got engaged.

35
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,903
Well, I should get back to the station.

36
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:33,470
See you, guys.

37
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,453
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.

38
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:40,940
- Dawn it!
- What?

39
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,459
- I'm in love with her.
- No!

40
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,340
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.

41
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:47,791
You blew it, it's over, move on.

42
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:52,445
I don't know, I just have this feeling she's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

43
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,460
Lily, you squeaked?

44
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,165
She said something about me, didn't she?

45
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,875
Come on, spill it, Red!

46
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,006
Fine.

47
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:02,208
So, what do we think of Ted?

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,751
Ted's something else.

49
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:06,794
Huh.

50
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,377
I'm gonna spin that as good.

51
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,022
Lots of guys are something, I'm something else.

52
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,750
Comes on a little strong.

53
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:15,249
But, that's part of my charm.

54
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:17,092
But, that's part of his charm.

55
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:19,490
Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,

56
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,764
he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am.

57
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,607
I mean, the most I can handle right now is something casual.

58
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,121
This just stays between us, right?

59
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,330
Are you kidding?

60
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,879
This flapper? Fort Knox.

61
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,497
Oops.

62
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,683
She wants casual.

63
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,060
Okay, I'll be casual.

64
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:41,121
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud of casual.

65
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:42,196
You know why?

66
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,450
Cause it's a game--

67
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,195
I want her to skip to the end and do the whole happily-ever-after thing.

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,878
But you don't get there unless you play the game.

69
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:50,245
So, are you going to ask her out?

70
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,718
Yeah... No!

71
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:55,610
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out, I'm asking her out.

72
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,476
So, how do I ask her out without asking her out?

73
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:04,781
Did you guys get high?

74
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,377
I got it.

75
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,852
I don't ask her out.

76
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,177
I invite her to our party next Friday.

77
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:12,701
We're having a party next Friday?

78
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:13,893
We are now.

79
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,050
Casual.

80
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:19,387
Yeah, cause nothing says "casual" like inviting a hundred people over just to mack on one girl.

81
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:21,927
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

82
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,999
You waited five minutes to tell me that?

83
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,353
All right, so call her up.

84
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,262
No, calling's not casual.

85
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,122
I just got to bump into her somewhere.

86
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,409
Now, if only I knew her schedule, I could arrange a chance encounter.

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,998
That's great, Ted-- you'll be the most casual stalker ever.

88
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,359
Ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger,

89
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:48,668
Lily had been, well, extra affectionate.

90
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,820
Baby, no.

91
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:54,020
I have a 25-page paper on constitutional law due Monday.

92
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,397
I barely started.

93
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:57,272
Hey, I'm just sitting here,

94
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,355
wearing my ring,

95
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,869
my beautiful ring.

96
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,139
Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong.

97
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,982
Like my shirt.

98
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,019
Kind of don't want to wear my shirt anymore.

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,520
Or... my underwear.

100
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,511
That's right, I'm not wearing any.

101
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,561
No underwear?

102
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,532
Not even slightly.

103
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:24,653
Guys.

104
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:27,644
Boundaries.

105
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,289
There she is.

106
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,187
Thanks, Bill.

107
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:35,769
I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th and Columbus...

108
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,571
75th and Columbus.

109
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,023
Game on!

110
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:46,188
...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg has climbed inside a grab-a-prize machine and gotten stuck.

111
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,664
And, all in the pursuit of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

112
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,161
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Trubotsky.

113
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,248
We're clear.

114
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:58,641
Thanks, Don.

115
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:00,457
Ted.

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,983
Robin, wow!

117
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,114
What are the odds?

118
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,260
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:08,830
Oh, you know, just, uh, shopping for, uh, dip.

120
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,162
I love dip.

121
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,325
I mean, I don't love dip, I like dip... as a friend, you know.

122
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,801
So, uh, hey, you, uh, reporting a news story or something?

123
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,552
Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine.

124
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,523
How sweet of you to call it news.

125
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:23,278
Wow. Kid in a crane machine.

126
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,290
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?

127
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,036
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

128
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:28,644
You're all sweaty!

129
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,179
Cute kid.

130
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,231
Um, you know, it's so funny I should run into you.

131
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:35,673
We're, uh, we're having a party next Friday, if you feel like swinging by.

132
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,705
But, you know, whatever.

133
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,944
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

134
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:41,664
It's too bad it's not tonight.

135
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,436
It is... it's tonight.

136
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,187
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?

137
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,931
Sorry, I guess I've been saying next Friday all week.

138
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,086
But, yeah, it's tonight, the, uh, the party's tonight.

139
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:52,534
But, you know, whatever.

140
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,012
Hello?

141
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,012
Hey, am I interrupting anything?

142
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,199
No, no, I'm just writing my paper.

143
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,503
Hitting the books.

144
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:07,698
Yeah, well, you and Lily might want to put some clothes on.

145
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:09,358
We're throwing a party in two hours.

146
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:10,545
Okay, bye.

147
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,284
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do when Robin shows up?

148
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,147
Okay, I got it all planned out.

149
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,638
She steps through the door-- and where's Ted?

150
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,932
Not eagerly waiting by the door.

151
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,354
No, I'm across the room at my drafting table,

152
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:32,166
showing some foxy young thing all my cool architect stuff.

153
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,913
So, Robin strolls over,

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,297
and I casually give her one of these: "Hey, what's up?"

155
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:42,294
She says, "Hey, nice place, et cetera, et cetera."

156
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:43,847
And then, I say,

157
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:45,649
"Well, make yourself at home."

158
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:48,445
And, I casually return to my conversation.

159
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,590
Then, an hour later...

160
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,791
"Oh, you're still here?" I say, 

161
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:57,799
like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise.

162
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,620
And then, very casually:

163
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,402
"Want to see the roof?"

164
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,855
The roof!

165
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,608
Get her up to the roof, and the roof takes care of the rest.

166
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,063
What's so special about the roof?

167
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,821
Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline.

168
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,626
You can't not fall in love on that roof.

169
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,688
We do it up there, sometimes.

170
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,941
Solid plan, my little friend.

171
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:21,934
We're the same height.

172
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:25,267
But, may I suggest one little modification.

173
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:29,394
That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her.

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,663
- Crazy monkey style...
- That's not the plan.

175
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,409
Well, it should be the plan. I mean, look at her.

176
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:36,035
Ted, look at her. She's smoking!

177
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,719
- Thank you!
- Yeah...

178
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,369
But, she's not Robin!

179
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,622
Exactly!

180
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,174
Ted, let's rap.

181
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:47,161
Statistic: At every New York party, there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at.

182
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:50,238
She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again.

183
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:54,728
Do you see where I'm going with this?

184
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:56,469
Barney, I don't think so.

185
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,529
Scoping.

186
00:07:58,173 --> 00:07:59,483
Scoping.

187
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,386
Man, you're a dork.

188
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:03,873
Target acquired!

189
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,477
Now it's time we play a little game I like to call "Have you met Ted?"

190
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:08,839
Oh, come on, not this.

191
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,109
Hi. Have you met Ted?

192
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:10,812
No.

193
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,019
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,950
- Do you know Marshall? Lily?
- No.

195
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,905
Hmm. Do you know anyone at this party?

196
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,588
I work with Carlos.

197
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:18,808
Excuse me.

198
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,442
Anyone know a Carlos?

199
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:21,568
- No.
- No.

200
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,408
On a silver platter.

201
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,514
Bon app�tit.

202
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:26,953
I don't think so.

203
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,058
Your loss, her gain.

204
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:30,081
Excuse me.

205
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,648
Can I show you the roof? It's magical up there.

206
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:33,611
- Sure.
- Wait, wait.

207
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,007
Hey, hey, I got that roof reserved.

208
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,488
Dude, Robin's not coming.

209
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,586
Hey, she's going to show up!

210
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,933
She'll show up.

211
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,756
She didn't show up.

212
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,227
At least it was a great party.

213
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,787
I ate, like, four whole cans of dip.

214
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,691
You always know what to say, old friend.

215
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,154
It's Robin.

216
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,376
Answer it.

217
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,733
No, no, not right away-- got to seem casual.

218
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,365
Hello?

219
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,586
I'm so sorry I missed your party.

220
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,107
Who is this? Meredith?

221
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,659
Robin.

222
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,244
Oh, Robin!

223
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,839
Hey! Yeah, I, uh, guess you never showed up, did you?

224
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,042
No, I got stuck at work.

225
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,618
But, they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.

226
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,436
Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?

227
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,853
Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

228
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:27,550
He was in there a long time, and little kids have small bladders.

229
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,351
I wish your party was tonight.

230
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:33,970
It is-- the party's tonight.

231
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:38,624
Yeah, uh... it's a two-day party, 'cause that's just how we roll.

232
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,581
Uh, so, if you want to swing by, you know, it's casual.

233
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:44,599
See ya.

234
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,591
So, that was Robin.

235
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,828
What are you doing to me, man?! I got a paper to write!

236
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,554
I know! Sorry! It's terrible!

237
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,611
- I'll buy more dip!
- Ted! Ted, wait!

238
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,401
Get French onion!

239
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,892
Can you believe this guy? I got a paper to write.

240
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:08,808
Okay, fine.

241
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:12,607
But, it's got to be, like, super-quick, and no cuddling after.

242
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:15,176
I'm the luckiest girl alive.

243
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,479
You were so right about the roof!

244
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:22,770
The roof!

245
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,250
The roof is on fire, Ted!

246
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,625
That girl from last night-- I took her back to my place,

247
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,017
then this morning, took her outside, spun her around a couple times

248
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,600
and sent her walking. She will never find her way back, and there she is.

249
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,751
How did she get here? Did you invite her?

250
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:38,887
I have no idea who that is.

251
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,535
She said she works with Carlos. Who's Carlos?

252
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,016
I don't know any Carlos.

253
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,503
Hi, you!

254
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,477
You're back!

255
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:46,751
I sure am.

256
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,985
Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.

257
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:52,582
"Sweetie"? Really?

258
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,735
Whoa! Whoa, rabbits!

259
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,868
Come on, I got that roof reserved.

260
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:00,869
All right.

261
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,615
So, it's over between me and works-with-Carlos girl.

262
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:06,960
Whoa! That was fast.

263
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:12,265
Yeah. I was trying to think, what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?

264
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,185
I think I'm in love with you.

265
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,065
What?!

266
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,218
Thanks, bro.

267
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,759
Glad I could help.

268
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,477
What the...

269
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:22,367
No, no, no. Come on.

270
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:23,851
Sorry, Ted.

271
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,024
Great. What am I going to do when Robin shows up?

272
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:29,842
She'll show up.

273
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,573
She didn't show up.

274
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:34,972
All right. We threw two parties.

275
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,722
Everybody had fun.

276
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:39,652
Everybody wanged, everybody chunged.

277
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:43,793
Now, the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed.

278
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,079
Repeat after me.

279
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,383
I will not have sex with Marshall.

280
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,241
I will not have sex with Marshall.

281
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,234
It's Robin.

282
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,213
Hello?

283
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,667
- Hi, Ted.
- Amanda?

284
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:02,232
Oh, Denise! Sorry, you totally sounded like Amanda.

285
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:03,090
It's Robin.

286
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,213
Oh, Robin.

287
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,426
Hi.

288
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:10,116
I totally wanted to come. I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there.

289
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,128
I'm sorry I missed your party, again.

290
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:15,416
Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing, mamacita.

291
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:16,987
Who am I?

292
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,232
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer?

293
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,456
It did, indeed. The party continues tonight.

294
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:29,522
Yeah. Uh, last night, people were like, "Keep it going, bro. Party trifecta."

295
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,096
Wow! Okay, well, I'll be there.

296
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,118
Great! See you tonight.

297
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,609
So, that was Robin.

298
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:43,176
So, I threw a third party for Robin...

299
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,137
on a Sunday night.

300
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,589
Well, this is lame.

301
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:48,655
Lame...

302
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,460
or casual?

303
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:51,915
Lame.

304
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,442
Or casual?

305
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,329
Hey, law books.

306
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,638
Ready for a little 15 minute recess?

307
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:02,386
Sorry, baby, I got to work. I need all my blood up here.

308
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:09,206
Has anybody seen An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923?

309
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:12,293
Anybody seen a big-ass book?

310
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:13,856
No.

311
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:15,570
Hello, Barney.

312
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,704
Of course.

313
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:21,561
You look well.

314
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,083
Is it weird they invited both of us?

315
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:26,082
Who?

316
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:30,670
Who invited you? No one even knows who you are!

317
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,388
I understand you're hurt, but

318
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,400
you don't have to be cruel.

319
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,991
Carlos was right about you.

320
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,560
Who is Carlos?!

321
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,459
Hey, where the hell is my...?

322
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,954
Oh...!

323
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:48,861
Okay...

324
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:55,968
An Introduction to Contract Tort and Restitution Statutes from 1865-1923

325
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,920
is not a coaster!

326
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:01,631
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career so you can throw not one,

327
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:03,955
not two, but three parties

328
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:07,293
for some girl that you just met who's probably not even going to show up!

329
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,773
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?

330
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,186
Where's Robin?

331
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:13,013
Hi.

332
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:14,712
Hi, Ron.

333
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,866
So, you threw all these parties for me?

334
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,663
No. Oh, you thought that... no!

335
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,726
I... okay, yes. You got me.

336
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:36,523
One of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you

337
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,976
to, um, this guy.

338
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:42,222
Uh, I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us

339
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,112
and now we can just laugh about it...

340
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,749
Anyway, Robin, this is...

341
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,924
Carlos.

342
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,053
- Oh!
- Oh!

343
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,368
She's still talking to Carlos.

344
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,073
I can still win this. I-it's not over.

345
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,864
Okay, buddy. Time for the tough talk.

346
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,807
Robin seems great, but let's look at the facts.

347
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,322
You want to get married.

348
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,869
And right now, there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you.

349
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,430
But Robin ain't one of them.

350
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,159
She's not just one of them. She's the one.

351
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:18,396
Yeah, well, the one is heading up to the roof.

352
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,424
What are you going to do?

353
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,196
Nothing.

354
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,138
It's a game. I got to just keep playing it.

355
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:07,906
Ted...

356
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,168
Hey, Carlos, can you give us a minute?

357
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,282
Hey, no sweat, hombre.

358
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:13,865
See ya.

359
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,612
Robin...

360
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:21,704
look, I didn't throw this party to set you up with Carlos,

361
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,036
or the one before that,

362
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:24,827
or the one before that.

363
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,841
I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.

364
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,340
Well, here I am.

365
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:35,728
There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.

366
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,919
You're not crazy.

367
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,088
I don't know, Ted.

368
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:43,306
I mean, we barely know each other

369
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,598
and you're looking at me with that look. And, it's like...

370
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,489
Like, like what?

371
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,509
Like, "Let's fall in love and get married

372
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,941
and have kids and drive them to soccer practice."

373
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,558
I'm not going to force sports on them unless they're interested.

374
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,569
It's a great look.

375
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,749
But you're looking at the wrong girl.

376
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,473
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

377
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:05,168
I don't want to get married right now, maybe ever.

378
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:11,644
And, if we got together, I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart, and...

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,326
I just couldn't do either of those things.

380
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,399
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.

381
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:22,908
Click.

382
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,634
Off. Let's make out.

383
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,767
What?

384
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,762
What? That was the off switch.

385
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,353
And I turned it off.

386
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,583
I mean, look, sure, yes, I want to fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.

387
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,858
But, on the other hand... you, me,

388
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,926
the roof.

389
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:43,820
There's no off switch.

390
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,322
There is an off switch.

391
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,474
And it's off.

392
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,245
No, it's not.

393
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,805
Yes, it is.

394
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,721
No, it's not.

395
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,839
Yes... it is.

396
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,362
No, it's not.

397
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,639
You're right. There's no off switch.

398
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,111
God, I wish there was an off switch!

399
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,170
Me, too.

400
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,412
So, um...

401
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,244
What do we do now?

402
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,356
We could be friends.

403
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:37,831
Oh...

404
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:43,924
Look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that, but...

405
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,638
we could.

406
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,964
I don't know, Robin.

407
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,853
I've made such a jackass of myself here.

408
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:54,200
We start hanging out, every time I see you it'll be like, "Oh, that's right. I'm a jackass."

409
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,950
You're not a jackass.

410
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,879
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April

411
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,455
and I'm always working and

412
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:04,864
I just haven't met a lot of good people so far.

413
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:07,655
But I understand.

414
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,829
Well, uh, maybe in a few months, after it's not so fresh,

415
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:17,844
we could all, uh, you know, get a beer.

416
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,462
Yeah.

417
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,832
That sounds good.

418
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,731
I'll see you, Ted.

419
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,924
Or, you know, now.

420
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,170
We could all get a beer now.

421
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,493
I'd like that.

422
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:49,317
My friends are going to love you... like you, you know, as a friend.

423
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:51,948
Jackass.

424
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,116
Unbelievable.

425
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,773
That's just a recipe for disaster. They work together!

426
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:00,739
Are you jealous?

427
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,116
Oh, please. What does Carlos have that I don't?

428
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,423
- A date tonight.
- Oh!

429
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,420
Stop the tape. Rewind. Play it again.

430
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:11,435
- A date tonight.
- Oh!

431
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,895
I'm not sure I like her.

432
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,361
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

433
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,952
- Dude, you're talking to the kid.
- I know it.

434
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,607
I'm going to knock back this beer.

435
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,552
I'm going to knock back one more beer.

436
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:24,547
I'm going to go home. I'm going to write a 25-page paper.

437
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:26,836
I'm going to hand it in and I'm going to get an "A."

438
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:30,308
My name is Rufus and that's the trufus.

439
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:32,125
He got a B-minus.

440
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:35,177
But still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?

441
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,576
The kid was good.

442
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,855
At least let me buy you a beer.

443
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:40,532
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.

444
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,669
I'll help carry.

445
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,290
- You know something Ted?
- What?

446
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:49,574
You are a catch.

447
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:52,195
You're going to make some girl very happy.

448
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,186
And I am going to help you find her.

449
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,188
Well, good luck.

450
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,412
I mean, maybe New York's just too big a town.

451
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,515
I mean, there's millions of people in this city.

452
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:04,730
How, in all this mess, is a guy supposed to find the love of his life?

453
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,361
I mean, where do you even begin?

454
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,348
Hi. Have you met Ted?

1
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,476
So there was this one night before I met your mother,

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,538
when I really wanted to go to the bar.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,190
The bar... big surprise.

4
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,054
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.

5
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,326
Well, that's just we did back then.

6
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,769
Me, Marshall and Lily,

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,613
Barney, Robin--

8
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,843
we all used to hang out at this one bar called McClaren's.

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:34,922
But then, one night...

10
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:36,120
Why don't we go to McClaren's?

11
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,364
Let's go to McClaren's.

12
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,941
You guys talking to each other?

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,465
Nobody's listening?

14
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,864
What's wrong with McClaren's?

15
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:44,937
McClaren's is bore-snore.

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,785
Ted, tonight we're going to go out.

17
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,343
We're going to meet some ladies.

18
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:50,509
It's going to be legendary.

19
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:51,465
Phone five.

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,670
I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.

21
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:57,829
You didn't phone five, did you?

22
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:00,328
I know when you don't phone five, Ted.

23
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:01,817
Come on.

24
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,875
We always to go to McClaren's.

25
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,894
Yeah, 'cause McClaren's is fun.

26
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,229
McClaren's is this much fun.

27
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,425
What I'm offering is the chance to have...

28
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,458
this much fun.

29
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,399
See, you say that.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,222
You say it's going to be this much fun,

31
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,889
but most of the time it ends up being this much fun.

32
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,466
This much fun is good.

33
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:21,253
It's safe. It's guaranteed.

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,727
This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?

35
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:24,740
No, it doesn't.

36
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:26,829
Get in the cab.

37
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,093
Marshall, you, too.

38
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,310
Oh, I wish I could. I think Lily and I are just going to...

39
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,943
I understand. Ted, get in the cab.

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,121
Why can Marshall say no?

41
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,265
Uh, because he's getting laid.

42
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,998
Consistently.

43
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:39,522
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.

44
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:42,891
You keep going to the same bar. You're in a rut.

45
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:44,437
And I am a rut-buster.

46
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,377
I'm going to bust your rut.

47
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:47,826
It's not a rut, okay?

48
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,885
It's a routine, and I like it.

49
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:53,545
Ted, what's the first syllable in "rut-tine"?

50
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,043
Peace out, suckers.

51
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,795
All right, so what's this legendary plan?

52
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,535
First we've got to pick someone up at the airport.

53
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,747
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Estaban, doors.

54
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,765
Okay, we just do this one little thing, and the rest of the night is ours.

55
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:22,370
Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?

56
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,145
I don't know.

57
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,154
Maybe her.

58
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:25,300
Or her.

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,911
Wait, so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport,

60
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:34,044
you meant you were going to "pick someone up" at the airport?

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,913
Scenario: a couple of girls fly into town looking for a fun weekend in NYC,

62
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:42,001
when the meet two handsome international businessmen

63
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:44,731
just back from a lucrative trip to Japan.

64
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,646
Sample dialogue:

65
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:49,993
"You have a wheelie bag? Well, I have a wheelie bag."

66
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,135
You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:51,986
False.

68
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,694
Sidebar... tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.

69
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,245
I'm sketchy?

70
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,380
Trust me, it's going to be legendary.

71
00:02:58,606 --> 00:02:59,945
Don't say "legendary," okay?

72
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,584
You're too liberal with the word "legendary."

73
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,560
We're building an igloo in Central Park.

74
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:07,591
It's going to be legendary. Snowsuit up!

75
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,765
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,800
This is happening. Now you can either put the bags on the carousel now,

77
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,227
or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you

78
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,434
to put the bags on the carousel. Your move.

79
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,322
Ted, since the dawn of time-- mankind has struggled...

80
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:30,023
That night, Marshall had  a ton of studying to do.

81
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,471
So Lily went out  with Robin--

82
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,832
who was new to New York and looking for a friend.

83
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,124
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out, just the two of us.

84
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:37,809
Yeah.

85
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:42,249
You sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old, almost married lady?

86
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,722
Oh, please. I'm so sick of the meat market scene.

87
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,248
Guys are like the subway.

88
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,751
You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes.

89
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,931
Unless it's the end of the night and then you get on anything.

90
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:52,914
Hey-oh!

91
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:56,217
Compliments of that guy.

92
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,001
Really?

93
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,277
Sweet.

94
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,299
Oh, for you it's $6.

95
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,426
Oh, yes, that's one drawback to being engaged.

96
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,957
I'm sure that's why he didn't...

97
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,766
Hey.

98
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:10,864
Oh, hello.

99
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,478
So, uh... did you just get in from Detroit?

100
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,037
Japan.

101
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,397
Okay, carousel 4 is tapped out.

102
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,442
Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge.

103
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,957
Cute girls are not from Buffalo.

104
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,500
Time-out, 10:00.

105
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:39,132
You ready to rock this, Tedder?

106
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,884
All right, I think we need to refine our back story first. How did we...?

107
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,416
Ted, you klutzy great guy you.

108
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,025
- Hey, I'm Barney.
- Hi.

109
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,344
- My God, are you okay?
- I am so sorry.

110
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,348
It's fine. No, you were shaky on your landing. I give you a 9.2.

111
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,293
Ooh. Hi. I'm Ted.

112
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,285
I'm Laura.

113
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,302
Look, I'm really sorry that we have to hit and run, but we've got a plane to catch.

114
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,182
- Where you headed?
- Philadelphia.

115
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,305
Philly? That's where we're headed.

116
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:06,330
You are?

117
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,054
Well, then we'll see you on the plane.

118
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,268
Yes, you will.

119
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,983
Follow them. Ticket's on me.

120
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,295
No. Barney!

121
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,138
Don't you get on that escalator!

122
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,019
And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!

123
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,228
Studying law.

124
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:35,275
Making a responsible choice for my future.

125
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,724
On Friday night.

126
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:44,991
Being a lawyer had better be awesome.

127
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,443
Whazzup, Ted?

128
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,245
Are you all right?

129
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:53,195
Yeah.

130
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,426
Hey, guess where I am. I'm on a... ready?

131
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:57,668
Plane to... ready? Philadelphia.

132
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,353
That is awesome.

133
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,327
Hey, is that Marshall?

134
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:03,286
Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Fiero of yours

135
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,045
and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary.

136
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,791
Man, I wish I could, guys...

137
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:10,861
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sent you some pictures on my phone. Check it.

138
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:17,268
Philly.

139
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:20,196
Admit it: you're having fun.

140
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,515
This much fu... 35,000 feet of fun.

141
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,913
Well, I didn't think I'd be flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.

142
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,146
Attaboy. Let's go talk to those girls.

143
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,911
Whoa, whoa, the seat belt sign's on.

144
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:36,295
Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seat belt.

145
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,081
It's time to unclick.

146
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:44,132
- Sir, the seat belt light's on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

147
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,218
Well, I grew up in Park Slope.

148
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,917
Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?

149
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,263
You're from Park Slope?

150
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:53,549
Uh, no, she is.

151
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:55,602
So where are you from?

152
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,642
Heaven?

153
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,699
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

154
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,598
I died 15 years ago, like that pickup line.

155
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,810
Hey-oh!

156
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,943
God, I'm so sorry.

157
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,446
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

158
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,750
I have this line that I use when guys come...

159
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:09,784
Check it out.

160
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,628
Hey...

161
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:15,703
You take this one. I'll save it for the next one.

162
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:20,323
So what brings you guys to Philly?

163
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,638
We're visiting our boyfriends.

164
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,003
I think hers is going to propose this weekend.

165
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:25,934
Isn't that great?

166
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,908
So great.

167
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,668
So there we were:

168
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:38,560
stuck on an airplane to Philadelphia with two very un-single girls,

169
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,613
all thanks to your Uncle Barney.

170
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,821
Aren't they cute?

171
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,182
They're both linebackers for the Eagles.

172
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,513
Both?

173
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:49,261
Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.

174
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:53,325
You're going to Philly? Why?

175
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,004
I didn't ask.

176
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,957
Well, it's sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am.

177
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:03,340
I'm just talking to guy's backs while they hit on Robin.

178
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,543
Yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.

179
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,975
Don't you bet I get that a lot?

180
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,392
Not with a ring on your finger.

181
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:13,580
I mean, you know, guys see the ring, it's like ka-chong, Marshall parking only.

182
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:16,336
Oh, of course. That's it, the ring.

183
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,056
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

184
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,683
Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger,

185
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:23,059
you'd have a ton of guys crowding your junk.

186
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,183
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

187
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,253
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?

188
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,730
Oh, yeah, you know me-- I'm the jealous type.

189
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,843
Any goon so much as looks at you, I'll sock him in the kisser.

190
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,004
No. Seriously, you girls have a good time tonight.

191
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,222
Bye.

192
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:47,490
Robin!

193
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:48,545
Robin!

194
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,660
Hey, I'm over here.

195
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:55,196
G-G-Goin' to Philly!

196
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,014
Marshall, don't come to Philly.

197
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,909
But we're on an adventure.

198
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:03,266
We're on a tarmac in Philadelphia. Crazy... adventure.

199
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:04,673
Fine.

200
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:08,023
No! No!

201
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:09,600
The night has just started.

202
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,363
Look, airport bar. Flight attendants.

203
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,026
They'll get your tray table in its full upright position.

204
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,505
Say what?!

205
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,167
Passengers Mosby and Stenson, please come with us, gentlemen.

206
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,621
Keep your hands where I can see them.

207
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,977
Barney, I am going to kill you.

208
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:27,141
Don't say you're gonna kill someone in front of airport security.

209
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:28,650
Not cool, not cool.

210
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,116
This is an outrage!

211
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:37,934
We are international businessmen on very important international business trip.

212
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,340
I demand you release us immediately!

213
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,250
You demand?! No, no, no, no, no.

214
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,723
He does not demand. We-We-We-We have no demands.

215
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,879
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to remain calm.

216
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:48,859
Okay. Yeah, I'm calm. I'm totally calm.

217
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:53,423
We've got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel 3,

218
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,876
and abandoning them to purchase a last-minute flight with cash.

219
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,356
Those bags were your responsibility.

220
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,875
- They were your bags!
- Sir, please.

221
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,579
We're assessing the bag situation.

222
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,148
Look, this is all just... It's a misunderstanding.

223
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:12,212
Please.

224
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,944
We are international businessmen.

225
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,741
My colleague accidentally left the bags there.

226
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:23,251
Now, please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.

227
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:29,815
Can't remember the last time I saw an international businessman with an untucked shirt.

228
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,945
In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.

229
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,822
Believe it or not, that duffel bag thing worked.

230
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,288
The truth is, my friend--

231
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,505
he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage

232
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:12,439
to pick up girls, and we followed some here to Philadelphia.

233
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,974
That-That-That's it. That's all this is.

234
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,574
Nobody's that lame.

235
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,772
Yes, he's that lame.

236
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,421
Tell him you're that lame.

237
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,586
- We are international businessmen.
- Oh, come on!

238
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,837
Sir, lower your voice, or I will restrain you.

239
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,927
Dude, seriously, relax.

240
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,272
We at least get to call our lawyer.

241
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:35,516
Exactly!

242
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:37,609
We have a lawyer?

243
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,118
Listen to me-- you're both American citizens.

244
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,421
Dot let him pull any Patriot Act voodoo.

245
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:46,733
You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present,

246
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,003
so don't say anything until I get there, all right?

247
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,231
Okay. Good-bye.

248
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,463
Philly!

249
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:55,715
The adventure continues!

250
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,608
Destroy!

251
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:03,666
It's ridiculous in here. Why don't we go somewhere else?

252
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:07,082
No, this place is great.

253
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,881
What are you doing?

254
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:11,965
What?

255
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:14,142
With your lips and everything?

256
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:17,102
My lips are always like this.

257
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:29,113
You had to play the race card.

258
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,431
Oh, relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong.

259
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,978
And, B.T.W., we'd be out of here by now if you had tucked in your shirt.

260
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,086
Go ahead, JFK. What is the baggage status?

261
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:41,095
They're clean.

262
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,834
It's just a whole bunch of condoms.

263
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:44,815
And a PowerBar.

264
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,113
You're free to go.

265
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,299
Don't come to Philly.

266
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,942
Man, I'm almost halfway there.

267
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,230
Yeah, we just got released and we're heading back on the next flight.

268
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,500
Uh, meet us at McClaren's. Maybe we can still make last call.

269
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,864
Can't we just, just...

270
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,429
No, we can't just.

271
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,508
We're going home.

272
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,312
We're going to Sasha's.

273
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:04,729
Who the hell is Sasha?

274
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,326
Sasha.

275
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,311
She's having friends over for drinks at her house.

276
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:12,214
It's gonna be legen... wait for it--

277
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:15,926
and I hope you're not lactose-intolerant 'cause the second half of that word is... dary!

278
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,882
- No.
- Legendary.

279
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,705
Legendary. That sounds awesome.

280
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:21,579
No, Marshall, we're going back.

281
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:22,726
Fine.

282
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,578
Hold on. I have another call.

283
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,662
- Hello?
- Marshall, we're going to Sasha's.

284
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:28,800
No, we're not.

285
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:31,362
- Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Right here.

286
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,516
Yes, we are.

287
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:35,004
Sorry, buddy-- two against one.

288
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:38,726
Ooh, look, a booth opened up.

289
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:39,622
Really?

290
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,348
Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk...

291
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,625
and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away.

292
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:44,896
Yeah, yeah, booth.

293
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,880
I'm engaged. You know, I'm sorry.

295
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:59,688
I took my ring off. It's very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I just...

296
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,106
Yeah, I'm gay.

297
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,639
I just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape.

298
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:08,709
Oh, damn it.

299
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:16,916
So Barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia, PA.

300
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,734
Our first and only stop:

301
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,214
Sasha's party.

302
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,622
So, uh... you're Sasha's friends, uh?

303
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:28,636
You know it.

304
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:33,269
You guys, keep the volume down.

305
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:35,195
You're gonna wake my grandpa.

306
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,571
Who wants hard lemonade?

307
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:47,693
Philly!

308
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:48,800
Shh!

309
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,545
Philly.

310
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:59,367
Back at the bar, girls' night out wasn't going as Robin had hoped.

311
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,019
Lily's phone.

312
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,061
Robin, uh, where's Lily?

313
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:09,827
She's, uh...

314
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:12,346
Is she talking to some hot guy?

315
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:15,408
Oh, you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea.

316
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,409
Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.

317
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,333
Really? Well, I thought it was kind of weird, but if you're cool with it,

318
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,966
yeah, uh, it's off, and she's talking to some guy.

319
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,664
- Do you want me to go over and...
- No, no, don't interrupt.

320
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,718
It's awesome.

321
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,462
So, the ring's really off, huh?

322
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,469
It's awesome.

323
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,251
Well, just tell her I called.

324
00:15:36,415 --> 00:15:40,531
And tell her that she is... awesome.

325
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:47,797
Really, really awesome.

326
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,963
Our relationship is built on mutual trust.

327
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,768
I can't breathe.

328
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,803
You hear that, Ted?

329
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,073
Dana works security at the Liberty Bell.

330
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,096
I do okay.

331
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:06,158
Wow, it must be really well cordoned off over there.

332
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,636
Do you ever go behind the rope and touch it?

333
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,060
Only all the time.

334
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,620
You ever, like, stick your head inside it?

335
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:13,833
Yeah.

336
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,132
You ever lick it?

337
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:17,867
Nope.

338
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,489
I have never licked it.

339
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:26,017
I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell.

340
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:30,288
If someone were to pull that off, I dare say it would be...

341
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,764
what's the word?

342
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:33,744
Well, this is my stop.

343
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,727
Legendary. Ted, legendary.

344
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:38,159
Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sasha, thank you,

345
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:41,743
and, uh, tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom.

346
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,038
I'll get some club soda for that stain.

347
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,527
Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out.

348
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,606
What are you doing?

349
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:56,611
Just fending off the advances of that totally hot guy.

350
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:00,153
- Dude, I think that guy is gay.
- Oh, I know that guy is gay.

351
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:03,222
It's just, Marshall and I have been together for nine years.

352
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,647
I haven't been single since high school.

353
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,179
You want to be single?

354
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,298
You want to fight off loser guys all night?

355
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,676
Does that seem like fun to you?

356
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:13,758
I guess I just wanted to throw this net back into the ocean

357
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:16,707
and see how many fish I could catch.

358
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:19,702
So far, one. One gay dolphin.

359
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:21,447
And Marshall.

360
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,703
Lily, all these girls here tonight are all hoping to catch what you've already got.

361
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:28,063
You're right. I know.

362
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:32,847
Hey, do you want to go get coffee and have an actual conversation?

363
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:36,536
If by "coffee" you mean "cheesecake," then yes.

364
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:38,800
Hey, I got that club soda.

365
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:39,957
Let's see that booty.

366
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,019
Oh, thank you so much.

367
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:47,663
You want to mess, pal?

368
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,258
That's my fianc�e's hot backside that you're dabbing.

369
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,835
Marshall, no.

370
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:55,987
Baby, please, don't ever take that ring off again, no matter how awesome I say that it is.

371
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,960
- It's okay, man...
- Back off, hombre!

372
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,817
I'm not that afraid to fight you.

373
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,850
You want to test this guy, be my guest, come on.

374
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,523
Marshall, he's gay.

375
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,048
Oh, thank God. I've never been in a fight before.

376
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,096
You don't say.

377
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:12,945
So, it turned out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type.

378
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,384
Unfortunately, that guy's boyfriend--

379
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,128
also the jealous type.

380
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:19,689
Hey!

381
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,323
Could have licked the Liberty Bell.

382
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,704
We're going to the airport.

383
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,351
Bong...

384
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:37,798
bong...

385
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,735
Why do I hang out with you? Why?

386
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,812
All I wanted was to have a regular beer at my regular bar

387
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,649
with my regular friends in my regular city.

388
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:49,349
Ted, Ted, Ted.

389
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,565
You're not even looking.

390
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,872
No, I'm not.

391
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:57,716
Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay?

392
00:18:57,772 --> 00:19:00,742
Not for the sit around and wait of happiness.

393
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:04,376
Now, if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer,

394
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:09,318
talk to the same people every day, or you can lick the Liberty Bell.

395
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:14,602
You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it.

396
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:17,715
That was beautiful, man.

397
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:19,967
Thanks, Leonard.

398
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,433
Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson here.

399
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,492
Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay?

400
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,137
I know how to live.

401
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:30,232
If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell, just go lick it yourself.

402
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,785
No, it has to be the two of us.

403
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,540
Why? Why do you need me?

404
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,871
Because you're my best friend, all right?

405
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,804
You don't have to tell me I'm yours,

406
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,292
but the way I see it, we're a team.

407
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:43,013
Without you, I'm...

408
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,141
I'm just the Dynamic Uno.

409
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:52,782
So, fine, if you wanto go home, then we'll go home.

410
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,446
Fine.

411
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:00,334
We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.

412
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:01,809
Good 'cause we're here.

413
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:07,574
I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out,

414
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:11,747
Dana let us in, and by God, we licked the Liberty Bell.

415
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,360
You know what it tastes like?

416
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:14,343
What?

417
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:16,975
Freedom.

418
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,975
No, actually, it tastes like pennies.

419
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:21,727
Oh, my God.

420
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:23,508
Did you guys really do that?

421
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,038
We really did.

422
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,290
And that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney.

423
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:30,517
I never got where I thought I wanted to go,

424
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,509
but I always got a great story.

425
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:39,394
So, that girl you were talking to-- that was Mom?

426
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:43,318
Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an Impressionist painting...

427
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,624
So that's a no?

428
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,416
Yeah, that's a no.

429
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,301
What? Come on!

1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,942
Kids, when you're single all you're looking for is happily ever after.

2
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:20,531
but only one of your stories can end that way.

3
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,865
The rest end with someone getting hurt.

4
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:27,556
This is one of those stories, and it starts with a shirt.

5
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:28,542
A shirt?

6
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:33,476
Just listen, because none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for that shirt.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,553
Nice shirt.

8
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:41,549
- Right? Right?
- Look at those colors.

9
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,391
Green and brown, together at last.

10
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,469
Hot top, bro!
Is it new?

11
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,412
That's the crazy part.
I've had this shirt for like six years.

12
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,119
Until this morning, I wasn't into it at all,

13
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,457
but now, it's like my tastes have changed.

14
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:54,823
- Booger.
- Yes, hello, Barney.

15
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:59,056
Barney's offered me 50 bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.

16
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,632
Not some stupid word-- "booger."

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,409
But I'm not doing it.
I am a journalist.

18
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,917
What?! Journalist?!

19
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,588
You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news.

20
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:12,579
Old people. Babies. Monkeys.
That's not journalism.

21
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,651
That's just... things in a diaper.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,770
For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to...

23
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,733
the city hall beat.

24
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,071
City hall? Miss Thing.

25
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,883
So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying "booger" for 50 bucks.

26
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:28,139
Of course not.

27
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:32,516
'cause now you're saying "nipple," and it's a hundred.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,051
Step into my web.

29
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,091
Whose bourbon is this?

30
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,665
Ooh, I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,189
The point is...
I seem to like bourbon now.

32
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,920
I could've sworn I hated bourbon.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,987
First the shirt, now bourbon.

34
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,916
I spent 27 years making up my mind about things, right?

35
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,695
The movie I saw once and hated;

36
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:56,590
the city I'll never go back to 'cause it was raining the day I visited.

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,507
Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions.

38
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,281
You're finally gonna watch Goonies again?

39
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,576
"Sloth love Chunk."

40
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,412
Not Goonies-- girls.

41
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:08,924
What if there's someone from my past

42
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,358
who I thought was wrong for me at the time,

43
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:15,479
when in fact she, like this shirt,
is actually a perfect fit?

44
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,244
Hold up.

45
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:19,253
There are only two reasons to ever date a girl you've already dated:

46
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,483
Breast... implants.

47
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:23,490
You know, this isn't a bad idea.

48
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,470
Let's think...
Ted's greatest hits.

49
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:29,221
What about that girl Steph?

50
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,804
Steph...

51
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,830
Okay, this is difficult to say:

52
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:40,196
Back when I lived in L.A., I was pretty broke so I spent a month making adult films.

53
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:44,477
Wow. Okay...
H-How many did you make?

54
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,083
A hundred and seventy-five.

55
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:52,103
Say what you will about the porn industry, they're hard workers.

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,259
What about that chick, um... Jackie?

57
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:58,884
...and my bathing suit had fallen completely off.

58
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,491
I know the feeling.
Once...

59
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:05,809
when I was 16, I was driving, and I hit this hitchhiker.

60
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,819
Don't know what happened to him--
just kept driving.

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,809
Uh... no.

62
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,638
What about Natalie?

63
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:18,238
Natalie...

64
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:21,063
- Who's Natalie?
- Natalie.

65
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:23,553
I had so many fond memories of her:

66
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:28,610
The tea candles on her dresser, the sock monkey collection on her bed,

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,970
that one Belle & Sebastian song she always listened to, her smile...

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,659
Man, I haven't seen her in, like, three years.

69
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,981
Well, why'd you guys break up?

70
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,718
I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time.

71
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,815
Of course, now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad.

72
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:45,198
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?

73
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:48,784
You dumped a porn star?

74
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:53,249
Friendship over.
Friendship over!

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,188
Come in!

76
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,708
All right, get back to me, then.

77
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,434
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams.
- Yes, I did.

78
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,655
I need you to cover a story.

79
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,766
It's down at city hall.

80
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,221
City hall?
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,011
So, next time you're passing city hall,

82
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:16,230
make sure and stop by New York's oldest hot dog cart.

83
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,310
Today, a delicious hot dog will cost you $2.50,

84
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,765
but back when the stand first opened, in 1955,

85
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,224
you could get one for only a nipple.

86
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:29,360
Reporting live, Robin Trubotsky, Metro News One.

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,152
I said "nipple" on the news.

88
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:34,727
That was so unprofessional!
I said "nipple" on the news!

89
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,050
At least it's better than "booger."

90
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,153
Booger.

91
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,527
There she is.

92
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,186
Hey, is it cold in here?

93
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,739
'Cause I can kinda see Robin's nickels.

94
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,738
Now, for your next challenge...

95
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:53,893
There is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.

96
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,678
Oh, search your soul, Robin.

97
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,485
You and I both know this wasn't about the money.

98
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,138
Sure, Metro News One pays you jack,

99
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:06,177
and, hey, a little green salad on the side is good for you, me, and Mr. McGee.

100
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:08,500
Seriously, who talks like that?

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,872
What baby really likes is the thrill of pulling one over

102
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:14,605
on those bean-counters who underappreciate you,

103
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,618
and still haven't promoted you,

104
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,447
and so for two more hundie sticks,

105
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:23,244
baby's going to look in the camera and say this.

106
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,755
I'm just assuming.

107
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:30,049
I gotta get back twork.

108
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,572
- See ya.
- Bye.

109
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,609
Baby's gonna think about it.

110
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,028
Found it!
I found Natalie's number.

111
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,988
Hey, Ted! Nice shirt!
Is it yesterday already?

112
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,964
I am calling her.

113
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,938
This is crazy.
I haven't talked to her in, like, three years.

114
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:52,342
Wonder if she even remembers me.

115
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,738
- Hello?
- Natalie.

116
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,033
- It's Ted Mosby.
- Go to hell.

117
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:05,776
She remembers me.

118
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,605
Why would Natalie hang up on you?

119
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,029
- I don't know.
- Did you sleep with her sister?

120
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,934
No.

121
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,038
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.

122
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:18,173
I'm losing interest in your story.

123
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,949
Well, you must have done something.
Why did you guys break up?

124
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,310
He wasn't ready for a commitment.

125
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,772
And her birthday might've been coming up.

126
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,849
Okay, so I didn't want to get a boyfriend-level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with.

127
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,259
So you dumped her right before her birthday?

128
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,348
No, I didn't dump her right before her birthday.

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,046
Natalie! Hey.
Happy birthday.

130
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,317
Listen... :

131
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:53,930
- Never break up with a girl on her birthday!
- Lily, please! The shirt!

132
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,126
I know!
It was a mistake!

133
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:59,654
- Well, did she cry her eyes out?
- I don't know.

134
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,593
How do you not...?!

135
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:07,181
- You didn't.
- Natalie! Hey, happy birthday.

136
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,192
Listen...

137
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:15,557
You're awesome.
You really are.

138
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:16,878
Awesome.

139
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,702
I'm just like super-busy right now, so...

140
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:23,295
maybe we should just... call it a day.

141
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,387
But you're awesome.

142
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:28,826
On her answering machine!?

143
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,089
- And on her birthday?!
- Lily, come on.

144
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,873
Oh, who breaks up with somebody on their answering machine on her birthday?!

145
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,756
Yeah, dude. E-mail.

146
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:41,338
Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall.

147
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:44,258
That is a terrible way to break up with someone.

148
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,770
Okay, in my client's defense,

149
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,725
is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No.

150
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:53,248
Personally, I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.

151
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,248
It's the least painful way you can do it.

152
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,486
- Who are you calling?
- Hi, Marshall, it Lily.

153
00:07:57,486 --> 00:08:01,086
We're not gonna have sex for at least a month, but you're awesome.

154
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,419
Okay, bye-bye.

155
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,191
No, that was a big mistake, Ted.
You should've done it in person.

156
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,287
Thank you.

157
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,954
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me sex is amazing.

158
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:14,155
Okay, it was childish and stupid.
I just...

159
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:15,472
I didn't want to see her cry.

160
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:18,187
Well, guess what?
She cried.

161
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,915
You just didn't have the sack to face those tears.

162
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,432
That was me then, okay?

163
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:25,803
This is the new, old-shirt- wearing, sack-having Ted.

164
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,155
I'm gonna make this right.

165
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:27,850
You know what else?

166
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,800
"My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn 30" sex.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,843
Fantastic.

168
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,605
An occasion that was supposed to be joyous,

169
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,770
suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Margolis,

170
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,608
New York's oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this,

171
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:46,482
the eve of their 100th birthday.

172
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:49,262
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.

173
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,131
Reporting live, Robin Trubotsky, Metro News One.

174
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,402
Clear.

175
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,353
Joel Adams wants to see you in his office.

176
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,683
Before you say anything,

177
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:07,235
I just want to say I really like working here at Metro News One.

178
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:13,033
- That's great.
- So, my dog keeps going...

179
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,557
- What's...?
- What? You have dogs, right?

180
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,144
What do you think that means?

181
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,398
Take him to the vet?

182
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,376
Genius.

183
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,249
That's one I owe you.

184
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,139
- Was that all?
- Yeah.

185
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,904
And nothing about the twins story?

186
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,499
Oh, yeah, great job on that one.

187
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:35,545
New York loves you. You're a superstar. Bye-bye.

188
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:42,308
That's when Robin realized that no one, not even her boss, watched Metro News One.

189
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,540
Natalie! Come on!
I just want to say I'm sorry.

190
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,858
I only came down here 'cause you wouldn't take my call.

191
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,406
Hey, here's an idea--

192
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,761
Why don't you leave a message?

193
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:08,658
Good one.

194
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:12,284
Okay, fine, I'm just going to leave this sock monkey here.

195
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,338
Good-bye.

196
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,116
Look, look, look.

197
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:24,316
I know you're mad, but... happy birthday.

198
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,449
- Three years ago.
- Oh, yeah?

199
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,415
Up yours three years ago.

200
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,429
Look, look, I was an idiot leaving that message.

201
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,432
I realize how much that sucked.

202
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,529
No, you don't.

203
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,663
Maybe we should just call it a day.

204
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:42,068
But you're awesome.

205
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,923
Okay, bye.

206
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,067
Surprise.

207
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,696
There was a surprise party that night?

208
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,233
How come nobody told me?

209
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,467
People think I can't keep a secret, but I totally can.

210
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,700
Sorry, not the issue.

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,852
Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment.

212
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:07,202
And I suppose you're suddenly ready to get married and settle down.

213
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,425
Well, yeah, actually.

214
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,522
I'm a different guy now.

215
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,164
Give me another chance, huh?

216
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:17,263
You must think I have absolutely no self-respect.

217
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:19,937
Come on, just a cup of coffee.

218
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,239
Please, Natalie.
Give the guy a chance.

219
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,388
Self-respect is overrated.

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,351
Maybe it was the caffeine, but you really brought your game up to a whole new level.

221
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,482
Thanks.

222
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:43,836
I did just start subscribing to Esquire.

223
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,593
They have some helpful columns.

224
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,924
The following is from the October issue.

225
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:53,340
So Natalie and I started dating again.

226
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,750
And just like that, it all came back.

227
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,914
The tea candles... the sock monkeys...

228
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:01,497
Belle and Sebastian, all of it.

229
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:04,778
It seemed like happily ever after wasn't far off.

230
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:08,061
Well, I better run.
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

231
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,404
Krav Maga. How cool is it that she does Krav Maga?

232
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,036
Thanks, honey.

233
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:16,741
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!
- Take it easy.

234
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,257
Dude, what's Krav Maga?

235
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,703
I have no idea.
Some kind of yoga?

236
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,531
You know, that Natalie, she's good times.

237
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:26,458
Yeah, she's, like, the best girl you've dated in years.

238
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,952
- Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.
- Yeah.

239
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,279
I have to break up with her.

240
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,494
I don't get it, man.
Natalie's awesome.

241
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:41,800
I know, she's terrific, but I have to break up with her.

242
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:46,427
Why couldn't you leave that poor girl alone?

243
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:47,958
I know. I hate this.

244
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,588
These past three weeks have been great.

245
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:53,093
I should be in love with her, but I'm not feeling that thing.

246
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:56,439
- It's ineffable.
- Ineffable.

247
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,701
Good word.

248
00:12:58,004 --> 00:12:59,476
So when are you going to do it?

249
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:00,962
She's probably on the subway by now.

250
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,346
You could call her voice mail:

251
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,992
Beep! "Dumped."
Click. Done.

252
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,712
No, I have to do this face-to-face.

253
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,223
I just, I don't know what I'm going to say.

254
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,246
"I'm not ready for a commitment."

255
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,853
- Oh, that's such a clich�.
- It's not a clich�, it's a classic.

256
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,472
It's the "Stairway to Heaven" of breakup lines.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,306
Well, I think Natalie deserves better.

258
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:23,055
Better. There's no "better" in breaking up.

259
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:26,817
There's only "less awful."
A clich� is a clich� for a reason.

260
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:28,765
- It's comforting.
- It doesn't matter.

261
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,500
I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so...

262
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,441
Oh, my God. There's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.

263
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,755
No, no, we're gonna get you out of this.

264
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:40,552
Okay, how about... "It's not you, it's me"?

265
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:42,696
Mm, mm, six words--

266
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,721
"You look fat in those jeans."
You're free to go.

267
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,958
Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?

268
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,484
Seriously, honey, men are working here.

269
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,301
Ted, what is the truth?
Why do you want to break up with her?

270
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:00,726
The truth?
She's not the one.

271
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:03,477
- So tell her that.
- Oh, you can't tell her that.

272
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,608
That's horrible.

273
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:07,182
Why? What is so horrible about that?

274
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:10,980
Yeah, what is so horrible about that?
She's not the one.

275
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,113
Why is that such a heartbreaking thing to hear?

276
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:17,483
The chances of one person being another person's "the one" are, like, six billion-to-one.

277
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,149
Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery.

278
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,360
Exactly!

279
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,324
You wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.

280
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,178
All right, man, tell her the truth.

281
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:26,867
She's gonna cry.

282
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,082
Yeah, and he's gonna sit there and he's gonna take it like a man.

283
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,856
I have to do the mature thing.

284
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,182
Want to talk mature?

285
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:37,718
I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.

286
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,954
And great TV was had by all.

287
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,013
All right, Trubotsky, new challenge, and this one's big.

288
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:47,127
But so is the cash reward.

289
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:50,535
For $1,000-- you heard me--

290
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:54,168
all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these.

291
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,231
- What the hell is that?
- The Ickey Shuffle.

292
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,596
And as you do it, you say this:

293
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,176
Elbert "Icky" Woods, the Bengals were fools to cut you in '91.

294
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:15,776
Your 1,525 rushing yards and your 27 touchdowns will not be forgotten.

295
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:20,722
So Coach Dave Shula, screw you and your crappy steakhouse.

296
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,097
Just write it down for me.

297
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,078
What do I care?

298
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,962
It's not like anyone's watching, anyway, right?

299
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:32,021
Man, she's gonna cry.

300
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,327
It's the law of love, chunk.

301
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,586
Thanks, Lil.

302
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:43,653
So, the next night, I took Natalie out to dinner... to do the mature thing.

303
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:46,893
Look, uh, Natalie, there's something I have to say.

304
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:48,676
Oh, wait, wait.
There's something I have to say first.

305
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:53,883
Today, at work, I had not one, not two, but three birthday cakes.

306
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,406
So tonight, can we just skip the cake?

307
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,299
Today's your birthday?

308
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,006
Yeah. No, it's okay, I wasn't telling anyone about it.

309
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,979
Today's your birthday!

310
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,321
I...

311
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,978
I didn't get you anything.

312
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:09,590
Oh, it's okay.

313
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,886
You know, you've already given me the bt present of all.

314
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,844
I can trust again.

315
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,549
You're welcome.

316
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,863
Oh, sir, much more wine.

317
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,147
Henry, as New York's oldest hansom cab driver, you've seen quite a lot.

318
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:43,518
In your past 60 years on the job, what is your most exciting memory?

319
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:47,043
- Well...
- Ah, this is it.

320
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:48,700
Oh, boy, here we go.

321
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,261
Everyone, everyone, if I may direct your attention to the television.

322
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,526
You are about to see something amazing.

323
00:16:53,526 --> 00:17:01,756
And then, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.

324
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:04,256
Come on, baby.
Bring it home.

325
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,394
But the most exciting moment--

326
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,192
that would have to be this one, right now.

327
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,559
What?

328
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,736
Look at me.
I'm on TV.

329
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,224
I never thought I'd have my story told.

330
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:23,221
Thank you, Miss Robin Trubotsky.

331
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:24,737
Thank you.

332
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:28,787
And right then, Aunt Robin realized how important her job truly was.

333
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,504
It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.

334
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,464
You know, Metro News One may not be number one in viewership,

335
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:40,432
but this reporter takes pride in...
Whoa! Oh...!

336
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:43,795
Oh, my God, I'm covered in horse crap!

337
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,861
Oh, my God, it's in my hair.

338
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:50,087
- You planned that?
- No, Marshall.

339
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,800
That was beyond my wildest dreams.

340
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,566
So, if you ever come to Alabama,

341
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,432
my mom throws the huge crawfish boils,

342
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:01,998
and she's just dying to meet you, by the way.

343
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,465
Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say, and, uh, there's no good way to say it.

344
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,036
I want to break up.

345
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,910
I don't think you're the one for me.

346
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:15,038
I don't want to waste your time, because I really like you.

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,645
I want to do right by you, and I think the best way for me to do that is just to be honest.

348
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,478
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,961
Oh, God, just let it out.

350
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,131
They're only tears.

351
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,308
I'm not the one for you?!

352
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,704
I'm sorry, I just... I-I-I thought the mature thing to do...

353
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,166
- It's my birthday!
- Yes, I know.

354
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:41,927
I didn't realize...

355
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:45,985
It's my birthday, and you're telling me I'm not the one for you?!

356
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:48,881
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, the odds--

357
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,826
It's like you lost the lottery.

358
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:53,111
Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery?!

359
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,479
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.

360
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:58,633
- Okay, so what's the problem?!
- I... I... I can't explain it.

361
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,469
- Try!
- It's... ineffable.

362
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:04,359
I'm not effable?

363
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,077
No, no, no, no. "Ineffable."
Ineffable means it can't be explained.

364
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,598
- Oh, so I'm stupid?
- Oh, God, what's going on?

365
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:17,020
Okay, what's going on is you broke my heart over my answering machine on my birthday,

366
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,936
waited three years for me to get over you,

367
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:22,382
tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again,

368
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:27,292
only so you could dump me three weeks later, again, on my birthday!

369
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,767
No, it's-it's-it's not like that.

370
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,277
- I'm just... it's-it's-it's...
- What?!

371
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:35,676
I'm just, like, so busy right now.

372
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,157
Remember when Natalie said...

373
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:41,037
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

374
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,854
Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga.

375
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:47,478
It's a form of guerilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army.

376
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:55,365
This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar.

377
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,669
My knee!

378
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,114
It's in my hair!

379
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,732
But isn't nice to know people are watching?

380
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:10,838
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

381
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,570
What happened to you?

382
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,743
I told the truth.

383
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:18,011
Turns out the truth has a mean roundhouse kick.

384
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,374
Oh, man.

385
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:21,157
Oh, well, you did the right thing.

386
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:23,622
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm bleeding internally.

387
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:26,072
Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down?

388
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:28,888
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.

389
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,093
Please, can we just have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?

390
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,144
Fine.

391
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,122
Are you okay?

392
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:38,191
I really thought I was doing it the good way this time.

393
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,054
I guess there is no good way.

394
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:43,189
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to do the right thing,

395
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:45,092
you just end up flat on your back,

396
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,831
flailing around in a big pile of horse crap.

397
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,988
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the Internet now.

398
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,617
And that's how it ended with Natalie.

399
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:00,389
No happily ever after, just a whole lot of hurt.

400
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:05,702
And just like that, all those wonderful memories were replaced... by this one.

401
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,741
But, you know, bad as that night was,  within a year, Natalie was married.

402
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:12,227
And now she has three beautiful children.

403
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,020
So that's the upside of hurt.

404
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,616
Sometimes it happens for a reason.

405
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:21,689
So you got beat up by a girl?

406
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,317
Is that all you're taking away from this story?

407
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,044
You got beat up by a girl.

408
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,409
Hey, she knew Krav Maga.

409
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:36,785

1
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:16,331
So, kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf?

2
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,376
Why does he even ask?

3
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,418
I know, he's just going to tell us anyway.

4
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:20,633
I sure am.

5
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:24,089
It all began when Robin strolled into the bar and said...

6
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,164
Say you're my bitch.

7
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,254
I'm your bitch.

8
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,439
Why this time?

9
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:32,067
Because tonight I'm getting us all into Okay.

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,126
"Okay," awesome!

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,901
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,092
Okay is the name of a club.

13
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,130
Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive.

14
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:43,212
This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, couldn't get in.

15
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,117
A friend of yours named You?

16
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:48,113
No, a friend of mine named Shut Up.

17
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:50,129
Yeah, well, the owner goes to my gym.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,519
It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One.

19
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,153
So now I'm on the list for tonight.

20
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:56,776
Nice going, Sherbotsky.

21
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,608
You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.

22
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,859
He's even getting me into the V.I.P. room.

23
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:05,859
Yeah, he just wants to show you his own V.I.P., if you know what I mean.

24
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:09,822
All right, what does V.I.P. stand for in your little universe?

25
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:13,232
Well, I know that "P" is Penis.

26
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,851
Great, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshal and Lily?

27
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:18,955
Why was this funny?

28
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,102
I'll explain.

29
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:22,734
You see, Lily was a kindergarten teacher,

30
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:25,529
and so one fateful nap time...

31
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,242
Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming little bed and breakfast.

32
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,973
It was so nice.

33
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,631
What did you do this weekend?

34
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,967
Go, come on, chug, chug, chug!

35
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,278
Ten seconds!

36
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,281
Suck it, losers!

37
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,686
You know, quiet time with the fianc�.

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,651
I don't know, I just felt embarrassed.

39
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:54,427
Claire is my age and she and her husband do all this classy grownup stuff.

40
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:57,642
Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.

41
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,925
That's some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.

42
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,143
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.

43
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:06,029
Maybe we should have a wine-tasting party.

44
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,360
I like wine.

45
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:08,957
I like tasting.

46
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,925
You know I can party. Let's do it. Let's rock it. Maturity style.

47
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:17,734
And ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...

48
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,998
All the things you do when you know where your next thousand lays are coming from.

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,323
So, no, Lily and Marshall will not be joining us.

50
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,041
Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story:

51
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:28,715
My friend Kelly's going to be there.

52
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,266
Kelly, who supposedly I'm going to love.

53
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,013
Oh, you are going to love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment...

54
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,807
Translation: She's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.

55
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,097
Oh, and she's totally hot.

56
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,676
Okay, I guess I could take her off your hands for an evening.

57
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:44,250
Hmm...

58
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,846
So do you have any other hot, single friends?

59
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,330
No. Kelly...

60
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:52,699
Oh, no, Ted, your blazer!

61
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:53,541
What, what, what?

62
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:56,118
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.

63
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,492
- Love it. 
- Thank you.

64
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:00,486
And his hair was perfect.

65
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,107
We're wearing the same shirt.

66
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:06,599
Oh, wait, no, that's just my shirt reflected in yours.

67
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,511
One of the 24 similarities between girls and fish

68
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,169
is that they're both attracted to shiny objects.

69
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,275
You really never read my blog, do you?

70
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,517
All right, tin man, let's hit it.

71
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,230
All right, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.

72
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:21,083
What the hell happened to these two?

73
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:22,712
Marshall and I are just growing up.

74
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,410
Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too.

75
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,347
Like tonight, we're tasting all these different wines,

76
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:28,952
pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses.

77
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:36,172
Wow, who knew being in a committed heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay?

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,737
All right, cool kids are leaving now.

79
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,891
Grandma, Grandpa, don't wait up.

80
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:54,011
My, oh, my. There are some ferocious-looking cutlets here tonight.

81
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,141
All right, hookup strategy.

82
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,565
Colon, find a cutlet, lock her in early,

83
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:02,637
grind with her all night till she's mine.

84
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,854
Do these strategies ever work for you?

85
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,803
The question is: Do these strategies ever not work for me?

86
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,357
Either way, the answer is about half the time.

87
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,352
My bitches!

88
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,325
Check this out.

89
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,716
Um, they're with me.

90
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,701
Um, we're her bitches, too.

91
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,758
We'll wait here.

92
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:32,252
And with today's interest rate climate, you've got to go for the 30-year fixed mortgage.

93
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,588
- Oh, totally.
- Yeah.

94
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,857
So, Marshall, what about you?

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,598
You guys thinking house, baby?

96
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,985
Oh!

97
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:42,199
No, I think we're going to wait on the baby thing.

98
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,181
I mean, I love babies. Babies rule.

99
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,176
Pudgy arms and stuff...

100
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,327
But, uh, they make you old.

101
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,721
Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot... forever.

102
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:56,158
I'm three months pregnant.

103
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:59,388
Not awkward, guys.

104
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:02,306
Not awkward unless we let it be awkward.

105
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,638
This place seems great.

106
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:10,534
Is Kelly here?

107
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,928
Yeah, she's around somewhere.

108
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,904
Uh, let's go find her. I'll introduce you guys.

109
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,817
Then I should probably duck into the V.I.P. room.

110
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:21,067
It's so stupid and arbitrary, isn't it? Who gets to be a V.I.P. and who doesn't?

111
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,096
Can we come?

112
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,139
It's not that arbitrary.

113
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,942
Whoa, this place is loud.

114
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:29,965
You think?

115
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:21,130
Think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him?

116
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:26,291
Why? You'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty, with the...

117
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,364
Is that what you want?

118
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:32,911
Is this what you want?

119
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:37,427
"30-year fixed mortgage... I'm three months pregnant."

120
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:44,227
That was awkward.

121
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,884
Let's start drinking!

122
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,451
Not so fast.

123
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,296
In order for the tannins to mellow, we should let it breathe for about 30 minutes.

124
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,860
Freaking tannins.

125
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,893
Do you know what they're doing in there right now?

126
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,324
They're watching Claire's ultrasound video.

127
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,864
And I swear to God, even the baby looks bored.

128
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,398
Come on, it's not that bad.

129
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,876
We're really starting to click with these guys.

130
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:47,732
Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.

131
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,367
Are you honestly trying to get me excited about fondue?

132
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,648
It's dipping stuff in hot cheese. What's not to love?

133
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,998
Okay, that does sound good.

134
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,806
But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.

135
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:04,673
Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.

136
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,077
Marshall knew she was right.

137
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,244
He had to stop acting like a kid.

138
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,240
But not tonight.

139
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:16,317
Now, our apartment was on the third floor,

140
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:19,381
so I'm not sure if this part is actually true,

141
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:21,703
but Uncle Marshall swears it happened.

142
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,357
Taxi!

143
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,000
The new album is great.

144
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:13,180
It's all smooth and polished, not dark and heavy like the early stuff.

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,856
Oh, yeah, Nora Jones just gets better and better.

146
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,250
Please, tell me we can drink the wine now.

147
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,225
Five more minutes. We don't want to rush those tannins.

148
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,286
Freaking tannins.

149
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,845
I'm wetting my pants!

150
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:03,166
I think that's when I realized, clubs weren't awesome.

151
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,306
Clubs weren't even okay.

152
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,288
Clubs sucked.

153
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:09,965
I had to get out of there.

154
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,273
- Hey, Robin.
- Hey.

155
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:14,272
Why aren't you inside?

156
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,055
I'm calling the owner. There's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid V.I.P. room.

157
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,283
What are you doing here?

158
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,337
Oh, I had this move, so I came here to bust it.

159
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,472
Can you get me in?

160
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,618
Great. Voice mail.

161
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,606
Thanks, I'll see you!

162
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:30,312
Bye!

163
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,278
Oh, come on, he just got here.

164
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,142
He's probably famous.

165
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,824
Oh, yeah. Isn't there a third Affleck brother?

166
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,702
Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something?

167
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:43,143
Holy crap, we just saw Brian Affleck.

168
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:47,352
It's not like I care so much about getting into the V.I.P. room,

169
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:49,697
I have been in tons of V.I.P. rooms.

170
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,207
I'm not exactly a V.I.P. room virgin.

171
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:53,823
But seriously, call me back.

172
00:10:56,558 --> 00:11:00,341
Oh, um, I was just in there, Robin Sherbotsky. I'm on the list.

173
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,470
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.

174
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,857
But I'm Robin Sherbotsky.

175
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,798
I'm a reporter for Channel One.

176
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,255
There's a channel one?

177
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,536
Back of the line.

178
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,529
Should have snuck in with Brian Affleck.

179
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:52,238
Aah! Coat wench, do not uncheck that man's jacket!

180
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,835
Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a coat wench.

181
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,656
No, no, no, coat wench, I like it.

182
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:58,496
I should get a sign made up.

183
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,794
What are you doing here? Lily let you go?

184
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:02,990
Lily? Who cares, right?

185
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,481
- You are so dead.
- Oh, I am so dead.

186
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,710
- Wow, I'm going home.
- No, uh-uh.

187
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:09,381
I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line

188
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,537
to come down here and party with my bro.

189
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,027
Now, damn it, we're going to party.

190
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:14,271
All right, one beer.

191
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,117
Yes!

192
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:17,706
Finally, I don't have to wait a half an hour for a drink.

193
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:27,519
Oh, man, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this.

194
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:28,950
This is important to the story.

195
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:33,518
Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in.

196
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,991
Okay, so anyway...

197
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,997
Marshall, are you okay?

198
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,202
Again, I wasn't there, so I'm a little foggy on the details.

199
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,083
Taxi!

200
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,261
Hey.

201
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:32,357
Hey.

202
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,020
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.

203
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,322
Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kill him.

204
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:39,340
Actually, I can't even get myself in.

205
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,567
I was such a dork.

206
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:45,616
I get recognized one time, and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts.

207
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,450
I'm no V.I.P.

208
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,416
I'm not even an I.P.

209
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:53,661
I'm just a lowly little pea, sitting out here in the gutter.

210
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,576
You know something?

211
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,181
I'd take a pea in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day.

212
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,178
Hmm...

213
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,292
I broke my tooth!

214
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:17,674
Do you have...

215
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,655
...any aspirin?

216
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:21,617
Maybe there's...

217
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:23,587
a machine in...

218
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,457
...the restroom.

219
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,539
Now to this day, I don't know what happened in there,

220
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,322
but when Marshall came out a few minutes later...

221
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:50,621
Rough night?

222
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,564
Yeah.

223
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:55,075
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?

224
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,683
Why do I hate them so much?

225
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:01,389
Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like usually sucks.

226
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,430
Like these clubs... or cruises.

227
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,273
Or New Year's Eve.

228
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,987
Or the Super Bowl.

229
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,273
Or parades.

230
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:12,049
The Rockettes.

231
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,386
Or parades.

232
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:17,011
- You said that already.
- I really hate parades.

233
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:17,814
Okay.

234
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:23,303
He just left in the middle of our own party! You don't do that.

235
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:27,059
Unless, of course, you're chasing after somebody who's already done it,

236
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,574
and then... then I think it's okay.

237
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,646
Well, I hate to take his side, but come on, a wine tasting?

238
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:36,268
What's the big plan for next Saturday, Scrabble night?

239
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,566
Don't check your e-mail.

240
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,725
Why are you becoming this person?

241
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:45,232
I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.

242
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,994
Once on a dare.

243
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,062
The other times were just for fun.

244
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm not in college anymore.

245
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:57,142
I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards.

246
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:58,610
You can only go foreword.

247
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,192
Um, false.

248
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,180
You can go wherever you want.

249
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,371
I guess the question is, where do you want to go?

250
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,602
I want to go into this club and find my fianc�.

251
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,414
Well, that you can't do.

252
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,086
Want to bet?

253
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,217
Follow my lead.

254
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,074
Hey, big guy.

255
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:21,851
I said follow my lead.

256
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,441
- Please, please. Come on.
- Follow her lead. Do it, please.

257
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,868
- Follow her, please.
- Yes, please.

258
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:36,627
Those were the four greatest and only breasts I've ever seen.

259
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:45,664
Yeah, see, if everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it's usually not.

260
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:46,433
- Right!
- Right.

261
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:50,974
So, by that logic, if you and I were to say, go out on a date...

262
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,147
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.

263
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,384
Right. The DMV it is.

264
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,684
Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.

265
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,118
Sounds awful. It's a date.

266
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,075
Okay!

267
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:05,652
But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.

268
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:09,611
How many of these coats do you think I can put on all at once?

269
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:57,515
Okay, for the wedge...

270
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:18,910
Barney?

271
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:20,400
Ted.

272
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:22,177
Get your coat. We're leaving.

273
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,991
What... what happened to that, um... cutlet you were grinding with?

274
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:27,605
That was my cousin Leslie.

275
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:30,666
- What?!
- No, no, no.

276
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,576
We're not laughing about this, Ted.

277
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:35,879
This is not gonna be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months.

278
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:41,493
It's not gonna be like, "Hey, ha, remember that time when you were grinding with..." No.

279
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,037
And you know why?

280
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,906
Because-- italics -- this night did not happen.

281
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:50,000
You promise me you will never, ever, ever tell

282
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:52,733
another living soul what transpired here tonight.

283
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,285
- You promise.
- All right.

284
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:55,965
- Promise.
- All right, I promise.

285
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,731
- Get Marshall and go, okay?
- All right.

286
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,706
Hey, thanks for saving my night.

287
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,031
I'll talk to you soon?

288
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,397
Um, hey, tip her, Barney.

289
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,642
Why? I didn't check a coat.

290
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,172
And even if I did, on principle, tip jars have become so...

291
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:10,023
Funny story: Barney was grinding with this girl all night...

292
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:10,920
Fine!

293
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,923
I learned a new trick.

294
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:31,883
So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth.

295
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:33,500
It was nice.

296
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,954
And then it got... icky.

297
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:50,245
I'm really glad you guys came out tonight.

298
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,671
You know, dude, can I just say something?

299
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,926
It kind of hurt that you guys didn't invite me out.

300
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,659
I mean, I know things have changed since I got engaged,

301
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,932
but it would have been nice to be asked!

302
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,888
I'm sorry! I just assumed...

303
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:09,469
They played some good songs tonight!

304
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,404
I mean, lately...

305
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:16,601
I know, I know. It just seems like suddenly we're living in two different worlds.

306
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:19,187
Maybe you've got more in common with Barney.

307
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,134
What?

308
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,453
Are you crazy?

309
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,849
You think I like going to those clubs?

310
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:28,183
I'd so much rather go to your fruity little wine tasting.

311
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,790
Oh, God, I'm gonna barf.

312
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,776
Where's my purse? Where's my purse?

313
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,154
I'm okay.

314
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:39,718
The problem is, you can't do any of that couple stuff unless you have someone to do it with,

315
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:42,257
and the only way I'm gonna find that someone is by going out

316
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,705
and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.

317
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:45,698
What?

318
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:53,808
But, man, when I find her, we're gonna have some bad-ass wine tastings.

319
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:55,236
It's a plan.

320
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,067
Hey, maybe it'll be that cute coat check girl.

321
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,120
Yeah!

322
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:01,913
Maybe it will be.

323
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,454
It wasn't.

324
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:09,414
You know, Ted, I don't say this nearly enough, but I really...

325
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:11,733
That place has great salads!

326
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:24,266

1
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,719
Now, as you know, Aunt Robin is a big fan of Halloween--

2
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,718
always dressing up in crazy costumes--

3
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,023
but she wasn't always that way.

4
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:24,550
Back in 2005, she thought she was too cool for Halloween,

5
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,542
unlike Aunt Lily.

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,786
Guess what came in the mail today?

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,747
Our costumes?

8
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,361
- Do they rule?
- They rule.

9
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:35,851
And yours is 100% wool, so you won't get hypothermia like last year.

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,778
Tarzan nipples blue.

11
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,981
You know what I love about Halloween?

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,143
It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag.

13
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:48,251
If a girl dresses up as a witch, she's a slutty witch.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,032
If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat.

15
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,314
- If she's a nurse...
- Wow, we get it.

16
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:56,294
...she's a slutty nurse.

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,368
Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,745
Oh, I don't know.

19
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:02,469
Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.

20
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,355
Mike? There's a Mike?

21
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,596
You have a boyfriend and you haven't told us?

22
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:07,933
No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend.

23
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,909
He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.

24
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,003
Boyfriend!

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,514
So why haven't we met him?

26
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:16,089
We're not really ready to go public yet.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,985
Married.

28
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,148
How about we go on a Halloween double date?

29
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,150
I don't know, we were kind of thinking about staying at home

30
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:25,556
and dressing up as naked people.

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,135
Come on, Robin, trot out your new fella.

32
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,842
Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.

33
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:35,280
Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened.

34
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,446
- Your costumes came?
- Our cost... Yes.

35
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,293
That is why we're best friends.

36
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:41,417
Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?

37
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:42,520
Well...

38
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,564
What?

39
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,568
Every Halloween, Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.

40
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,316
That's right.

41
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:48,720
What's the "Slutty Pumpkin"?

42
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,167
You mean who is the Slutty Pumpkin.

43
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:53,118
It was four years ago...

44
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,694
I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building.

45
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,075
I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,530
appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.

47
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,210
Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?

48
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,888
It was carved in strategic places.

49
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,608
So, uh, we're at the bar, and I see her mix

50
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,395
- Kahlua...
- Kahlua and root beer.

51
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,340
A cocktail she invented herself.

52
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,265
And she called it... "The Tootsie Roll..."

53
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:19,163
Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.

54
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,124
Hey! Can I please tell the story?

55
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:22,988
So we had this instant connection.

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,745
She gave me her number, but then...

57
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,780
- Something went terribly wrong.
- Guys!

58
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,268
Then something went terribly wrong.

59
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,038
Happy Halloween.

60
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,577
Sonny, where's Cher?

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,648
Cher?

62
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,980
Right here, babe.

63
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,908
I just met the perfect woman.

64
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,552
She's funny, she's beautiful, she loves Star Wars.

65
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,402
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's her take on Ewoks?

66
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:48,973
- Loves 'em.
- Oh, good.

67
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,985
I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks.

68
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:53,553
The rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.

69
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,121
And get this: She's a marine biologist.

70
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,283
She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.

71
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:58,701
Oh, penguins are cool.

72
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,411
Kind of like black and white Ewoks.

73
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,660
I approve.

74
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,727
Hey, where's my, uh, Kit-Kat? I put it right here on this table.

75
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,712
I don't know, but we've plenty of chocolate here.

76
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:09,110
No, no, you don't understand. I need that Kit-Kat--

77
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,486
she wrote her nuer on that wrapper. Where is it?

78
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,765
Uh-oh.

79
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,532
Hey, Dracula! Come on, give me the... give me it!

80
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,484
Where's the Kit-Kat?

81
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,368
Where's the Kit-Kat?!

82
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:27,958
Never found her number, never saw her again.

83
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,558
But every year, they have a Halloween party up on the roof,

84
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:31,694
so that's where I'll be.

85
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,480
You know, Ted, it's been four years.

86
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,881
She could be engaged or married,

87
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:38,867
or, God forbid, fat.

88
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:41,453
I don't know, I got a feeling--

89
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:42,753
this could be the year.

90
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,190
Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.

91
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,498
All right, bring the mockery, fine, I can take it.

92
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,071
But come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever

93
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,706
if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?

94
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,132
Oh, on the off-chance that that could happen,

95
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:59,086
maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.

96
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,057
- That's a really good point.
- That's a good idea.

97
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:06,664
Ted, is your world ready to be rocked, rocked, rocked?

98
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,163
Can't wait.

99
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,845
So... what do you think?

100
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,491
So, what do you think?

101
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:18,159
Wow.

102
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,216
Marshall, are you wearing eyeliner?

103
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:21,318
Oh, yeah.

104
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,017
Weirdly hot, right?

105
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,668
We are so going to win the costume contest this year.

106
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:29,648
First prize: $50 gift certificate at the bar.

107
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,609
And how much did you pay for your costumes?

108
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:32,807
$100.

109
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:33,960
Each.

110
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,256
Well, I think you guys look great.

111
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,453
What are you going as?

112
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,681
Oh, like I even need to ask.

113
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,454
Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me, and she knows me as...

114
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,180
a hanging chad.

115
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,608
What? She thought it was hilarious.

116
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,981
Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.

117
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,979
What a sad commentary on our national attention span--

118
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,278
that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.

119
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,739
Sad commentary.

120
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,229
All right, Polly got to pee.

121
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,521
Again?

122
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,347
Where you going?

123
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,881
It's an elaborate costume.

124
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:38,108
No, no, not again, not this year. You're going as my wingman.

125
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,244
Flight suit up.

126
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,162
No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.

127
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:43,858
Oh, you're dangerous, Maverick.

128
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:46,668
Your ego's writing checks your body can't cash.

129
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,317
Okay.

130
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,158
Here's the plan, and I crap you not.

131
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:57,109
I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween Party.

132
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:01,184
Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.

133
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:04,000
We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year.

134
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,893
Tonight I'm going up to the roof, I'm going to have a few beers,

135
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,511
I'm going to wait for the Slutty Pumpkin.

136
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:09,929
It's just what I do.

137
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:14,792
Hmm. Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties...

138
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,503
or Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group.

139
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,487
What's that, left hand?

140
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,668
"Right hand sucks"? Word.

141
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,568
Heading up to the roof.

142
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,519
Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us.

143
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,396
What's that? "Self five"? Nice. We out.

144
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,554
Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?

145
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,842
Hey, word play, funny.

146
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,001
Whoo, nice outfit.

147
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,171
- I'm a parrot. 
- You sure are.

148
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,809
- Where's Mike?
- He's meeting me here.

149
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,113
I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village.

150
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,954
There are, like, a zillion gay pirates this year.

151
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,935
Seriously, does my eyeliner look okay?

152
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,079
Yes, it's weirdly hot.

153
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,163
So, where's your costume?

154
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,862
Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together,

155
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,329
but we decided not to dress up.

156
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:04,690
Oh, geez.

157
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:05,545
Hi.

158
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,995
Uh, everyone, this is Michael.

159
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,059
That is not his real hair.

160
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,600
Um, where's your costume, Gretel?

161
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,140
You thought I was...

162
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,615
Oh, I was just kidding. I've got to stop making jokes in e-mails.

163
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:20,124
It's so hard to convey tone.

164
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,442
I think we got them beat.

165
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,803
I can't believe you talked me into this.

166
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,632
I didn't. You followed me up here.

167
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,688
This party sucks.

168
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,053
There's seven chicks here.

169
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,926
There's six chicks here.

170
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:43,001
Relax. The night is young. It's going to get better.

171
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,724
Ladies and gentlemen, as on pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95,

172
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,019
it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shaggarats.

173
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:18,473
What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?

174
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,559
Arr-gyle.

175
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:29,072
And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?

176
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,232
Arr-by's.

177
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:35,011
'Twould think it would be Arby's.

178
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,973
But, actually, it's Long John Silver's.

179
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,011
Actually, I kind of need this hand to eat.

180
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:41,907
Oh..

181
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,241
Oh, yeah.

182
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,807
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm starrr... ving!

183
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,203
It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.

184
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,559
Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together.

185
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:01,338
We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's...

186
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,645
- This cheeseburger is so...
- Good. See?

187
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:09,744
I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby.

188
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,710
This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chops.

189
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:14,922
That may be true,

190
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:19,049
but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard

191
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,840
it threw up a little bit.

192
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,235
Robin, you have to try this chicken.

193
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,621
Oh, that's good, I'm okay, thanks.

194
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,316
It's really tasty.

195
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,081
I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.

196
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,004
Come on, just try a little bite.

197
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:39,743
Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.

198
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,597
Oh, for God's sakes.

199
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,108
Really tasty.

200
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:03,588
Hey.

201
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,929
Hey.

202
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:10,464
So what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here?

203
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,649
Yeah.

204
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,062
Right. 'Cause I'm wearing a lei.

205
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,906
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.

206
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,374
Let's bail.

207
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,262
No, Barney, come on. I'm having fun.

208
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,740
Plus, it's really great to see all these guys again.

209
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,726
Name one person you know at this party.

210
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:36,488
Well, there's Ninja, Back of Horse.

211
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,417
Hey, where's Front of Horse? That guy's a riot-- where is he?

212
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,562
Okay, I'm leaving.

213
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,905
But just know, that this Victoria Secret party is on a yacht.

214
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:48,157
And what will be sticking to that yacht?

215
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,730
The "Barnacle."

216
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:51,686
Really?

217
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,436
- That's your nickname now?
- Yeah, the Barnacle.

218
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:54,773
- The Barnacle?
- That's it.

219
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:57,338
Barnacle, out.

220
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,946
Have fun, Barnacle.

221
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,902
So... do you like Mike?

222
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:05,499
Do you like Mike?

223
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:07,384
Of course I do. Why?

224
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,186
It just doesn't seem like it.

225
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,698
You won't share your food, you won't wear a costume.

226
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:15,351
Oh, Lily, you know me. I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.

227
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:18,412
Okay, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside,

228
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:22,452
but it's kind of the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it.

229
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,873
If you just gave it a chance, you might like it.

230
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:26,947
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?

231
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,625
Robin, Mike likes you.

232
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:32,536
If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.

233
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,572
What?

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,541
Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for a night.

235
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,740
Okay, well, what am I supposed to do,

236
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,936
buy him a giant teddy bear or something?

237
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:47,647
How about you start by sharing dessert?

238
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,763
I can share dessert.

239
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:50,821
Good.

240
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:53,719
He better want the brownie sundae,

241
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,958
but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.

242
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:05,511
Barney?

243
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:06,475
What, you're back?

244
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:07,410
That's right.

245
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,213
In a totally new costume.

246
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,372
Every Halloween I bring a spare costume,

247
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,968
in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party.

248
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:18,372
That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.

249
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,518
What's with the face?

250
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,935
It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.

251
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,532
So go to the bathroom.

252
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,313
No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the "Slutty Pumpkin."

253
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,761
So pee off the roof.

254
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,937
Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.

255
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,385
Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you, there's people walking down there.

256
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:36,917
Come on, Ted, who you gonna listen to?

257
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,534
Me, or Mr. Goody-Goody over there?

258
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,478
Yeah, whatever, you guys got some weed?

259
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:46,154
A little to the left, Marshall.

260
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,501
Lily, squat down.

261
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,303
This is gonna be a slaughter.

262
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:53,203
None of these other costumes even come close to ourrr...s!

263
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:54,556
Take the damn picture.

264
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,188
Got it.

265
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,368
I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher.

266
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:02,882
Maybe if I'd worn the red dress. Huh.

267
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,637
If I could turn back time.

268
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,052
Wow, this sundae looks so good. I could eat the whole thing.

269
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:16,056
But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.

270
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,407
Apple tart? Excellent choice, Lily-pad.

271
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,325
Thanks, Marshmallow.

272
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:24,759
Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.

273
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,787
Let me guess.

274
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,105
Every guy's used the lei'd line on you tonight, huh?

275
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:34,789
You wouldn't believe.

276
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,679
I apologize for my gender.

277
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,942
Let me make it up to you-- make you a drink?

278
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:41,421
You certainly are a charming devil.

279
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:45,046
I'm also a "horny" devil.

280
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:46,729
Yeah.

281
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,869
No.

282
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,715
Oh, go to hell.

283
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,882
You know, if you guys like tiramisu, we found this little Italian place...

284
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:04,896
No, you found it.

285
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,380
I came with you.

286
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:07,584
Go on.

287
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,404
I'm just saying, we love tiramisu.

288
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,161
I cannot get enough of it.

289
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,693
We're crazy for the stuff.

290
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm crazy, and you're crazy...

291
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,253
...for tiramisu.

292
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:19,607
Right.

293
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,321
We love tiramisu.

294
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:22,745
Am I wrong saying that?

295
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:25,944
No, no, no. I mean, it just sounds a little bit weird. Doesn't it?

296
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,526
We love tiramisu?

297
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,478
Isn't really a group activity.

298
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:30,918
Loving tiramisu?

299
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,340
Right?

300
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:38,653
So this Italian place, how is their cannoli?

301
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:42,083
Easy there, hungry.

302
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,798
Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.

303
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,804
- Hey, is that Gary Oldman?
- Wait... where?

304
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:57,192
I don't see...

305
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:04,391
Brain freeze.

306
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,592
- Okay, Victoria Secret party, right now.
- Nope.

307
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:13,791
Come on. I can't stand watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween.

308
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,136
Ted, the "Slutty Pumpkin" is not coming.

309
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,415
She might.

310
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,052
Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds. It's about believing.

311
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:24,819
This girl, she... she represents something to me. I don't know.

312
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:26,054
Hope.

313
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:28,383
Wow.

314
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,069
I did not understand a word you just said.

315
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:37,687
Lingerie models on a boat!

316
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,336
See ya.

317
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,782
No. See ya.

318
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:43,893
Ow!

319
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,495
Want to drink the melty part?

320
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,188
You know what? It's getting late.

321
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:52,677
I think I'm gonna take off.

322
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,457
Hey.

323
00:15:56,062 --> 00:16:00,071
I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel.

324
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,738
Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.

325
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,028
I like being with you.

326
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,923
Not as much as you like being alone.

327
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:06,819
You like...

328
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,104
eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.

329
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:11,997
Who uses ink?

330
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:13,905
Sorry.

331
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:18,351
Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways, that doesn't mean that this won't work.

332
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,423
Actually, it kind of does.

333
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:22,832
Wait, are we breaking up?

334
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,826
No, we aren't breaking up.

335
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:28,841
I'm breaking up with you.

336
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:35,752
And then just as I was about to lose hope...

337
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:44,005
She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.

338
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,376
Kahlua, root beer...

339
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:50,586
Could this penguin be the "Slutty Pumpkin?"

340
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,137
Uh, excuse me.

341
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,298
This is going to sound crazy, but

342
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:03,386
I met someone up on this roof four years ago, and

343
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:06,940
they mixed that cocktail, and-and they loved penguins.

344
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,404
By any chance, was that you?

345
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:13,738
It's you.

346
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:18,213
- Everyone thought I was crazy, but I came...
- You are such a loser.

347
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:21,152
Come on, I came back for you, Ted.

348
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,797
I penguin-suited up to show you the ror of your ways.

349
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:28,028
And to score Hula Girl's number. Check and check.

350
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,573
- Unbelievable.
- Yes, it is.

351
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:34,680
Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.

352
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:38,136
What? No, No, that's some other guy, and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot.

353
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,596
I cannot believe I gave you my number.

354
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,862
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.

355
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:41,887
Yeah. Well, give it back.

356
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,241
Well, uh, I don't think so. I earned it, fair and square. I'm calling you.

357
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,811
But I'm never gonna go out with you.

358
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,630
But how will you know it's me?

359
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,836
I'm a master of disguise.

360
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah.

361
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,646
Nice.

362
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,964
Come on, Ted. Victoria Secret party, now, let's go.

363
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,443
I'm staying.

364
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:04,606
Fine!

365
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,228
Fine...

366
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,385
What are you doing?

367
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,721
I'm flippering you off.

368
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,845
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

369
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:20,989
Seriously, it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a we, and I wanted to be an I.

370
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:23,038
Dudes are such chicks.

371
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,105
You guys, I'm fine.

372
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,730
Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.

373
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:33,473
And the winners of this year's costume contest are...

374
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,489
Lily Aldren as a parrot,

375
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:37,677
and Marshall Erikson as a gay pirate!

376
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,834
Oh, yeah!

377
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,826
Wait, what did he say?

378
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:41,542
Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!

379
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,460
Wait. Gay pirate-- where are you getting that from?

380
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,093
Dude, you're wearing eyeliner.

381
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,113
Okay. I just want everybody here to know I'm not a gay pirate.

382
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,007
I have sex with my parrot all the time.

383
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,619
That came out wrong.

384
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:57,690
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter. We won!

385
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:01,003
- I love you, marshmallow.
- I love you, too, Lily Pad.

386
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,035
You guys, let me get a picture.

387
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,070
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

388
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,284
Oh, hey.

389
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,099
If you're here for the Shaggarats, you just missed the fourth encore.

390
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:28,528
I never played any team sports.

391
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:32,706
Are we playing "I never"? 'Cause there's nothing left but peach schnapps.

392
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,595
I played tennis in high school.

393
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,730
You know why?

394
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,365
Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles.

395
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,439
I just got dumped.

396
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,069
Oh, man, that sucks.

397
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,780
Yeah. It's okay.

398
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,399
I wasn't that into him.

399
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,959
Story of my life.

400
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:54,042
Everyone else is off falling in love and acting stupid

401
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,656
and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me.

402
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,982
Why don't I want that more?

403
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:01,972
I want to want that.

404
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:04,421
Am I wired wrong or something?

405
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,694
No.

406
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,041
Look, you didn't want to be with me, so, clearly, you have abysmal taste in men.

407
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:13,734
But you're wired just fine.

408
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,367
Well, what if I'm just a... a cold person?

409
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:23,179
Tonight Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but

410
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,776
I couldn't be Gretel.

411
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:26,744
Why can't I be Gretel?

412
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,620
Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet.

413
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:33,962
Hey, one day, you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.

414
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:34,925
Really?

415
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:37,080
Yeah. He's out there somewhere.

416
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:40,495
- Just like the Slutty Pumpkin... Pumpkin, pumpkin...

417
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,803
How do you do this, Ted?

418
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:47,428
How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold,

419
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:50,413
and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?

420
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,764
Well, I'm pretty drunk.

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,558
Look, I know that odds are, the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door

422
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:04,231
in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning, but

423
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:07,900
this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know,

424
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:09,992
sit and wait.

425
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,722

1
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:16,910
Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching,

2
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,605
I learned something valuable.

3
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:20,544
That love is not a science.

4
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,092
Wow, that was a great story, Dad.

5
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,152
We're going to go watch TV.

6
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:28,736
You see, sometimes in life you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained.

7
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:30,437
And that's kind of scary.

8
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,169
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,481
I know, I'm still shaking.

10
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,105
What the...?

11
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,078
Joke's on you, I have a cold.

12
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,491
Are you guys okay?

13
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,621
Another round, and back it up for me and Lily!

14
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:41,746
What happened?

15
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,983
We saw something up in the apartment.

16
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:46,694
Something bad.

17
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,004
I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.

18
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,841
Oh, muchos sexy.

19
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,788
Yo quiero, Marshall.

20
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,105
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:08,351
What was it?

22
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:11,883
Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.

23
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:12,905
Mouse?

24
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,460
Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.

25
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,530
That was a huge cockroach.

26
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,002
Baby, it was a mouse.

27
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:19,115
It had whiskers.

28
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:22,326
But those things coming out of its head, those were antennae.

29
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:24,350
Marshall ran away from a cockroach.

30
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:26,116
It was a mouse.

31
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:28,178
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

32
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,183
Oh, my story is on. Ted, pay attention.

33
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:32,653
Carl, turn it up.

34
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:36,208
I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker.

35
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:40,830
Ellen, your company, Love Solutions, boasts 100% success rate.

36
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,102
What's your secret?

37
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,407
Science.

38
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:47,622
Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.

39
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:51,012
All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm,

40
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:55,156
and presto manifesto, you have a soul mate, and it works!

41
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:58,918
Just ask all of my happy couples.

42
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,129
And these are just the attractive ones.

43
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:02,842
I have more photos in the bathroom.

44
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,980
Love Solutions, Ellen Pierce.

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,867
A beacon of hope for New York City's lovelorn.

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,913
Robin Scherbotsky...

47
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,491
Was that chick at the end really a client?

48
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,105
Yes.

49
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,095
We're signing up.

50
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,753
What?

51
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,977
Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

52
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,641
That's a perfect cocktail.

53
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,965
Shake well, then sleep with.

54
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,581
I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up.

55
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,760
It's the man version of getting a cat.

56
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,839
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur, and only mammals have fur.

57
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:31,282
It was a cockroach.

58
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,330
Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach

59
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:36,204
is if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.

60
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,841
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:41,841
Come on.

62
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:55,089
Ted! Hurry! You've got to help me.

63
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,159
- My boat is sinking!
- What?

64
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,844
- My boat is sinking!
- You have a boat?

65
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,228
Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction.

66
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,308
I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle.

67
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,851
If I don't get down there right now, it's going to capsize. Now come on!

68
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,411
Your boat is sinking. That was good.

69
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,345
Come on, Ted. This is an incredible opportunity.

70
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:18,576
We'll meet our soul mates, nail 'em and never call 'em again.

71
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,396
All finished, gentlemen?

72
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:22,998
Congratulations.

73
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,988
You have just taken your very first step.

74
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:26,431
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.

75
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:28,167
I sure hope this works.

76
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:33,181
I'm so done with the single life-- all the games, the meaningless sex.

77
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,488
You deserve more.

78
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,944
That is so true, Ellen.

79
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:43,485
I really think I'm ready to stop being a me, and start being a we.

80
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:46,492
Hey, is there any way I can let it be known that I love cuddling?

81
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,125
Ah, of course you can. That is so... Oh.

82
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,736
Kind of hard to talk about with Ted here, but

83
00:03:55,817 --> 00:04:00,547
I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night...

84
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,588
when the tears come.

85
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,316
Ellen, can you help me find her?

86
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,617
Get out.

87
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:08,871
What?

88
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:12,019
I get 15 guys like you every week.

89
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,282
Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call 'em again.

90
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,608
Oh, my God, people do that?

91
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,764
Do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?

92
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:24,463
What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

93
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,555
No, that's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.

94
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,492
Okay, Ted, let's go.

95
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,240
Not you. You stay.

96
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,187
You're cute.

97
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,872
You're an architect.

98
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:41,211
Good career, and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application,

99
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:43,953
like your friend Jack Package.

100
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,678
- It's pronounced pa-codge.
- Get out of here!

101
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:52,170
You, I can work with. You give me three days,

102
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,566
and I will find the woman you will marry.

103
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,655
Uh, no thanks.

104
00:04:57,744 --> 00:04:59,588
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

105
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,022
It's New York City, you know-- plenty of fish in the sea.

106
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,624
Plenty of fish in the sea.

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,969
Yes, there's nine million people in New York, 4.5 million women.

108
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,858
Of course, you want to meet somebody roughly your own age.

109
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,733
Let's say, plus, minus, five years.

110
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:20,340
So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000.

111
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:24,343
But, uh, wait... 48% of those are already in relationships,

112
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,174
and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility,

113
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:31,043
and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives,

114
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,602
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

115
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:38,814
And then that leaves us with eight women.

116
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,038
That can't be right. Eight?

117
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,548
Really? Eight?

118
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:47,854
There are eight fish in that big blue ocean, Ted.

119
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:51,853
And if you feel confident that you could reel one in to your boat without me,

120
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,418
there's the door.

121
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,583
Do you take credit cards?

122
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:01,849
Okay, it's back. And this time we got a good look.

123
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:04,529
Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.

124
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,273
It's bigger now.

125
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,052
It's been feeding.

126
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,286
We were just upstairs watching TV.

127
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,586
Oh, gosh.

128
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:24,380
Okay, let's do this.

129
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,492
Shh, shh, shh.

130
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,697
It's okay.

131
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,048
It's over.

132
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,222
Oh, God!

133
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,271
So did you get a good look at it?

134
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:54,281
Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton, like a roach.

135
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,833
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

136
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,716
Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

137
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,316
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

138
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,198
It's a cock-a-mouse.

139
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,214
What?

140
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:12,282
It's some sort of mutant combination of the two.

141
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,564
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse, you know...

142
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:19,830
Did the horizontal, ten-legged, interspecies cha-cha?

143
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,691
That's impossible. That simply can't happen.

144
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,786
- Oh, but it can.
- And it has.

145
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,136
And it's pissed.

146
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,450
Dude, is everything okay? You left the front door open.

147
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,946
There was no time.

148
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,995
So, Love Solutions?

149
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,508
Did you meet the love of your life?

150
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:40,764
She said it'd take three days. It's been five days.

151
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,664
Should I be worried?

152
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,311
Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

153
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,598
Did you just use my name as a verb?

154
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:50,632
Oh, yeah. We do that behind your back.

155
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,479
"Ted out," to overthink.

156
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,265
Also see "Ted up."

157
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:57,454
"Ted up"-- to overthink something with disastrous results.

158
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,886
Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when he tried...

159
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,915
Okay, I get it.

160
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,430
Don't worry. I'm not going to Ted anything up. Or out.

161
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:07,642
I should give it a few more days.

162
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,701
Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.

163
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,622
Ted, hi. I, uh, meant to call you.

164
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:16,863
The computer is still crunching the numbers.

165
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:18,978
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

166
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,541
You said it was going to be three days.

167
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:21,515
Did I?

168
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:22,989
Three days? Really?

169
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,711
Yeah, and when someone says you're going to meet the perfect woman in three days,

170
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,232
you kind of put that in your date book, so...

171
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,423
How do I say this? This is going to be really hard.

172
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:38,077
Ted... there are absolutely no women out there for you.

173
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,146
Phew, actually, I got through that okay.

174
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,611
There're no women out there for me? I thought you said there were eight.

175
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,072
I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.

176
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,678
But... I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute.

177
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,085
I'm a cute architect.

178
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,726
How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate.

179
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,232
That's my hook.

180
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,440
I could maybe find somebody for you if you were gay.

181
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:01,228
Well, I'm not.

182
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:03,258
- A little bi maybe?
- No!

183
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:05,715
You're messing with me, right?

184
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,100
Come see for yourself.

185
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:13,807
I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher.

186
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:17,425
And look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6.

187
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,192
There's a 9.6 right there.

188
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,325
Don't touch the computer.

189
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,319
Yes, Sarah O'Brien.

190
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:28,066
I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.

191
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,210
Well, what about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

192
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,203
8.5.

193
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:33,250
So he sucks.

194
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,893
No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.

195
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,708
Oh, sure, it's good.

196
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,871
It's solid, but a 9.6?

197
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,884
9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up.

198
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,533
Ted, look, I have a lunch.

199
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:52,660
Please, I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope.

200
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:56,083
There are new women turning 18 every day.

201
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:27,345
It's a whole new species-- the cock-a-mouse.

202
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,115
And it's the size of a potato.

203
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,349
So what, now it's a cock-a-potato-mouse?

204
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,360
Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cock-a-mouse.

205
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:43,600
My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person.

206
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,855
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch, she wants to have two children.

207
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:51,093
Her guilty pleasure song is "Summer Breeze" by Seals and Crofts.

208
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,131
Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.

209
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:58,412
And like the majestic seahorse, it's hermaphroditic.

210
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,712
Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.

211
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,063
For as much as we know about the cock-a-mouse,

212
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:07,321
there's still so much we don't know.

213
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:11,212
Well, we know that there's no such thing as the cock-a-mouse.

214
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:14,587
What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.

215
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,494
So you really don't believe in the cock-a-mouse?

216
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,064
Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal,

217
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,529
but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know?

218
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,879
Like the Loch Ness Monster.

219
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:32,015
If by "like the Loch Ness Monster," you mean totally exists and is awesome,

220
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,467
then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness Monster.

221
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:40,263
Its diet is not unlike our own-- grains, cereals-- and it's awfully fond of cheese.

222
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:43,220
Okay, this is getting weird. The similarities go on and on.

223
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,960
She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies, too.

224
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:49,381
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

225
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:54,173
You want to be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend, it's uncanny.

226
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,605
All right.

227
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,407
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?

228
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,551
See what my 9.6 looks like in person?

229
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,392
As, you know, a frame of reference.

230
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:05,715
And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

231
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,545
That's right. I did the math.

232
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:12,874
Hi.

233
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,801
Hi. I'm Dr. O'Brien.

234
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,216
I'm Architect Mosby.

235
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:18,802
Sorry, I just wanted to say my job, too.

236
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,303
Hi, I'm Ted.

237
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,163
Hi. So what are we doing today?

238
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,581
Right, I, uh, I have a kind of mole on my back.

239
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:26,963
It's probably nothing, but I'm a cautious guy.

240
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,835
I'm exactly the same.

241
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:38,178
Summer breeze makes me feel fine

242
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:43,542
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

243
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,747
Sorry about that.

244
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,939
"Summer Breeze" is my guilty pleasure song.

245
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:52,056
It's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend...

246
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,587
at brunch.

247
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,607
I love brunch.

248
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,456
It's the best.

249
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:00,491
As long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.

250
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:03,952
I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.

251
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:08,825
Hey, this may sound weird, but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off.

252
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,485
So I'm going to ask you now.

253
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,113
Do you want to have dinner with me Saturday night?

254
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:18,630
That's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.

255
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,323
Friday night?

256
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:28,064
Wow. You're getting married. Congratulations.

257
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,145
Thank you.

258
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,331
I'm really sorry I asked you out, it just felt like

259
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,523
there could be this weird connection between us.

260
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,155
How crazy am I coming off here?

261
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,566
Only a little.

262
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:41,285
Well... if by some million-to-one long shot and I'm not rooting for this--

263
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:44,247
you wind up not getting married this weekend,

264
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,913
give me a call.

265
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,037
Okay.

266
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,260
But it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.

267
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,185
I'm sure you do.

268
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,537
Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap.

269
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,974
You think the roadrunner's going to fall for it?

270
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,819
Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.

271
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,962
But Marshall and I, we're believers.

272
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,085
We believe.

273
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:10,456
Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome.

274
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,763
You've got the Bermuda Triangle, ghosts, Bigfoot.

275
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:17,190
Bad maps, creaky houses, hillbilly in a gorilla suit.

276
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:18,590
Aliens.

277
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:21,455
Oh, come on, you've got to give me aliens.

278
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,662
Stonehenge, Area 51, there's alien crap all over the place.

279
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,610
You can't be serious.

280
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,186
My friend, you just poked the bear.

281
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:38,231
So my 9.6-- beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.

282
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,741
Oh, Ted. I'm so sorry.

283
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,201
Yeah, it was a long shot.

284
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:45,067
I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mind, but I don't know.

285
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,993
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not skip over this.

286
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:52,653
Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.

287
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,388
Come on, Lily. Don't hate the player, hate the game.

288
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:05,704
"On the night of July 2, 1947, conditions we clear over Roswell, New Mexico..."

289
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, geez.

290
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,036
Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you.

291
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,059
Dr. O'Brien.

292
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,263
What?

293
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,772
"When suddenly an array of..."

294
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,135
Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien.

295
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:20,187
About today, listen, I really need to talk to you.

296
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,400
Call me. I'll be at the office all day.

297
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,272
The doctor will see you now.

298
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,053
What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?

299
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:36,959
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.

300
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,429
Yeah, an 8.5 guy.

301
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,027
Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it,

302
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,668
I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.

303
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:50,273
In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.

304
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:51,737
Happy ending.

305
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:53,891
Look, I have to go down there.

306
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,551
I don't know what's going to happen when I get there, but I've got to give it a shot.

307
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,301
All right, see you later. Happy hunting.

308
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:02,670
Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cock-a-mouse?

309
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,172
Yeah, we're going to go make some crop circles.

310
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,841
Oh, my God!

311
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,081
Holy crap buckets. We got it.

312
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,474
What do we do with it?

313
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,426
Calm down. I have a plan.

314
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:20,523
I told my friend Sadip about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department.

315
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,232
But it has to be alive.

316
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:23,558
Wait, no, no!

317
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,356
They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean.

318
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:30,080
Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?

319
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,174
Hello again.

320
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,574
I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.

321
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,800
Go ahead, Sarah. You can tell me anything.

322
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:49,003
You have a basal cell carcinoma.

323
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,327
Anything else?

324
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,772
Your mole. The biopsy came back.

325
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:59,725
It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.

326
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,888
Wait, then you're still getting married?

327
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,593
Of course I'm still getting married.

328
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,661
But we're a 9.6.

329
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,270
Excuse me?

330
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:11,979
Okay. I went to Love Solutions, and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer,

331
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,663
that you and I are a 9.6.

332
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,634
Your fianc� is only an 8.5.

333
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,194
You looked at my file?

334
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,710
I had to. You're my only match.

335
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:20,997
Aren't you even a little curious?

336
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,929
The woman who set you up with your fianc�, thinks we're a better match.

337
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:27,306
I am getting married on Saturday.

338
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,376
Summer breeze...

339
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:32,497
Ted.

340
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:34,532
Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive

341
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:36,413
marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?

342
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,106
Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you

343
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,262
to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?

344
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,716
See? We're both impulsive.

345
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:45,056
We're perfect for each other.

346
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:46,422
Ted, just calm down.

347
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,799
Calm down?! You're my only match.

348
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:53,905
God, there was a computer and there were eight fish in a sea full of lesbians and...

349
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,279
Okay, Ted, Ted.

350
00:17:56,498 --> 00:18:00,727
Do you honestly believe, deep down, that there is no one else out there for you

351
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,392
just because some computer says so?

352
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:10,122
I didn't used to. But there was math, I got confused.

353
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:14,885
Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling.

354
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:19,820
When you fall in love with someone, an 8.5 equals a perfect ten.

355
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,392
You're right.

356
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:27,462
If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.

357
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,406
Brace yourself, dude.

358
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:31,861
This is going to blow your mind hole.

359
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,525
You bastard.

360
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,235
I actually got excited about this.

361
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,211
What?

362
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:40,579
It's empty.

363
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,824
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...

364
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:47,840
Lily.

365
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,165
Robin!

366
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,163
What?

367
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,613
Oh, my God.

368
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,476
It's real.

369
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,925
No, is it?

370
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,555
Do something.

371
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,935
What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?

372
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,821
It was the only thing I could think of.

373
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,044
Lily! Thank God.

374
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,846
Lily, I love you.

375
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,374
Robin, open up the window!

376
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:25,110
Open the window! Ah!

377
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,500
It can fly.

378
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,335
Wow.

379
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,456
Be free, mutant beast.

380
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:37,897
I'll miss this private war of ours.

381
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:42,652
I grew to admire your tenacious... Holy mother of God, it's headed this way!

382
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:52,787
Hi, Ellen.

383
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:56,717
I think I want my money back.

384
00:19:58,301 --> 00:19:59,570
I'm a failure.

385
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,543
I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted.

386
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,532
I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program.

387
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,846
Last night I stood out on the street for five hours

388
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:14,064
showing your photo to random pedestrians. No takers.

389
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:18,058
Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price

390
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:22,821
because you kind of look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.

391
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,664
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of ice cream, isn't that a bit clich�?

392
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:29,184
It's for the bourbon.

393
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:33,076
This isn't hopeless. You're going to find someone for me.

394
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,019
No, I won't.

395
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,971
You're going to die alone.

396
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,385
I'm not going to die alone.

397
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:41,724
Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive.

398
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,585
You just got to get back out there and keep looking.

399
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,484
No, you're never going to find anybody.

400
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,179
And every year you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.

401
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:51,948
You're being ridiculous. I'm going to be up on that wall one of these days.

402
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:54,741
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

403
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:55,974
How do you know?

404
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,089
I don't know, but I believe.

405
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:03,906
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, damn it, so can I.

406
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,850
You're losing me.

407
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,206
The point is, something good's going to happen to me.

408
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:13,211
Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

409
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,860
So I should keep looking?

410
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:18,807
Of course you should.

411
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:22,925
And now, you're going to do it for free.

1
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:16,154
So Kids, there are many buildings in New York City.

2
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,101
Thousands of apartments,

3
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,166
millions of stories.

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:23,777
And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now,

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,099
there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment.

6
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:32,006
I have so many great memories of that place.

7
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,113
Marshall playing video games.

8
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:37,167
Lily painting on the fire escape.

9
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:39,121
Hey!

10
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,484
Sorry, Mr. Matson.

11
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,447
And me making the coffee.

12
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,999
I had this coffee pot-- it was probably 50 years old at the time,

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,007
and it made truly terrible coffee.

14
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,915
We called it Shocky.

15
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:53,366
Plugging in.

16
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:54,804
Saving game.

17
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,538
I loved every last detail of that place,

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,870
right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall.

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,143
I never wanted any of it to change.

20
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,534
But that's not how life works.

21
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,073
You guys will never believe what just happened to us.

22
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,662
I don't even believe it myself.

23
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:19,079
We were in Queens, and we decided to stop by my apartment.

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,679
Wait, her apartment?

25
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,169
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.

26
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:27,129
I could see how you would think that, but I have to have my own place.

27
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,794
It's an independence thing.

28
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,533
When was the last time you were there?

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,199
Three months ago.

30
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,686
What?

31
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,287
It's like fat pants.

32
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,789
You hope you never have to use them, but you're glad to know they're there.

33
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,632
What the hell?

34
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:43,601
What?

35
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,123
This is my apartment.

36
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,591
Where?

37
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,082
Right here.

38
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,747
What the hell?

39
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,973
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

40
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:58,469
No, no, this was my apartment.

41
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,874
My dresser was right...

42
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,003
That's my dresser!

43
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,389
And this is my closet.

44
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:10,259
And I spilled nail polish there. There's the stain.

45
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,970
Hi. How many?

46
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,444
Lily.

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,194
Yes. You know me?

48
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,964
Yeah. From your homecoming picture.

49
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,433
You're much prettier in person.

50
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,862
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

51
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,483
Where's my stuff?!

52
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,218
Oh, it's all in the back.

53
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,721
We could wrap it up for you.

54
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,338
You want it to go?

55
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,752
This is my apartment.

56
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:34,865
Not anymore.

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,679
No way. You're making this up.

58
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:40,032
Yeah, the building would have had to give you some kind of notice.

59
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,802
They sent you a notice about this.

60
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,624
When?

61
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:44,269
Three months ago.

62
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,387
And here's your mail.

63
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,765
Minus magazines.

64
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:51,050
Well, still legally, they can't just toss you out on the street.

65
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,074
You have a lease.

66
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,068
Okay, so I didn't have a written lease as such,

67
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,579
but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

68
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,271
She may be 98 years old, but she's still...

69
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,053
She's dead, isn't she?

70
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,992
Never even saw the bus.

71
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:10,991
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

72
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,798
What am I going to do?

73
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,547
Come live with us.

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,567
Really?

75
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,641
Of course.

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,900
You sure about this, Ted?

77
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,823
Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway.

78
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,451
It's not like it'll change anything.

79
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,938
No, it's like it will change everything.

80
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,115
Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.

81
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:28,660
What are you talking about?

82
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,372
And why is that girl checking you out?

83
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,128
Because I look good.

84
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,155
Now, focus.

85
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,847
You and Marshall are roommates.

86
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,136
You have an amazing apartment.

87
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,110
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

88
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,046
Yeah, so?

89
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,421
So, you're not still going to be his roommate when he gets married, are you?

90
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,668
Someone's going to move out. So who's it going to be?

91
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,372
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment.

92
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,227
You've talked about who gets the apartment, right?

93
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,949
Yeah, we've talked about it.

94
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:59,283
So when Lily and I get married, who's going to get the apartment?

95
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,555
Oh, that's a tough one.

96
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,604
You know who I think could handle a problem like that?

97
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:05,997
Who?

98
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:09,254
Future Ted and Future Marshall.

99
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,729
Totally.

100
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,623
Let's let those guys handle it.

101
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,409
Damn it, Past Ted.

102
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,296
You blew it, dude.

103
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:20,450
Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic.

104
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,525
They're edging you out.

105
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:23,558
That's crazy. They're not edging me out.

106
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,211
Marshall's my best friend.

107
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,116
One of my best friends.

108
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,153
He wouldn't do that to me.

109
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,051
Just keep your eyes open, that's all I'm saying, Teddy.

110
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,985
Little things are going to be changing around that apartment.

111
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,868
Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid.

112
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,961
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

113
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,242
I'm sort of on a date with her.

114
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:43,969
What?

115
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,089
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,168
I found her online.

117
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:51,041
I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups.

118
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,299
I'm looking for a soul mate.

119
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,881
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

120
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,899
Or so it says in my profile.

121
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,039
But this girl...

122
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,471
she wants the same stuff. And it's... it's bumming me out.

123
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:09,292
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

124
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:09,929
All right.

125
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:10,993
You're going to the hospital?

126
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,968
No. See, he's going to go back over there, and I'm going to call him.

127
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:16,112
He's going to pretend it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.

128
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,395
Oh, Lord, fake emergency?

129
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,925
That is the lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book.

130
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,321
I expect more from you, Barney.

131
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,955
Well, stay tuned. I'm working on some stuff.

132
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,212
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

133
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,736
So, are you going to talk to Marshall?

134
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,325
He's going to want the apartment, I'm going to want the apartment.

135
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,778
It's going to lead to an argument. So, no.

136
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,827
Hmm, that's real healthy.

137
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:44,345
So when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it?

138
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,385
I should really make this call.

139
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,861
Ooh, can I do it?

140
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,666
Excuse me.

141
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,240
Hello.

142
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,379
Hi, there... sexy.

143
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:02,261
Hello, Aunt Cathy. What's up?

144
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,717
Oh, nothing.

145
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:07,627
Just sitting here thinking about you, hot stuff.

146
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,596
An accident?

147
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:12,737
Well, is Uncle Rudy going to be okay?

148
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:17,884
Aunt Cathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.

149
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:20,551
Oh, God!

150
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,890
Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?

151
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,847
Oh, come on, Daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.

152
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,766
Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,347
I'll be right there.

154
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,744
You know... I...

155
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:41,700
See you guys later.

156
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,993
Put it on my check.

157
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,919
Ah, this will be nice.

158
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,422
The three of us living together.

159
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,733
I think it's a good setup.

160
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,888
Man, this coffee's great.

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,395
It's really great.

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,045
Too great.

163
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,416
What happened to Shocky?

164
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,109
What's this?

165
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,140
My coffeemaker from my apartment.

166
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,867
It makes great coffee, right?

167
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:20,674
Yeah, definitely.

168
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,666
I mean, so does Shocky.

169
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:23,789
Really?

170
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:27,058
I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kind of rusty.

171
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,657
Yeah, no, it did.

172
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:32,066
I mean, I kind of liked the rusty taste.

173
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm used to it, I don't know.

174
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:39,196
Also, Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock people.

175
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:44,633
No, it's just... you got to admit that shock, that... wakes you up in the morning.

176
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,205
You know what else wakes you up in the morning?

177
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:48,373
Coffee.

178
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,147
That's great. You're right.

179
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:54,267
Roomies.

180
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,136
I love it.

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,491
They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out.

182
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:01,918
I didn't believe it, but you're right.

183
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,081
Told you. That Lily-- she's a shrewd one.

184
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:08,983
Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker-- how dare she.

185
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:11,143
It's not just the coffeemaker.

186
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,245
Done.

187
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,725
The painting's done.

188
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,155
- That is great.
- Nice.

189
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,175
Where do you want to hang it?

190
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,422
I don't know.

191
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:23,359
Uh... Over the piano?

192
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,746
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

193
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:31,169
Too bad the swords are there. 
We kind of love those swords.

194
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,811
Well, those swords have been up there a long time.

195
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,395
I know, right? I'd really miss them, too.

196
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:40,211
So, maybe Marshall's room.

197
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,373
Okay.

198
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,604
He was going to take the swords down.

199
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,737
Can you believe that?

200
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:49,732
Ted, why don't you just talk to him. He's your best friend.

201
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,084
One of your best friends.

202
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,016
The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.

203
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:01,418
Healthy communication? 
That's the worst idea ever.

204
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:04,115
Look, you held off their first advance. That's good.

205
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:06,402
Now it's time to counterstrike.

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,922
Well, what am I supposed to do?

207
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,843
You got to mark your territory. 
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

208
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,476
You've got to do something big.

209
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,385
What, like buy a new sofa?

210
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:17,847
Bigger.

211
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:19,768
Katie's here.

212
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,058
Okay, real quick... last night, epiphany--

213
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,644
I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready?

214
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,257
A lemon law.

215
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,315
A lemon law like for cars?

216
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,662
Exactly.

217
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,136
From the moment the date begins, you have five minutes

218
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,658
to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening.

219
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,774
And if you don't, it's no hard feelings. Just,

220
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:39,321
"Good night. Thanks for playing. See you never."

221
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,761
Huh? Huh? The lemon law-- it's going to be a thing.

222
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,464
Possibly, starting right now.

223
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,483
Hi, Katie. Barney.

224
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,886
Hi. It's good to finally meet you.

225
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,206
Hmm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.

226
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,493
Tell your friends.

227
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,379
It's going to be a thing.

228
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,104
Man, Ted's been acting weird.

229
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,340
He started labeling all his food.

230
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,151
He even carved "Ted" into that block of cheese.

231
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,362
Yeah.

232
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,097
Well, now it's Ed's.

233
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,579
I think he's not cool with me moving in.

234
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,377
No, that's not it.

235
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,446
You've basically lived here all along.

236
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:32,740
Ted loves you.

237
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,973
So what's he PMSing about?

238
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,679
I don't know.

239
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:39,951
But when he's ready to talk to me about it, he'll come and talk to me about it.

240
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,375
Are you kidding?

241
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,590
You guys never talk about anything.

242
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,781
He'll just let it fester under the surface

243
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,596
until he doesn't something big and passive-aggressive.

244
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,259
You clearly don't know Ted.

245
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,275
Delivery for Ted Mosby.

246
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,257
Your English phone booth arrived.

247
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh, awesome! It's great, right?

248
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,556
Yeah, I guess.

249
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,018
I'm just not sure if Lily's going to like it.

250
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:16,424
Well, I like it, so I'm just going to keep it right here, if that's cool.

251
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,485
Of course.

252
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,411
I mean, we all live here, so...

253
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,791
we should all be able to have things the way we want them.

254
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:23,945
Exactly.

255
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:24,968
Great.

256
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,228
Terrific.

257
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,158
You like the phone booth, it stays.

258
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,269
I like this painting...

259
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,014
so I'm just going to hang it...

260
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,297
right here on the wall.

261
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,128
Oh. So it's like that, is it?

262
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:51,840
Oh, hello, governor. Oh, it's like that, isn't it? Cheerio.

263
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,661
Yeah, it's like that.

264
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,919
- I want this apartment.
- Well, I want it, too.

265
00:11:58,702 --> 00:11:59,944
You're a jerk.

266
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,797
No, I'm a visionary.

267
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,768
Lemon law! It's going to be a thing.

268
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:10,098
For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything

269
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,810
that's wrong with our no-attention-span society.

270
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,127
No. Wrong. Lemon law's awesome.

271
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,052
It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone.

272
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:22,749
You keep giving up on people so quickly. You could miss out on something great.

273
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,347
Okay, you're on a blind date.

274
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:28,472
Sitting across from the table is... that guy.

275
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,487
You really think it'll take more than five minutes

276
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,874
to realize there will be no date number two?

277
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,563
Yes, I do.

278
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,183
For all I know, that guy's my soul mate.

279
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,609
Oh... bad move, Scherbotsky.

280
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,504
Hi.

281
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,680
Have you met Robin?

282
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

283
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:55,903
All right, Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment.

284
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,033
May lead to an argument,

285
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,048
but we're settling this.

286
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,273
Or we could flip a coin.

287
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:02,703
Yeah, let's flip a coin.

288
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,178
- Flip it.
- Okay.

289
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,445
I'm flipping it. Here I go.

290
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,058
- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go.

291
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,266
- Flip it.
- I'm flipping.

292
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,852
But before I do, I just want to say something.

293
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,563
You didn't even want to move in here in the first place.

294
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,492
You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.

295
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:19,501
That was five years ago.

296
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,747
Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter.

297
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,706
Oh, snap. What else you got?

298
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,055
Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

299
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,328
- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall.

300
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,397
- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.

301
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:36,273
Oh, no, you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're still in law school.

302
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:37,476
It's going to be at least three years.

303
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,922
It could be sooner. We're not that careful with our birth control.

304
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,097
Two-zip.

305
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,542
Oh, come on! You know damn well, I move out, that room's going unused.

306
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,604
Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate. Who's it going to be, Barney?

307
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,189
You know he cooks naked.

308
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,975
Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.

309
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,442
We were bros!

310
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,586
These swords represent our bro-hood.

311
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,228
And you took them down to make room for your fiancee's stupid painting?

312
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,771
My fiancee? Suddenly she's "my fiancee"?

313
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,318
Lily's a part of who I am.

314
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,046
And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are, too.

315
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,949
She's a bro by extension.

316
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,542
I deserve this apartment, Marshall.

317
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,501
No more than I do.

318
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:15,609
Great.

319
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,073
So let's flip for it.

320
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,590
Flip it.

321
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,409
Si this is how we're deciding who gets the apartment?

322
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,670
I guess so.

323
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,141
How are we doing this exactly?

324
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,593
Is this, like, to the death?

325
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,081
We should probably figure that out.

326
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,568
Ooh! Ow. Ow.

327
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,320
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.

328
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:38,797
Can I observe something?

329
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,246
That this is kind of awesome?

330
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,133
Totally.

331
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,437
- I can't believe we didn't do this before.
- I know.

332
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,317
Thank you.

333
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:51,532
I can't believe this.

334
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:55,933
I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant.

335
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,407
Sweet.

336
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,867
It's a nice place.

337
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,055
It's good to know the future has ribs.

338
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:06,063
In the future, food will most likely be served in gel cap form.

339
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,239
Plus, cows will probably have died out by then.

340
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,083
Or be our leaders.

341
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,303
Hello.

342
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,859
H-H-H-H-Hey. Time's running out, Scherbotsky.

343
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,278
Last chance for the lemon law.

344
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,394
Leave me alone.

345
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:25,323
4:56, 4:57, 4:58...

346
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,269
We're only just getting to know each other.

347
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:29,339
Say I'm right and this could all be over.

348
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,599
This could be your call from the hospital.

349
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:32,998
Sorry.

350
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:37,898
Let me guess-- there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.

351
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:39,988
No, I would never do that.

352
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,563
I don't want to go anywhere.

353
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,883
I'm all yours.

354
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:47,647
Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money...

355
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:52,768
- Oh, that was awesome.
- I know.

356
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:53,967
Do it again.

357
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:56,855
Okay. But this time jump up and I'll swipe your legs.

358
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,944
Look... here's why I should get the place.

359
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,354
You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right?

360
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:14,855
I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates.

361
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,592
And on top of that, I have to be homeless. Does that seem fair?

362
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,504
Oh, boo-freakin'-hoo.

363
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,555
What?!

364
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:25,153
Woe is me. "I'm not married yet. my ovaries are shrinking." Ted!

365
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,809
If you wanted to be married by now, you would be, but you're not.

366
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:28,886
And you know why?

367
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,617
Because you're irrationally picky.

368
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,746
You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.

369
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,335
- "Anhedonic"?
- Anhedonic.

370
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,047
It means you can't enjoy anything.

371
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,167
The hell I can't.

372
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,730
- I'm enjoying this.
- I know. This rules!

373
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,746
Hey. I'm sorry I took those swords down.

374
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,831
Dude, that's okay. It lead to this totally rad swordfight, didn't it?

375
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,812
Yeah, it did.

376
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,841
You remeer when we first got these swords?

377
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:59,494
It was the day we moved in.

378
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,235
Congratulations, Marshall, we live in an apartment with swords on the wall.

379
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:06,360
List of lifelong dreams, you're now half as long.

380
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,271
Crap, I'm missing one of the screws for this table.

381
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,565
Just use this wood glue. It'll hold.

382
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah.

383
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:22,354
Oh god, I'll be right there. 
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

384
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,876
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

385
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,180
Hab Slosi' Quch!

386
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,678
It's a Klingon insult. You have no honor.

387
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:34,753
You know, if you felt this way, you could've just been upfront.

388
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,520
No, I swear, that was a real call. I just...

389
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,143
Oh, forget it.

390
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,452
I stabbed Lily.

391
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,821
I stabbed my fiancee.

392
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:52,615
Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancee?

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,191
I'm kidding.

394
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,167
Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment.

395
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:02,176
But you fought so bravely for it.

396
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:05,798
I wasn't fighting for the apartment, I was fighting for...

397
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,886
I don't know... for everything to stay the way it is.

398
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,478
But I'm not going to get that, so...

399
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:15,250
seriously, take the place, it's yours.

400
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:16,785
Is she okay?

401
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,518
They're just patching her up. She's going to be fine.

402
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,976
So get this: I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...

403
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,524
What? You said she's fine.

404
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,719
So anyway, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...

405
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,172
Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression.

406
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,110
I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie... oh.

407
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,676
Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to lemon law you.

408
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,749
It's out there. It's a thing.

409
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,667
The lemon law is a thing!

410
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,771
Damn, I should've called it Barney's law.

411
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:51,543
- But you totally...
- Just let him have this one.

412
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,624
All set.

413
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,133
She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed roundtable?

414
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:01,914
That's us.

415
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,356
A swordfight?

416
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,285
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

417
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,718
On Monday, I'm going to have to tell my kindergarten class,

418
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,202
who I teach not to run with scissors,

419
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:18,562
that my fiance ran me through with a frickin' broadsword.

420
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:22,892
Well just to be fair, 
it didn't go all the way through.

421
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:28,472
I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?

422
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,347
You're right.

423
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,993
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:36,047
We were fighting to see who gets the apartment, and I won.

425
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,653
Uh, you didn't win.

426
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,886
I... gave it to you.

427
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,395
Wait, wait, wait. 
I don't want that apartment.

428
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,916
It's a boy apartment. It's...

429
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:49,175
full of swords and video games and...

430
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,600
kind of smells like dude.

431
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:57,336
I mean, it's fine for now, 
but when we get married,

432
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,183
I want to start a new life with you...

433
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:02,150
in a new place.

434
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,853
Gonna miss the old place.

435
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,631
I will, too.

436
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,471
But we're not going to get married for, like, a year.

437
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,657
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

438
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,247
Let that guy deal with it.

439
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,635
Totally.

440
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:20,079
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking, but I'm starving.

441
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,163
Let's go get some dinner.

442
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,305
I know just the place.

443
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,842
Chinese restaurant. I still don't believe it.

444
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,291
I told you.

445
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,214
Hey, a toast.

446
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,685
Life is full of changes.

447
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:38,091
One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings.

448
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,347
But the important stuff doesn't change.

449
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,667
To the important stuff.

450
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,179
Here, here.

451
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,496
- Cheers. 
- Cheers.

452
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,108
And to the lemon law.

453
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,013
Self click.

454
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,333
And by the way, I bought these glasses.

455
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,175
Bought them at Ikea.

456
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,849
These are my glasses!

457
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,166
I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.

458
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,750
And I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape you made me in sophomore year.

459
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,210
Yeah, right.

460
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,445
Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.

461
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,076
I love you, Lily.

462
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,409
Happy Valentine's Day 1997.

1
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,071
Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story.

2
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:19,075
Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time.

3
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,130
It's a time for giving of yourself,

4
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,034
for thinking of your fellow man.

5
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:27,674
A time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.

6
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,078
Well, I just ralphed.

7
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:32,276
How much did you guys drink last night?

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,436
Not how much...

9
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:34,374
what?

10
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,089
The Thankstini.

11
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:39,385
A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented.

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:43,524
Cranberry juice, potato vodka, and a bouillon cube.

13
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,368
Tastes just like a turkey dinner.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,249
Mmm, it's like Thanksgiving in my mouth!

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,871
You want a good holiday drink, 
try his Kwanzaapolitan.

16
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,027
The shuttle's here!

17
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:01,119
He hasn't been back home 
to Minnesota since Christmas.

18
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,367
He's a little excited.

19
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:04,441
Lily, we're holding up the shuttle. Do you have everything you need--

20
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,536
toothbrush, pajamas, underpants?

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,790
Underpants!

22
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,344
So, Lil...

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,220
Marshall's family.

24
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:16,184
A whole weekend with the future in-laws. You excited?

25
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:18,298
Yeah, no, it'll be fun.

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,698
Lily, you just said, "Yeah, no."

27
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:22,437
Did I?

28
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:24,943
No. I-I love Marshall's family.

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,130
But yeah, no, it'll be great.

30
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:28,219
You just did it again.

31
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:29,648
Yeah, no, shut up.

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,952
So you're not going home for Thanksgiving?

33
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,860
No, I have to work on Friday. You?

34
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,696
I'm Canadian, remember? 
We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.

35
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,133
Oh, right, I forgot. 
You guys are weird.

36
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,601
You pronounce the word "out," "oat."

37
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:46,853
You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt,

38
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:50,871
and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.

39
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:54,796
Your cops are called "Mounties."

40
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,796
So probably hanging out with Barney, then?

41
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:01,229
No. Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.

42
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,714
Thanksgiving in a strip club. Who's in?

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,243
The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet.

44
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:08,432
Plus they do this thing:

45
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,162
Heather dresses up as a pilgrim,

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,171
and Misty dresses up as an Indian,

47
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,581
and they share a meal together.

48
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,477
Oh, Barney.

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,504
I'm sorry... Native American.

50
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:23,528
I think I'm going to a homeless shelter, serve food.

51
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,641
That's awesome!

52
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:28,560
Yeah, I though I'd just spend the day giving back, you know? Doing some good.

53
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:29,823
Canceling out Barney.

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,928
Exactly.

55
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,478
Where are all my underpants!

56
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,665
Did you check your suitcase?

57
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,109
Let's go!

58
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,096
And go they went...

59
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,311
all the way to St. Cloud, 
Minnesota, Marshall's hometown.

60
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,913
And as Lily stepped into her fianc�'s boyhood home,

61
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,602
she received a big welcome.

62
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,542
Hello, we're home!

63
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,692
Hello... hey...

64
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:53,831
A very big welcome.

65
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:58,133
You see, at six-foot-four, Marshall 
was the runt of the Eriksen clan.

66
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,072
Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.

67
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:06,107
Where's my almost daughter-in-law?

68
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:07,233
Here I am!

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,092
Oh, you got yourself 
a great little bride here, son.

70
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,431
All right, now.

71
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,934
No fartin' around!

72
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,286
Put your skates and your pads on, boys! 
Game on in five minutes!

73
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,418
Yeah, all right.

74
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,885
Oh, you're gonna play hockey?

75
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,392
With a basketball?

76
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,310
Well, it's sort of a combination of the two.

77
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:27,930
We call it bask-ice-ball.

78
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,212
We invented it.

79
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,816
It's the most dangerous 
and awesome sport in the world.

80
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,611
Bask-ice-ball?

81
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,589
Not ice-ketball?

82
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,960
Ice-ketball?

83
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,722
That just sounds weird.

84
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,745
It's bask-ice-ball, okay?

85
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:43,975
And I'm the best.

86
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,169
You wish.

87
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,794
Well, maybe that's just 
'cause you haven't seen me play.

88
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,541
Oh... I don't know, honey.

89
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,164
It's not really a sport for a girl.

90
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:56,217
Well, that's funny, because 
your brother throws like a girl.

91
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,099
Marcus!

92
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,621
This is going to be great.

93
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,945
I know. I'm so psyched we did this.

94
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,847
Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man.

95
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,775
These have got to be 
the best people in New York.

96
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,810
...to Grandmother's house... 
'Scuse me, guys. Coming through.

97
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:15,899
Barney?

98
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,598
Well, hi guys.

99
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:19,046
What are you doing here?

100
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,201
Oh, just the Lord's work.

101
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,623
But you're Satan.

102
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,638
Guys, okay, look. I don't 
advertise it, but I volunteer here.

103
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:30,344
I think it's important 
to help the less fortunate.

104
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,295
I'm the Angelina Jolie 
of incredibly hot guys.

105
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,757
This is a joke, right?

106
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,129
You don't actually volunteer here.

107
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:40,307
Barney, we need you out front. 
There's a logjam on the stuffing line.

108
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,213
Can you show them how it's done?

109
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,248
I'm on it.

110
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,674
Wait, so this is real? 
Barney does this?

111
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,290
Every Sunday, all year long.

112
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:47,488
He's our best volunteer.

113
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,067
That's 'cause I was trained by the best, Kendall.

114
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,530
Anyway, we're psyched to be here, Kendall.

115
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,474
What do you need us to do?

116
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,769
Uh, go home. We're full.

117
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:56,608
What?

118
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,573
We're volunteers. We're unpaid help.

119
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,625
Can you ever really have enough unpaid help?

120
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:02,903
On the biggest volunteer day of the year?

121
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,510
Yeah, you can.

122
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,982
Come on, we just want to help out.

123
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:07,960
Kendall, they're cool.

124
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,240
Fine, but I'm not promising anything.

125
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:13,601
Wait here-- we'll let you know if we need you.

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,212
Okay, well, I'd better get back out there. There's a lot of food to give out.

127
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,914
And a lot of smiles.

128
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,667
Oh, I almost forgot.

129
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:32,050
I know it's early, but... 
you are a future Mrs. Eriksen.

130
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,449
Thank you!

131
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:38,647
Well, it'll go great with my, uh... 
I just love it.

132
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,167
Okay, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.

133
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:48,385
Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander-lime vinaigrette.

134
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,355
But this is an American holiday.

135
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:56,075
Lily, now that you're going to be a Mrs. Eriksen,

136
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,860
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:

137
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:03,955
the Eriksen family seven-layer salad.

138
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,809
Seven-layer salad?

139
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:11,916
"Six cups of mayonnaise"? 
That can't be right.

140
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,974
Oh, no, dear. 16 cups.

141
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,309
Mayo's in that cabinet.

142
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,598
Oh, my God.

143
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:23,499
There is some serious 
bask-ice-ball going on out there.

144
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,806
Dad totally nailed Marcus 
in the face with a snowball,

145
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,323
which is a foul, 'cause you only get 
one snowball per possession,

146
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:31,786
so I nailed him in the shin 
with my skate and I totally dunked it!

147
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:34,833
Yeah, you were sittin' pretty 
till I whacked you with that mallet.

148
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,940
Hey, gorgeous.

149
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,177
You having fun?

150
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,804
Yeah, but... but I kind of miss you.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,693
Could you stay in here for a little bit?

152
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. It's halftime.

153
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:47,795
Oh, halftime's over! 
Get your butts out here! Come on.

154
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,211
And I hope you like 
the taste of skate, dorko!

155
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:53,730
Go.

156
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,594
Thanks, baby.

157
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:58,107
Aw, isn't this great?

158
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:01,193
Can't you see why everyone from 
my high school stays in this town?

159
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:05,061
Hey, Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko.

160
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,357
Man, it's amazing out there.

161
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,697
I've done so much good today, 
I've got like a soul boner.

162
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:19,503
Man, he way the faces 
of the less fortunate light up

163
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:23,033
when you give them a hot, nutritious meal. Is there a better feeling on Earth?

164
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:26,723
Yesterday you said the best feeling on Earth was getting your toes sucked.

165
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,285
Then you requested a high-five with your foot.

166
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:35,700
Hey, Barn, what do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?

167
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,027
You want to scoop stuffing your first day out?

168
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,758
Hello? NFL? 
Can I be quarterback this Sunday?

169
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,521
Dude.

170
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:49,054
Okay, I finished the gummi bear layer of the... salad.

171
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,141
What's next?

172
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,299
Potato chips. Of course.

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,113
So, Lily... when are you gonna start 
thinking about having a baby?

174
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:58,685
Baby?

175
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:02,187
Uh, you know, 
I hadn't really thought about it.

176
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,242
At all.

177
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,097
Actually, Aunt Lily was lying.

178
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,812
It was all she'd been thinking about.

179
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,600
You see, remember when she said...

180
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,936
Well, I just ralphed...

181
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,691
At that point, she was five days late.

182
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,434
This was day six.

183
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:19,444
Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?

184
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:20,944
Oh, are you kidding?

185
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,900
I was younger than you when I had Marcus.

186
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:25,579
Beautiful 15-pound boy.

187
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,485
Not much bigger than this turkey right here.

188
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,213
Oh, my.

189
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:41,222
Now, if Lily was already uneasy 
about joining the Eriksen family,

190
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:46,568
imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen growing inside of her.

191
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,490
That's a big baby, Judy.

192
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,407
The doctor thought he was twins.

193
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,926
Twins!

194
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,523
Twins!

195
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,862
This is crazy! When did it get 
so hard to do charity work?

196
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,661
I do charity work all the time.

197
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,549
Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend?

198
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,305
Delightful.

199
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:09,166
How's that little project coming along anyway?

200
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,213
I'm working on it.

201
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,012
I'm gonna introduce you 
to that girl you've been staring at.

202
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,076
What? That's crazy, 
I haven't been staring at any girl...

203
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,437
Have you met Ted?

204
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:19,298
Hi. I'm the afore mentioned Ted.

205
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,452
And this is... um, gone.

206
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:22,801
I'm Amanda.

207
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,533
Hi.

208
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:25,285
So, uh, what do you do here, Ted?

209
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,642
Well, I've been... um, nothing. 
I do nothing.

210
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,936
Well, if you want to do something,

211
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,247
you and your girlfriend 
can help sort through these donations.

212
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:35,488
Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend.

213
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:40,448
I used to be, but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted emotionally

214
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,228
or sexually.

215
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:43,858
Oh, my God.

216
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,442
So, Amanda...

217
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,603
What do you need us to do?

218
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,023
Okay, this is important.

219
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,044
Go through all these boxes of food donations,

220
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,628
take out the really good stuff, 
and put it into this box.

221
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,445
Got it.

222
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:56,928
Consider it sorted.

223
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,160
Hey, we're in business.

224
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,653
Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.

225
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:07,189
Let's start with this one.

226
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,142
Yeah.

227
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,181
Amen.

228
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,623
Amen.

229
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,455
Look who came to say good night.

230
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,870
It's little Martin.

231
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,655
Three months old.

232
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,009
Months?

233
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,319
Three months.

234
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:21,891
He's been drinking his milk.

235
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,310
And she's already pregnant again?

236
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:31,538
Well, that's 'cause 
those Eriksen boys' boys can swim.

237
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,321
They've got two tails 
and a drill bit for a head.

238
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,287
Dad, you're embarrassing me!

239
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:39,663
Oh, don't worry about it, son, she's cool.

240
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,491
She's going to be an Eriksen.

241
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:46,088
Yeah. well, well, not literally, 'cause, you know, I'm keeping my name.

242
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,597
But... the apron.

243
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:54,770
Well, we haven't actually 
decided anything yet, so we're...

244
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:58,425
No, I've decided 
and I'm keeping my own name.

245
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,930
But Eriksen is a great last name.

246
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,438
People know the Eriksens.

247
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:11,324
Well, sure, in St. Cloud, but our kids aren't going to be growing up in St. Cloud.

248
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,787
Right, baby?

249
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,246
Well, why not St. Cloud?

250
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,941
I mean, I loved growing up in St. Cloud.

251
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,520
St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.

252
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:23,535
Well, so is New York.

253
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,764
What? It is. And we grew up just fine.

254
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,080
And we grew to the proper size 
and then we stopped.

255
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,050
Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?

256
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:41,051
Oh, that's for me.

257
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:42,443
You can put it in my car.

258
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,692
In your car, um, 
and then you'll take it...?

259
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,295
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra food, 
no one can eat it all.

260
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:53,119
Ooh, truffle oil. Score!

261
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,062
People donated this food thinking 
it was going to feed the hungry.

262
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,053
I know.

263
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:00,024
And I'm starving.

264
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,505
But, Marshall, you love New York.

265
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,290
Yes, I do,

266
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,634
but you always said that when we have kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.

267
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:12,382
Yeah, to Brooklyn.

268
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:17,566
Why are we even talking about this? This is like way down the road.

269
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:22,013
But Lily knew "way down the road" might not be so far down the road.

270
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,033
I need to go to the restroom.

271
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,876
Lily, the restroom's the other way.

272
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:29,225
So she literally headed down the road.

273
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,641
Lily?!

274
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,767
Lily!

275
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,156
So wait, not only have you not done 
any good for anyone today,

276
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:42,081
you're actually helping 
someone steal from the homeless?

277
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:46,405
You know, Ted, it's called 
Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking Damn.

278
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,441
Barney, you needed me 
to sign your time sheet, right?

279
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,914
Oh, yeah, right. Thanks.

280
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,111
Barney.

281
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:54,375
Yeah, what's up?

282
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,908
You have a time sheet?

283
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,549
No one else has a time sheet.

284
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:58,505
Yeah. So?

285
00:12:58,597 --> 00:12:59,371
All right, let me see that.

286
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,681
That's my private, personal business!

287
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,502
Court-mandated community service?

288
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,690
Oh my God, you're on probation?

289
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:08,178
What did you do?

290
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,159
That's my private, personal business.

291
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:22,530
I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.

292
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,742
You peed on a church?

293
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,522
I peed in an alley, 
which happened to have a church,

294
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:30,344
which I did not see because I was drunk.

295
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,187
Oh, you are evil.

296
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,791
Ah, all's right with the world again.

297
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:38,483
Okay, fine, so a judge is making me do this.

298
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,099
But I'm still doing it.

299
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,438
And kicking ass at it, BTW.

300
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,764
When's the last time 
either of you did something good, huh?

301
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,756
Kendall. Ah, Kendall.

302
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:57,228
Amanda is stealing portabello 
mushrooms from homeless people.

303
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,717
Amanda.

304
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,710
I called dibs on the portabello mushrooms.

305
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:04,903
Those are for the hungry.

306
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:05,978
I know.

307
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,698
And I'm starving.

308
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:15,175
Those are good mushrooms.

309
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:16,575
Mushrooms. Mushrooms.

310
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,040
Portabello mushrooms for everyone.

311
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,933
Take them and run!

312
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:21,527
They're very expensive.

313
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,799
Happy Thanksgiving.

314
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,798
"Happy Thanksgiving." Huh.

315
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:32,456
As in "check out the chick 
buying the knockup test, everybody.

316
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,438
Wonder what must be going through her head?

317
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:38,586
Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants

318
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,609
is trying to suck me 
into their suburban nightmare,

319
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,078
and there's a solid chance 
that I have an Eriksen

320
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:48,332
the size of a 15-pound turkey 
growing inside of me!

321
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,011
Oh, you know the Eriksens?

322
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,704
You're Marshall's fianc�e.

323
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:54,659
Fantastic.

324
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,106
So nice to meet you.

325
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,111
You are taller than described.

326
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,408
Look, I'm sorry I just yelled at you.

327
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,350
You mind if I use your bathroom?

328
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,723
Don't have one.

329
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,064
What do you do when you have to...?

330
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:08,285
I hold it.

331
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,769
You can't fire a volunteer.

332
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,345
Apparently you can.

333
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:22,463
And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.

334
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,924
I can't believe I told Kendall 
you guys were cool.

335
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,577
I have 40 hours left 
on my community service

336
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:32,744
and now I've gotta spend it spearing trash on a freakin' median strip.

337
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,955
Volunteer of the year!

338
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,192
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

339
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:44,025
Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you just tell me. I'll-I'll do it.

340
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,125
Ted, I'm glad you asked.

341
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,223
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #

342
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,455
# Domo... domo #

343
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,873
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #

344
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,738
Surprisingly good.

345
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,619
Right? I told you so.

346
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:01,341
Public urination. 
Who gets arrested for public urination?

347
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,239
Lily's been arrested.

348
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,260
Oh, dear. What for?

349
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,100
Public urination.

350
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,110
Thanks, Pete.

351
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,379
No problemo, Marsh.

352
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,683
You all right?

353
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:21,925
No.

354
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,887
I embarrassed myself in front of your family,

355
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:29,391
and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.

356
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:32,509
# Domo arrigato, Mr. Roboto #

357
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,678
Well, I'm glad that you're safe.

358
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,898
Hey, weird question.

359
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:41,265
Why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?

360
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,348
Okay, I'll tell you, but before I do,

361
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:47,037
promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota. Promise.

362
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,256
I'm not suggesting that 
we move here tomorrow, I'm just...

363
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:50,473
Promise.

364
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,049
Why do you want me to promise you that?

365
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:53,818
Because. I don't fit in here.

366
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:58,828
I'm not eight feet tall, and I don't think you could call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.

367
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,889
I'm Funyuns.

368
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,013
And mayonnaise and gummi bears

369
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,655
and bask-ice-ball, and I love St. Cloud.

370
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:08,486
And, yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday,

371
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:13,007
and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?

372
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,791
Okay, personal effects.

373
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,324
One wallet. One cell phone.

374
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,414
One... pregnancy test.

375
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,950
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.

376
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:39,814
Whoa.

377
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,373
Yeah.

378
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:45,294
Lily, we can't let our kids play bask-ice-ball.

379
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,775
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.

380
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,278
Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway?

381
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:54,176
There are no rules. 
We just wail on each other.

382
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:02,322
Look, I don't want to be 
exactly like my family.

383
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,540
And don't take this the wrong way,

384
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:09,899
but I don't want to be exactly 
like your family either.

385
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:13,460
We'll be our own family.

386
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,378
And we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home.

387
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:23,673
Great, now I'm crying.

388
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:25,145
Look.

389
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,932
We may have some really big decisions to make in about ten seconds.

390
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:33,048
But right now, I don't care 
where our kids grow up.

391
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,622
As long as they have you for a father.

392
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,507
Gosh, I hope you're the father.

393
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,881
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.

394
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,142
What does it say?

395
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,789
I'm afraid to look.

396
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,536
It's negative!

397
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,370
Oh, thank God.

398
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,699
Oh, thank God.

399
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,227
And, hey!

400
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,725
Ted. Are you listening?

401
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,788
You're a good guy.

402
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,013
Want to know why I have to work tomorrow?

403
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,390
My firm's designing an executive 
lounge for a tobacco company.

404
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:18,135
In the fight against cancer, 
I'm on the side of cancer.

405
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,245
Okay, Ted, I found a way 
for you to help someone.

406
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,222
To do some good.

407
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,359
This is Walter.

408
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:23,798
Walter is homeless.

409
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,851
And Walter would like a lap dance.

410
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:27,643
Are you joking?

411
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:31,775
I never joke about the sublime 
art of burlesque entertainment.

412
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,311
No, Barney, that's insane.

413
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,185
Sir, would you like me 
to buy you a ticket to the buffet?

414
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,014
No, I'm stuffed. 
Just a lap dance will be fine.

415
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,759
Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners.

416
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:44,967
You know where he hasn't been?

417
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,408
To heaven with Samantha.

418
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:52,517
Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need.

419
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:54,800
Now, buy this man a lap dance.

420
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,589
You said you wanted to see 
the look of joy in someone's eyes.

421
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,509
You know, I don't think I'm going to watch.

422
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,152
Here you go, Walter.

423
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,765
Happy Thanksgiving.

424
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,152
Thank you so much.

425
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,314
No, really. Thank you.

426
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:17,538
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

427
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,329
Thanksgiving in November.

428
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:23,489
Weird.

429
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,727
So that was Thanksgiving 2005.

430
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:34,764
To be honest, it didn't go great.

431
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:36,880
The life has plenty of good parts.

432
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,731
It's the rough parts that make you thankfull that you have people to share it with.

433
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,818
Hey, I saw what you did 
for that guy. It was really sweet.

434
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,846
Do you want a dance?

435
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,174
Uh, no, thanks.

436
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:08,954
Do you want some yams?

437
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:10,451
No, thanks.

438
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,639
I'm Amber.

439
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,101
I'm Ted.

440
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,222
Actually... I'm Tracy.

441
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,667
Still Ted.

442
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,289
And that, kids, is the true story 
of how I met your mother.

443
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,355
- What?!
- What?!

444
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:25,400
I'm kidding.

Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,590
But there's one story I don't remember.

3
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:10,197
Uncle Marshall still refers to it as "The Pineapple Incident."

4
00:00:10,622 --> 00:00:12,484
The night started like any other.

5
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,131
We were downstairs at the bar.

6
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,408
On the house.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,934
It's my own concoction.

8
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:19,440
I call it the Red Dragon.

9
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,175
- Wow! Thanks!
- That was really sweet.

10
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,594
- We're not really doing shotre we?
- I Hope not.

11
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:27,539
These look kind of like blood.

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,914
Okay, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before.

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,524
But is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?

14
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,951
No, you guys, I'm serious. Think about it.

15
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,175
He always wears black.

16
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,673
We never see him in the daylight, only after dark.

17
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,827
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,911
That does describe a vampire...

19
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,359
or, you know, a bartender.

20
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:50,301
I should go get dressed.

21
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:51,864
Where you going, buddy? Hot date?

22
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,489
I'll say. She's going out with a billionaire.

23
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:56,409
Lily, I told you not to call him that.

24
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,013
Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?

25
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,057
He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred-millionaire.

26
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,847
Why do people always round up?

27
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,066
So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?

28
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:05,949
A charity dinner.

29
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,012
Yeah, $2,000 a plate.

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,303
$1,500. Stop rounding up.

31
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:11,995
And it's for Third World hunger.

32
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,224
You gonna put out?

33
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:14,719
What?

34
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,559
There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner,

35
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:19,976
and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.

36
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,263
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.

37
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,052
Well, I'm gonna be late.

38
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,104
You guys have fun.

39
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,224
- Bye.
- See ya.

40
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,226
- Bye.
- See ya.

41
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:31,111
You okay?

42
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,382
Sure. Why?

43
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:33,691
Oh, I don't know.

44
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:36,211
Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.

45
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,958
Okay, first of all, hundred-millionaire.

46
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:42,338
And second, she's not the girl of my dreams.

47
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,581
We're just friends.

48
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,383
Look, it would not be smart if we got together.

49
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,331
I mean, I'm looking to settle down, she's looking for...

50
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,691
Wha...? You done? Great.

51
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,869
Check out table number four.

52
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,181
See that little hottie on the end?

53
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,795
She's short, but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's, like, half boob.

54
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,792
Let's go.

55
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,522
Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?

56
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,347
I... uh...

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,267
Daddy's home.

58
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,376
Daddy's home? Okay, you want us to go over there right now

59
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:18,271
and say to those girls, "Daddy's home"?

60
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,431
Really think about that, Barney.

61
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,460
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.

62
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,029
Okay, think about this.

63
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:29,812
Is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?

64
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,813
Garlic fries.

65
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,711
Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

66
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:37,126
Oh, Daddy's back.

67
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,432
See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...

68
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:44,656
Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Date Card from Amy.

69
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,963
That worked?

70
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,961
I hate the world.

71
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,696
Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think.

72
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,931
I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.

73
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,818
- Doo-doo.
- Totally.

74
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:59,397
So I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.

75
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,183
Oh, yes, it can.

76
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,620
Interesting.

77
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,176
Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason.

78
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,426
It's like the universe was saying, "Hey, Barney, there's this dude-- he's pretty cool--

79
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,008
but it's your job to make him awesome."

80
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,617
Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way.

81
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,196
It happened with Robin, it happened with Half Boob,

82
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:23,741
and it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inibriation style.

83
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,398
So, what, you want me to do a shot?

84
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,476
Oh, no.

85
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:29,662
I want you to do five shots.

86
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,055
More interesting.

87
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:34,720
Barney, I think you've officially...

88
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:37,029
No, don't think. Do.

89
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,526
Ted, he's right: you overthink.

90
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,825
Maybe you should overdrink.

91
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:44,780
- Drink, drink...
- Drink, drink, drink...

92
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,015
Uh, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?

93
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,504
Guys, you are being immature and moronic, and drink, drink...

94
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:55,471
Drink, drink, drink...

95
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:56,962
Yeah!

96
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,857
Drink, drink, drink...

97
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,426
Let me tell you something about this dream, okay?

98
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,158
Drink!

99
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,014
Pure alcohol cannot stop this brain.

100
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,363
Drink, drink, drink...

101
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:08,769
I love it! I love it! I love it!

102
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:11,994
This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.

103
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,803
Drink, drink, drink...

104
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,721
This is a super brain.

105
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,393
Drink, drink, drink...

106
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:19,863
This brain is unstoppable.

107
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,056
This brain...

108
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,752
And that's all I remember.

109
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:25,371
Except for a few hazy memories.

110
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,571
But really, the next thing I remember was waking up the following morning.

111
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,030
So there were some unanswered questions.

112
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:00,666
How much did I drink?

113
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,309
How did I sprain my ankle?

114
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,471
And who was this girl in my bed?

115
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,729
There's our rock star.

116
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,761
Okay, uh... What the hell happened last night?

117
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,474
You really don't remember, Superbrain?

118
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,624
So Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lilly filled me in.

119
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,790
And how did you guys like the shots?

120
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:25,282
I drank all five, bitch.

121
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,179
I love Drunk Ted.

122
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,076
Marshall thinks you're a vampire.

123
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:36,278
If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.

124
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:37,941
No dibs.

125
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,877
No d... Damn it!

126
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:41,968
How quickly you all forget.

127
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:43,451
I haven't puked since high school.

128
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:46,286
I am vomit-free since '93.

129
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,617
Vomit-free since '93.

130
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,866
That's funny. I'm funny!

131
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,972
Who are you calling?

132
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:52,691
Robin.

133
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,306
Oh, bad idea jeans.

134
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:57,173
No, no, it's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk.

135
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,543
You do things you'd never do if you were sober.

136
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,998
Says every girl you've ever slept with.

137
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,434
Say what?

138
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,166
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

139
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,273
Oh, hi, Ted.

140
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,137
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

141
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:11,722
Hi, Ted.

142
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,214
Sounds like you're having fun.

143
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:17,949
Robin, have I ever told you that I am vomit-free since '93?

144
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,011
Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right...

145
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:22,434
'93?

146
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,370
Dude, that's impressive.

147
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:28,599
Robin, I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter.

148
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,519
You should be on 60 Minutes.

149
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,833
You should be one of the minutes.

150
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,956
That's sweet... and odd.

151
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,410
But I'm kind of on a date right now.

152
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:39,145
Yeah, and I disagree with Barney.

153
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,884
Just 'cause this guy's spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out.

154
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,421
Take it slow, Robin. Take it slow.

155
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,536
Slow...

156
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,692
Bye, Ted.

157
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,516
Slow...

158
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,826
Wow, right. That's why we don't do shots.

159
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,386
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.

160
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,514
I need that phone back.

161
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,655
You'll get this back at the end of class.

162
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:04,537
Ding. Class dismissed. Here you go, kid. You call whoever you want.

163
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:05,865
Thank you, kind sir.

164
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:10,017
At least someone appreciates the fact that I am doing and not thinking.

165
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:14,408
And now, I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.

166
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:19,187
Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions.

167
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:23,217
Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next? I don't know, but I want to find out.

168
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,256
Cheap Trick?

169
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,222
Oh, Ted.

170
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,417
Hello again, Ted.

171
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:39,462
# Hey, it's me again #

172
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:44,033
# Plain to see again #

173
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:50,854
# Please, can I see you every day #

174
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,058
I love everyone in this bar!

175
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,381
We love you, Drunk Ted!

176
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:59,788
# I'm a fool again #

177
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,367
# I fell in lo... #

178
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,189
Ted?

179
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,366
Well, that explains the ankle.

180
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,720
Then we brought you home and put you to bed.

181
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:12,411
Was there anyone else in there with me?

182
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:26,222
- There's a girl in there!
- I know.

183
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,188
- And a pineapple.
- I know.

184
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:30,257
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

185
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:34,492
What the hell happened to my jacket?

186
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:35,784
Whoa.

187
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:39,366
That girl in there is alive, right?

188
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,156
I should call Barney. Maybe he knows what happened.

189
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,075
Hello.

190
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,851
Why are you sleeping in our tub?

191
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,582
Uh, the porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.

192
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:12,325
Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?

193
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,310
Don't worry. I slept through it.

194
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,298
I totally didn't sleep through it.

195
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,287
Oh, and wow, for a little girl, you got a big tank.

196
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:25,451
How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around 1:00.

197
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,947
Oh, you put Ted to bed, all right.

198
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,310
You guys take care of me.

199
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,120
You guys are the best.

200
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:34,443
I love you guys so much.

201
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:36,187
Good night, Ted.

202
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:37,505
Love you, too, buddy.

203
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:42,375
I'm back, baby doll!

204
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,526
Hey! Hey! Hey!

205
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:46,161
He rallies!

206
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,167
And the night begins now!

207
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:51,286
All right. Game face on. Carl, two more.

208
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,498
All right, what do we think of this one?

209
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,409
- I think she...
- Trick question. No thinking.

210
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:02,013
You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride. Bring it!

211
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:04,263
Hi.

212
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,956
Have you met Ted?

213
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:11,657
Excuse me.

214
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,894
You're calling Robin.

215
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,307
I'm calling Robin.

216
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,874
Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.

217
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,161
Oh, yeah?

218
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:24,790
What you gonna do?

219
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:30,264
If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.

220
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,864
You're bluffing.

221
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,244
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

222
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,073
- Ted, for the last time, stop...
- Ow!

223
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:42,382
Ted?

224
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,919
You set me on fire.

225
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:46,984
Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast.

226
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:48,575
You got robbed. This is a blend.

227
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:52,705
You set me on fire.

228
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,045
And who's the girl in my bed?

229
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,296
There's a girl in your bed.

230
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:11,704
And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?

231
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,013
Who is she?

232
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,573
I have no idea.

233
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,799
Nice.

234
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:17,776
You really don't know who that is?

235
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:20,927
No. After I hosed you down with the beverage gun, I brought you back here.

236
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,735
I better not have gotten burned.

237
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:28,192
Did any of you write that?

238
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,952
"Hi. I'm Ted. If lost, please call..."

239
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,990
Whose number is that?

240
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,170
I don't know.

241
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,602
Dude, call it.

242
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,498
Ooh, hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.

243
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:46,677
Ooh. Okay, you can call now.

244
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:49,041
God, this is intense. I love it.

245
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,235
Hello?

246
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,759
Uh... hi. Who's this?

247
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,530
You called me. Who's this?

248
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,620
It's Ted.

249
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,641
It's Carl from the bar.

250
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,038
And then Carl filled us in.

251
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,332
Barney, you've always taken care of me.

252
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:08,912
You are a gentlemen and a scholar.

253
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,883
Go into my stable and take my finest stallion.

254
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,688
He's yours. His name is Windjammer.

255
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:17,483
Sleep it off, bro.

256
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,495
- I'm back, baby doll!
- Yeah.

257
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:27,936
And I... am gonna throw up.

258
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:30,854
I threw up?

259
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,558
Oh, my streak is over.

260
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:35,402
Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good.

261
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,648
Sorry, Carl. Go on.

262
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:45,108
Carl... did you know the word "karaoke" is Japanese for "empty orchestra"?

263
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,557
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?

264
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:50,187
Are you a vampire?

265
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,383
All right, I'm cutting you off.

266
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:54,076
Go home and get some sleep, Ted.

267
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,498
Yeah, the sun's gonna come up soon.

268
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:59,137
Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?

269
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,680
Hey, how easy do you think it would be to sneak into the zoo?

270
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:05,089
I have to see some penguins, like, right now.

271
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,672
All right, give me your arm.

272
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,343
Okay.

273
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,766
This way, if you pass out in the gutter...

274
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,359
It tickles.

275
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:17,482
...someone will call me, and I will come get you.

276
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:18,811
Thanks, Carl.

277
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:22,713
We can't just be friends. We're attracted to each other, and we both know it.

278
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:23,989
Excuse me?

279
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,960
Me and Robin, me and Robin.

280
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,477
I have to make one more call.

281
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,427
Yeah, this'll go good.

282
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,757
Hey, it's me again.

283
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,264
Look, who are we kidding?

284
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,101
You and I are both attracted to each other.

285
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:45,599
We're young, we're drunk-- half of us anyway-- and we only get one life.

286
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,977
So, why don't you come over to my apartment right now,

287
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:50,636
and we'll think of something stupid to do together?

288
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:51,899
Really?

289
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:52,882
Great.

290
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,247
Wait. Really?

291
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:55,895
Great.

292
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,760
Thanks, Carl.

293
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,167
It's Robin.

294
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,309
That's Robin in there.

295
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,217
Did you guys...?

296
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,074
Oh, come on. You've got to give me this one.

297
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,191
Those five shots got you further with Robin than your brain ever did.

298
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,748
See what happens when you don't think?

299
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,891
You do. More importantly, you do Robin.

300
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,603
Come on.

301
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,857
All right, right over here.

302
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,160
But, uh, still, what does this mean?

303
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,351
Are we dating now?

304
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:33,920
I-I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but...

305
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,925
maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...

306
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:38,416
Someone get him a shot. He's thinking again.

307
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:42,453
You know what? Hold on, man. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one.

308
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:46,318
You and Robin went down this road before. You got dinged up really bad.

309
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:49,929
You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin?

310
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:50,951
Robin.

311
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,448
Go wake her up.

312
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,368
Wake her up and say what?

313
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,024
Daddy's home.

314
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,419
Good luck, buddy.

315
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,535
Hello.

316
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,025
Ted, it's Robin.

317
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,628
Are you sure?

318
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:24,612
Hey, Robin, how are you?

319
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:28,366
Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night.

320
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,956
- Do you mind if I swing by?
- Ask her about the pineapple.

321
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,861
- Uh, yeah, sure, come on over.
- Thanks.

322
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,625
No. Wait, d-d-don't come...

323
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,858
She's coming over. Crap!

324
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:41,120
Wait. This is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is.

325
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,694
Trudy.

326
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,421
My name is Trudy.

327
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,041
And then, Trudy filled us in.

328
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,533
I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.

329
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:58,023
I know. It's two years of my life I'm never getting back.

330
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,533
A little part of me wants to just jump the bones of the next guy I see.

331
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,057
Daddy's home.

332
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,620
Or the one after that.

333
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,302
Okay, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so,

334
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:16,160
you just gave me your number... and your name is Amy.

335
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,469
Ladies.

336
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,439
I love everyone in this bar!

337
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:24,048
Look at that idiot go.

338
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,651
He's kind of cute.

339
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,121
What are you doing in the men's room?

340
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:38,032
What am I doing in the ladies' room?

341
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,696
All right, I came in here, 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.

342
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:42,727
Did you?

343
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,113
I did not.

344
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,524
And the streak continues-- vomit-free since '93.

345
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:54,289
I'm sorry, Trudy. Go on.

346
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,293
I liked your performance.

347
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,972
What, the karaoke?

348
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,448
Domo arigato.

349
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,108
I wish I had your guts.

350
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,957
Getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.

351
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,408
So, do it.

352
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,746
I don't know.

353
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,885
Still, I've had a pretty serious week.

354
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,342
I could sure stand to do something stupid.

355
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,430
I'm something stupid. Do me.

356
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,434
You're funny.

357
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,569
Hey, can I call you sometime?

358
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:20,847
Okay.

359
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:22,983
Here, let me.

360
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,622
Why do they call it karaoke, anyhow?

361
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,451
Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okey?

362
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,097
These are the kinds of things I think about.

363
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:37,617
Karaoke is Japanese for "empty orchestra."

364
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,733
That's hauntingly beautiful.

365
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,211
Hey, it works.

366
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:48,315
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.

367
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,959
I got to make one more call.

368
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:55,464
Hello?

369
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,583
Hey, it's me again.

370
00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:58,381
Hey.

371
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,148
Look, who are we kidding?

372
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,981
You and I are both attracted to each other.

373
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,867
We're-We're young, we're drunk--

374
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,646
half of us, anyway-- and we only get one life.

375
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,051
So, I came over here.

376
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:12,533
And now, I'm really, really embarrassed.

377
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,134
Damn it, Trudy! What about the pineapple?

378
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:18,117
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

379
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,947
Ah, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.

380
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,050
Why? Is that your girlfriend?

381
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:30,180
Ah, no, that's not my girlfriend. Um, look, it's complicated.

382
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,350
Oh, you're married. Yeah, I know. I can't believe I did this.

383
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:36,182
No, no, no, I-I'm not married. Um... I'll explain after you hide.

384
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:43,929
Hey.

385
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:44,698
Hi, guys.

386
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:47,219
- Hey, Robin, top of the morning.
- Hi, Robin. Good sweater.

387
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:52,267
Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was pretty drunk.

388
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,483
Uh, no kidding.

389
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,606
Those calls were really weird.

390
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:58,272
Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.

391
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,208
- Let's go get a snack.
- I love to snack.

392
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,373
I'm good.

393
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,975
Come on, those calls weren't that weird.

394
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,135
Robin! Come hang out!

395
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,428
Okay, I'm gonna make this sound till you come hang out.

396
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:29,265
That goes on for three and a half minutes.

397
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:30,706
Without a breath?

398
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,650
That's got to be some kind of record.

399
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,704
Oh, Ted, you can't do this. Please.

400
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:38,381
We agreed to be friends, and now you're making it all confusing.

401
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:41,889
No, I'm not. Look, I-I just turned off my brain for the night.

402
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:44,381
Nothing's changed. You've moved on. I've moved on.

403
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,691
Really? You've moved on?

404
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:48,835
Yes. What, you don't believe me?

405
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:51,681
Oh. Uh, okay.

406
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:54,590
Trudy, come on out.

407
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,310
You are gonna laugh.

408
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:58,191
Wait. You were with someone last night?

409
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,616
Yeah, Trudy. She's cool.

410
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,415
Trudy, come on out.

411
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,546
Yeah, seriously, it's okay.

412
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:08,253
This is so Trudy.

413
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:10,619
She's really shy...

414
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:11,922
I think.

415
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:13,980
Trudy?

416
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,469
Hi, Trudy. I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you.

417
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:26,075
You're right. She is shy.

418
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,350
I'm not making this up. She-she must have climbed out the fire escape.

419
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,248
Whatever. Whatever! I-I don't care what you think.

420
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,631
Then why'd you hide her from me?

421
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,577
Wow. You're good.

422
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,980
Anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?

423
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,394
Yes. You did... last night.

424
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,669
Really?

425
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,223
Get some sleep, Ted.

426
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,601
You had a long night.

427
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,480
And don't feel bad.

428
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,588
I've woken up with worse.

429
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:04,296
I left Trudy a message, but she never called me back.

430
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,751
That's just how life works sometimes.

431
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,492
You turn off your brain for a night,

432
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:11,418
and all your left with the next day is a bad hangover,

433
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:13,007
a sprained ankle...

434
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:17,718
Oh, we never found out where that pineapple came from,

435
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,428
but it was delicious.

1
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:17,491
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

2
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,159
Sure, it looks great on TV,

3
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,644
but in reality, it's always just a big let down,

4
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,838
but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,

5
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,806
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.

6
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,580
I had an idea of how to do it, too.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,304
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,548
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.

9
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,802
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.

10
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,840
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,060
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,843
This year we party together or not at all.

13
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,876
Now, I sifted through your party submissions

14
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,819
and I narrowed them down to these five.

15
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:04,444
Question?

16
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,978
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no,

17
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,442
we will not be attending any parties in your pants.

18
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:12,165
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?

19
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,348
Thas an actual picture of my pants.

20
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,043
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:17,310
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,937
and then narrow them down to one,

23
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:21,285
the most awesome party in New York City

24
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:25,797
and that is where we will ring,
nay rock, in the new year.

25
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,128
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?

26
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,180
Mary Beth?

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,862
Oh, she works in my office.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,718
She seems like she might be into me.

29
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,790
She's always finding reasons to hug me.

30
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:37,990
So tonight...

31
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:43,882
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,208
By who ?
Who asks you that?

33
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,971
And the answer is right here--

34
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,082
my own, personal "get psyched" mix.

35
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:55,376
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,

36
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,209
but people are wrong.

37
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,148
It should be all rise, baby.

38
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:03,186
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey

39
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:06,952
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,646
Bam.

41
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,318
It's working.

42
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,579
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.

43
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,451
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.

44
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,838
Must do robot.

45
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,824
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!

46
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,827
Oh, driver?

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,719
Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now.

48
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,784
That's awesome.

49
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:34,790
I've moved up in the world.

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,193
How do you guys know each other?

51
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:40,254
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.

52
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:41,826
Hey, what are we waiting for?

53
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,793
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.

54
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,891
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek

55
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,222
should be coming by any minute to pick me up.

56
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:52,612
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.

57
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,591
Derek.

58
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,228
He was like rich, successful, handsome.

59
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,773
I hated that guy.

60
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:00,730
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,405
Bye.

62
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,607
See ya next year.

63
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,817
Go get 'em.

64
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,567
Well, this kind of sucks.

65
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,660
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,967
We're a man down.

67
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,691
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.

68
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:15,863
Ranjit!

69
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,372
- Party number one.
- Party number one!

70
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,047
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.

71
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,672
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,742
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.

73
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:35,831
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.

74
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:37,652
We didn't really get a chance to meet.

75
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,859
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.

76
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,376
Hi. Mary Beth.

77
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,484
So great to meet you guys.

78
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:46,693
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.

79
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,848
American party friends of Barney's.

80
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:55,734
Oh, no.

81
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,661
So, Barney, who's your new friend?

82
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,413
Natalya.

83
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,985
Oh, friendly.

84
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,814
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She... Who knows?

85
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:08,877
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?

86
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,035
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?

87
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,450
Isn't she awesome?

88
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,740
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes,

89
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,482
but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

90
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,815
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?

91
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:28,253
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.

92
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:29,877
I need you to power through the pain.

93
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,429
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.

94
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,931
It's true.
I can hear them.

95
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,479
What's that, little boys?
What's that?

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
You wanna go for a... rock?

97
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:45,919
- Ranjit! Party number two.
- Party number two.

98
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,132
- Party number two?
- Not so good.

99
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,939
Let's go back to party number one.

100
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,396
No, no turning back.

101
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,330
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three. Yeah.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,696
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.

103
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,827
We left Natalya.

104
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:09,703
Barney, none of us really liked her.

105
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,423
- What?!
- Sorry.

106
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,110
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.

107
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,789
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,

108
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,755
I choose to turn my front on her. What up?

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,469
I'm sorry about Barney.

110
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,982
No, I'm having a great time.

111
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,274
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.

112
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,830
Me, too.

113
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,010
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.

114
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,774
Pfft. Derek.

115
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,627
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night

116
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:46,044
and I was already on a date with another girl.

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,222
But... it was Robin.

118
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:51,129
Ranjit, turn it around.

119
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,147
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.

120
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:04,090
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,456
No, this is perfect.

122
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,728
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.

123
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:08,910
What happened?

124
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,558
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.

125
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,915
Who works on New Year's Eve?

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,428
Okay.
Now I feel worse.

127
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,471
I was really looking forward to this night.

128
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,942
This sucks.

129
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,388
Oh, dude, not now!

130
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,726
What? She needs to get psyched.

131
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:30,846
Fine.

132
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,321
Maybe I should just go home.

133
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:38,008
My finger slipped.

134
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:42,237
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.

135
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,026
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?

136
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:46,014
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?

137
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:49,514
Fine. I'll kiss you at... 
a little bit after midnight.

138
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,101
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.

139
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,578
You're friendly.

140
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,662
I haven't eaten dinner yet.

141
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,020
Is there anything to eat in this thing?

142
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,550
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.

143
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,360
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,662
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.

145
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,923
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,

146
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:10,492
but we do have time for hot dogs?

147
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,035
Yeah, we like hot dogs.

148
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:15,139
No. No. We are already behind schedule.

149
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:15,784
Ted, come on.

150
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:19,359
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.

151
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,124
You don't know what you're missing.

152
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:23,981
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.

153
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,119
Which is exactly how much time I need.

154
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,262
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

155
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,527
Wait. Baby, what are you doing?

156
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,515
- I'm going home.
- What? No!

157
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,795
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.

158
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,207
There's a cab over there.

159
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,566
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.

160
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,644
But... hot dogs.

161
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:45,273
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.

162
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,760
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,003
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...

164
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,526
- party number three.
- Are you sure?

165
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,772
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.

166
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:58,778
We'll find each other.

167
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,909
We'll find each other.

168
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,835
I know we will.

169
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,529
Hell of a woman.

170
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:15,108
Let's go get some hot dogs!

171
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,226
Ranjit, party number three.

172
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,180
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!

173
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,596
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.

174
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,973
Eating hot dogs.

175
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,823
It's like we're the president.

176
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,900
Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.

177
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,943
Oh, so much better.

178
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,014
Guys.

179
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,727
Is that Moby?

180
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,384
I think that that's Moby.

181
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,555
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.

182
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,317
No way.

183
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,050
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.

184
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,645
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?

185
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,268
Moby! Hey, Moby!

186
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:55,788
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.

187
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,770
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.

188
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,523
- Hey.
- Hello.

189
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,214
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,519
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.

191
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,313
You want a ride?

192
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,489
Sure.

193
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,201
Welcome.

194
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,774
- Wow. You're friendly.
- Big fan.

195
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,615
Barney Stinson.

196
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:27,822
So, uh... what about this party?

197
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,825
It's just a New Year's thing.

198
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:30,971
You know, with some friends.

199
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,912
Wow, that sounds awesome.

200
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,484
You guys want to come?

201
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,909
Yeah, we'd love to.

202
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,580
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.

203
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,256
S idebar?

204
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,730
Um... Moby, switch up, will you?

205
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,157
Yeah, what's up?

206
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,184
- What about Lily?
- Call her.

207
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,065
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.

208
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,523
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.

209
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...

210
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,834
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting. I gotta...

211
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,376
I gotta find her.

212
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,815
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.

213
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,319
But... Come on!
Moby's party!

214
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,934
Moby's party!
Moby's par...

215
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,851
Ranjit.

216
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,088
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.

217
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,922
This is a cool mix.

218
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:29,475
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.

219
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,271
I think it should be all rise.

220
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:35,593
Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher.

221
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,351
This mix is my pride and joy.

222
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,038
I never leave home without it.

223
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,298
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.

224
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,060
Jan... Aah!

225
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,818
So then I say,

226
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,412
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."

227
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,229
You're not Moby, are you?

228
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:00,295
Who?

229
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,469
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.

230
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,661
No.

231
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,930
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."

232
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,898
I thought you said "Tony."

233
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,573
So your name is Tony?

234
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,583
No.

235
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,801
Oh, hey, we're here.

236
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,023
All right.

237
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,910
You guys going to come in?

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,826
Nah.

239
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,094
You're sure?

240
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,517
Come on. It's going to get nuts in there.

241
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,410
There's this dude who owes me money.

242
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,689
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.

243
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:35,032
Happy New Year, Not Moby.

244
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:43,151
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.

245
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,268
Why did we think that guy was Moby?

246
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:49,123
I don't know.

247
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,538
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.

248
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:58,518
That's Marshall's phone.

249
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,169
Hello.

250
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,013
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.

251
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:10,093
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?

252
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:11,613
He left his phone in the limo.

253
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,764
- He's out looking for you.
- What? Where?

254
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,348
Party number three.

255
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,131
Well, I'm here at party number three and...

256
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,717
Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in-- Moby!

257
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,659
Moby?! She's upstairs.

258
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,996
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.

259
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:31,437
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...

260
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,968
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!

261
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,252
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.

262
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:40,483
What are the odds?

263
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:44,550
Who was that guy?!

264
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,733
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.

265
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,920
Ranjit, drive!

266
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,140
- Where to?
- Party number three!

267
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,420
Party number three!

268
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,058
No, but I was just at party number three.

269
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,890
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.

270
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,347
You must have looked at the list wrong.

271
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:02,585
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,

272
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,362
you know what it's time for?

273
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:08,959
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.

274
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,698
Re-psy...

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,833
Where's the...?

276
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,025
Oh, my God!

277
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,710
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!

278
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,556
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!

279
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,867
Let it go.

280
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,779
We need to get back on schedule.

281
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,201
Ah, nuts.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,156
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?

283
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:42,311
No.

284
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,903
I am pissed.

285
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,476
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.

286
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,084
Okay.

287
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,511
Okay, not a problem.

288
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,477
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.

289
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,863
I wish Marshall would call.

290
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,409
I guess the circuits are jammed.

291
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,026
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed

292
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,641
because everyone's calling their loved ones,

293
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,053
everyone around the world.

294
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,945
Everyone except Barney.

295
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,103
Oh, sure, laugh.

296
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,336
Laugh for Barney Stinson.

297
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:17,013
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel

298
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:20,322
of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.

299
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:22,846
Round and round it goes.

300
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,677
And where's it all heading?

301
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,400
Nowhere.

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,496
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?

303
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,226
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?

304
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:36,901
No. No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.

305
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,009
We got to stay psyched.

306
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:43,101
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.

307
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,645
"Shot through the heart
And you're to blame, darling"

308
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:54,102
"You give love a bad name
A bad name"

309
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:58,409
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.

310
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,665
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"

311
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,453
It'll be fine.

312
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,975
We'll be out of here in a jiff.

313
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,322
Ted, I'm going to head out.

314
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:14,979
My roommates are having a party not far from here.

315
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,148
No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...

316
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,651
How long have you been in love with Robin?

317
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:22,931
I'm not in love...

318
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,003
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?

319
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:29,085
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.

320
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,159
And I can tell that she's into you, too.

321
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,641
That's ridiculous.

322
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,262
Wait. Really?

323
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,506
Happy New Year, Ted.

324
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,334
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.

325
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,983
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.

326
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,073
It's no big deal.

327
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:05,167
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.

328
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,780
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.

329
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,680
I suppose, in a way, I still am.

330
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:13,878
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.

331
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:17,277
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.

332
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,546
I'm sorry about your girl.

333
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:25,508
Sorry about your guy.

334
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,920
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.

335
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:33,983
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.

336
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:37,449
I did not, too.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,726
D erek.

338
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,261
- Hi. How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,366
Okay, how's this for a plan?

340
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,874
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.

341
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,973
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.

342
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:12,120
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?

343
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,765
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is,

344
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,767
which is New Year's Eve which is the single

345
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,460
biggest letdown of a night every single year.

346
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,864
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.

347
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,001
We've still got ten minutes.

348
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:28,792
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.

349
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,633
It doesn't exist.

350
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,930
Holy crap.

351
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,551
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.

352
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,173
So much to tell.

353
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,455
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--

354
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,303
I walked to the next party on the list.

355
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,267
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.

356
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,988
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.

357
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:04,972
And guess what I found.

358
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:09,316
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.

359
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:11,185
Yeah, I know.
Come on.

360
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,037
Come on! Oh! Oh!

361
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,242
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.

362
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,908
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.

363
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,286
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.

364
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:25,452
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.

365
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,615
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.

366
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:32,011
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.

367
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,298
How? We'll never get a cab.

368
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:35,551
The flat's fixed.

369
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,761
Let's do this!
Come on! In!

370
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:39,950
Go, go, go!

371
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,550
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?

372
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,139
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.

373
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,556
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?

374
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:48,755
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.

375
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:51,494
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.

376
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,332
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?

377
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,097
I get you there in six.

378
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,845
I don't think I can do it.

379
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,878
No! Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!

380
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,201
Three minutes!
Come on!

381
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,767
Ranjit, put her in park.

382
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,434
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,

383
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,597
but it's not the best party in New York.

384
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,765
'Cause this is, right here.

385
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,758
- Cheers. Well said.
- Cheers. Cheers.

386
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,188
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.

387
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:34,204
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down

388
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,676
that was right there in that limo.

389
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,929
Derek?!
Derek.

390
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:47,285
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.

391
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:55,721
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.

392
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,683
I can't believe you made it.

393
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,669
I made it, baby.

394
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,436
I super love you, okay?

395
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,477
Here, you need a mint.

396
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,898
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!

397
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,684
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.

398
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:21,766
Well, don't.

399
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,154
Not every night has a happy ending.

400
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:25,905
But all of it's important.

401
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,501
All of it was leading somewhere.

402
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,756
Because suddenly, it was 2006.

403
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,461
And 2006 was a big one.

404
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,097
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.

405
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,657
What about your guy?

406
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,005
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.

407
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:52,251
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.

408
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,466
Well, a deal is a deal.

409
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:09,741
Happy New Year.

410
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,585
Happy New Year.

1
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,425
When you're single, and your friends start to get married,

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,367
every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation:

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,563
"Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"

4
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,533
What it's really asking is,

5
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,555
"Where do you see yourself in three months?

6
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:29,873
Sitting next to your girlfriend, or hitting on a bridesmaid?"

7
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:32,808
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,287
I was an optimist.

9
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,726
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?

10
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,326
Ted, have you ignored all my teachings?

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,682
For the most part, yeah.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,143
No, you don't bring a date to a wedding.

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,687
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.

14
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,529
Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted. No-- no date.

15
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:52,241
Deer carcass? Really? That's the metaphor you're going with here?

16
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,858
Ted, it's a simile.

17
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,180
Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date,

18
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,330
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,991
I got to bring someone, but who?

20
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,916
Of course, I knew who I wanted to bring.

21
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,594
Robin-- the big unanswered question in my life.

22
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:10,234
Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.

23
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:12,058
Derek.

24
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:15,792
Well, Derek and I just broke up.

25
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:18,317
Oh, no, that's terrible! Are you okay?

26
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,842
Yeah, do you need a drink or something?

27
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,666
Nah... We never really clicked.

28
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,668
I felt bad, though. He was pretty bummed.

29
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,143
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

30
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,692
He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.

31
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:31,508
He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.

32
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,926
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

33
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,815
I think I'll get that drink now.

34
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,989
Okay, guys, I got to say something.

35
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:43,594
I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.

36
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,345
Oh, please-- they were buried in a shallow grave.

37
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,496
Not again. Come on. Dude?

38
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:52,115
We all know how this movie ends.

39
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:56,542
Ted falls in love, love kicks Ted in the sprouts, roll credits.

40
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,240
No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture.

41
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,315
Fact:

42
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,683
Robin was into me when we first met.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,079
Fact:

44
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:07,420
Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof.

45
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:08,864
Fact:

46
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,518
On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.

47
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:12,639
Fact:

48
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,425
I need a date to this wedding.

49
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:15,577
Wish me luck.

50
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,229
What I don't get is why is Claudia marrying Stuart?

51
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,014
She's way hotter than him.

52
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,192
How way?

53
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,905
Way way.

54
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,812
This wedding does sound pretty amazing, though.

55
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:31,013
Fancy hotel ballroom,

56
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:32,708
everybody all dressed up...

57
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,491
Oh, here we go.

58
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:35,089
What?

59
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,045
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans

60
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,204
because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,691
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.

62
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:43,584
I thought so.

63
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,852
You know what? Excuse me if I don't want to get married

64
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:50,802
barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-One's-Going-To-Drive-That-Far.

65
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,021
Yes. I want a ballroom,

66
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,738
and I want a band, and I want shoes.

67
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:58,733
I've been dreaming about this day since I was, like...

68
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,398
A little girl?

69
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:01,913
What up!

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,866
Okay. I'm just saying that it's my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.

71
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,944
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.

72
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:11,302
Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.

73
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,389
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.

74
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,128
I mean, seriously-- Claudia and Stuart?

75
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,840
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness,

76
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,485
but, you know, I was drunk.

77
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,304
There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.

78
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:29,916
You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship

79
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,308
is to celebrate someone else's successful one.

80
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,951
Oh, it makes sense.

81
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,191
So, with that in mind, uh, our friends Claudia and Stuart

82
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,624
are having this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.

83
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,388
You want to be my plus one?

84
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,813
Ooh... "Plus one." You make it sound so romantic.

85
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:45,918
Fine.

86
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,033
You want to be my date?

87
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,713
Your date?

88
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:52,823
I'd love to.

89
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,225
How fancy are we talking about here?

90
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,977
Oh, you're going to want to bring your "A" game.

91
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,173
Oh, I'll bring it.

92
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,585
I'll bring it so hard, the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.

93
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,302
Lily? I need a dress.

94
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,138
You're going? That's awesome!

95
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,031
Oh, my God-- four days to find a dress?

96
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,704
I know, it's a suicide mission.

97
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:14,697
Well, if we leave now... we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it!

98
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:15,816
Bye, babe.

99
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,642
Whoa! Did you see how fired up she was?

100
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,236
I don't know, there's something there.

101
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,747
And, come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne...

102
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,504
Who  knows?

103
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,145
Wow. Ted, you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,

104
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,627
'cause I'm revoking your "dude" membership.

105
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,195
Yeah... how was that manicure yesterday?

106
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,427
Invigorating, thanks.

107
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,511
Okay, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,

108
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,205
but  back then I really thought that's how it worked.

109
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:50,334
You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting...

110
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,490
the stars line up...

111
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,961
and shazam.

112
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,951
I know now that life is never that simple.

113
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,090
Hey, Claudia!

114
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,753
Yes, I want Tahitian Vanilla! You wrote it down wrong?

115
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,296
No, no, no, no, listen to me--

116
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,936
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian Vanilla,

117
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,359
I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground!

118
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,258
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?

119
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:17,171
Yeah, good-bye.

120
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,746
Hey!

121
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,287
How's it going?

122
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,864
My wedding is in two days, that's how it's going.

123
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,418
Oh, don't worry, it's going to be great. I'm so excited.

124
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,311
Well, you should be-- lots of single girls.

125
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:34,098
Oh, well, yeah, I'm... bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.

126
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,941
What?

127
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm bringing a date.

128
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:37,700
You're not bringing a date.

129
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,420
Uh... yes, I am.

130
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,648
Uh, no, you're not.

131
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,635
I checked "plus one."

132
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:43,798
No, you didn't.

133
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,016
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...

134
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,763
Ted, you did not check "plus one"!

135
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,656
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

136
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,159
Wait, I've already invited someone.

137
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:56,883
You are not bringing a guest, Ted!

138
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,174
The guest list has been closed for months-- months!

139
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:01,877
But I checked "plus one"! I always check "plus one"!

140
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,139
You absolutely did not check "plus one"!

141
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,431
If you had checked "plus one," I would have called you to get the name of your guest,

142
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,029
so I could have the place cards printed up.

143
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,372
Did I call you to get the name of your guest?

144
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,292
Is there a place card with her name printed on it?

145
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,763
She doesn't need a place card. She knows her name.

146
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,307
What's she eating?! Huh?! You ordered the chicken. What did she order?

147
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:18,796
Do you see how your story is full of holes?

148
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:21,406
Come on, Claudia, we go way back.

149
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,392
Isn't there room for just one more person?

150
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,386
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.

151
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:29,281
I don't believe this! Claudia's crazy!

152
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,243
But, to be fair, she's also hot.

153
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,559
I totally checked "plus one." I'm sure I did.

154
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:34,845
- Yeah, right.
- I did!

155
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:37,259
Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why?

156
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,961
Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

157
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:44,783
See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down, you're single.

158
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,553
It's your default setting.

159
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,402
Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?

160
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,692
Oh, great, here comes the little Barney speech.

161
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:56,400
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?

162
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,624
- A little Barney...
- A little Barney.

163
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,656
A little Barney.

164
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,190
And you know what he said?

165
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:07,318
"Ted... you will bring no dates to this wedding.

166
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:12,199
You... will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."

167
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,999
Wow. Please stop.

168
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,447
I got to call Claudia. If I just explain to her...

169
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,332
Ted, no! Let it go.

170
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,792
She's about to get married, she's got enough to worry about.

171
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,143
Then what am I going to do?

172
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,686
The only thing you can do-- tell Robin she can't come.

173
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,982
Just a second!

174
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:34,953
- Hey!
- Hey. Listen...

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,819
Wait, two things. First of all... I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.

176
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:42,108
Totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging, just:

177
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,468
the theme of today is, "Ted rocks."

178
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,314
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

179
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,565
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no.

180
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,641
Thing number two: the dress.

181
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,205
We got a dress.

182
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,693
Go.

183
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,166
Well?

184
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:01,981
Did I bring it, or... did I bring it?

185
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,484
I think I brought it.

186
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,016
Wow.

187
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,217
That's what I was going for.

188
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,582
I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun.

189
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:13,407
Yeah, about that...

190
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,423
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

191
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,828
So? The dress?

192
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,843
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.

193
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:26,639
What?

194
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,929
I ran into Claudia, and she told me I didn't check "plus one" on the reply card.

195
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,675
- Why didn't you check "plus..."?
- I did check "plus one."

196
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,160
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.

197
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,531
-  And the dress!
- I know.

198
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,271
Okay, okay. Well, we'll sneak her in.

199
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,790
We can't sneak her in, we're not Ninjas.

200
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,271
- Oh, I wish we were Ninjas.
- I know.

201
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,521
You could always ask Stuart.

202
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,543
Can I do that?

203
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:50,515
Well,  sure.

204
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,850
You guys have been friends for a long time.

205
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,347
And it's 40% his wedding, too.

206
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,698
I don't know... it's going to be a tough sell.

207
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:00,696
Dude, no problem whatsoever.

208
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:01,414
Really?

209
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,147
Sure, the more, the merrier.

210
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,716
Wow! Wow, thanks for being so cool about this,

211
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,135
'cause you know, Claudia said...

212
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,748
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This morning at the rehearsal,

213
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:12,014
Claudia called our seven-year-old flower girl a whore.

214
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,995
So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.

215
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah, she's not usually like that.

216
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,809
No.

217
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,896
Well, thanks, Stu!

218
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,060
It's going to be a great wedding.

219
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,350
Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting

220
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,981
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.

221
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,859
Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods,

222
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,682
like a couple of squirrels.

223
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,421
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.

224
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,182
Like you could possibly know that.

225
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,142
I did it. I did it-- I'm taking her to the wedding.

226
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,034
Nice!

227
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:47,911
What? How?

228
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:49,138
I talked to Stuart.

229
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,633
You went around the bride.

230
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:54,258
"Oh, this hornets' nest looks harmless.

231
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,479
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.

232
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,532
Oh, look, some Gremlins. Let me go feed them after midnight!"

233
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,025
Did you know about this?

234
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,794
It may have been my idea.

235
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:05,272
What?

236
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,281
Stuart doesn't get a say?

237
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,514
Ah! So you admit it-- the groom should have an equal say.

238
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,033
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.

239
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,212
So I can invite whoever I want?

240
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,604
Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.

241
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:22,909
It's Claudia.

242
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,678
So it begins.

243
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,318
Come on, it can't be that bad.

244
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,584
Here, Lily, you answer it.

245
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:30,702
What? Why?

246
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,343
Because this whole thing was your idea.

247
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:33,556
And... Claudia scares me.

248
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,732
But... but you're the... But I just want to...

249
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:38,414
Ted's phone.

250
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,373
Oh, hi, Claudia.

251
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,186
What?

252
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,563
Now I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it went something like this...

253
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:48,665
Oh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him

254
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,407
he could bring his date to the wedding.

255
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,001
You what?

256
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,769
...always undermining me at every turn...

257
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,006
...try to show a little flexibility, but no!

258
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:04,489
It's all about you!

259
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,313
...and your mother...

260
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:13,739
You know what?

261
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,190
The wedding's off!

262
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,803
They broke up!

263
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:20,881
O w!

264
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,486
It's not because of me, is it?

265
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,374
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!

266
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,309
Oh, he's going to kill me!

267
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,188
And then he's gonna kill Ted!

268
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,242
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

269
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,407
It's Robin.

270
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:36,560
Answer it!

271
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:38,003
Uh, Lily's phone.

272
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:41,998
Ted, where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.

273
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh, Lily's busy.

274
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,187
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's going to love them.

275
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,468
That's great, I'll tell Lily to tell me.

276
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,692
Uh, listen, I really want to keep talking, um, but now's not a good time,

277
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,104
so I'm really excited about tomorrow, okay, bye.

278
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:56,733
Okay, bye.

279
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,797
Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this.

280
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,853
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus!

281
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:06,260
Okay, okay, sweetie, just calm down.

282
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:07,923
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

283
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,119
I want to go somewhere and drink!

284
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,073
Okay, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.

285
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,189
Oh, I feel terrible.

286
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:17,665
Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this.

287
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,460
Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia.

288
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,130
Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.

289
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,904
Um, tell Claudia I'm sorry.

290
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,120
Did she seem pissed at me?

291
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,781
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.

292
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,112
What say we get these crazy kids back together?

293
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,885
Hi, sad eyes.

294
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,807
What's got you down?

295
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:46,311
Stuart and I just broke up.

296
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:50,857
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's...

297
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,658
Two vodka cranberries, please.

298
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:56,254
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.

299
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,586
Remember?

300
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:00,283
When it comes to you, how can I forget?

301
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,780
They all drink vodka cranberries.

302
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:10,546
So... is there anything else you need... sweetie?

303
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,748
You got $400,000?

304
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:14,900
No.

305
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,052
But I do have a hug.

306
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,762
Thank you.

307
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,843
Stuart, I-I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...

308
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,632
Ted, for all I know, you did me the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.

309
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,457
Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.

310
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:37,876
No, I do-- this whole thing has made me realize I miss being single.

311
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:41,155
I miss staying out late, and making messes and not cleaning them up.

312
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,635
I miss owning porn.

313
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,309
Dude, who doesn't?

314
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:47,584
And you know, I'll see some super-hot model chick, and I'll think,

315
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,400
"Why am I with Claudia? I could be with her."

316
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,918
That's just crazy!

317
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,849
I mean... you're the luckiest... You and Claudia both...

318
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,450
The point is I want to get married. I want to settle down,

319
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,251
but right now, that's just not who I am.

320
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,336
I'm not a commitment guy; I'm a single guy.

321
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,023
Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other.

322
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,594
Everybody feels this way sometimes.

323
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,948
Relationships aren't easy; they're hard work.

324
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,524
It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap.

325
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,153
How would you know? You're not even married.

326
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:18,398
Okay, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily.

327
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,141
He's the pro-- this guy knows relationships.

328
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,230
Tell him, Marshall.

329
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,246
Stuart, don't get married.

330
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,365
- Dude...
- What?

331
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,521
Look, I'm sorry.

332
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:31,838
Being in a couple is hard. And committing, making sacrifices, it's hard.

333
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,633
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

334
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:37,262
Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life,

335
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,592
that should be the easiest thing in the world, and if it's not like that,

336
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,163
then she's not the one. I'm sorry.

337
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,079
You  know I don't have $400,000, right?

338
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,488
Maybe we got together too young.

339
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,021
Maybe that's what the problem was.

340
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,809
I mean, I'm 28 years old,

341
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:05,472
and I've really only ever been with one man.

342
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,548
That's just, that's...

343
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,562
Two more vodka cranberries, please!

344
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:17,999
Claudia... it's all gonna be okay.

345
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:22,038
Oh, thanks for listening, Barney.

346
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:24,484
It really means a lot to me.

347
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,289
Isn't it weird that we should... run into each other like this?

348
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:34,580
Two souls, of equal levels of attractiveness,

349
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:40,949
both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

350
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,974
- Oh, hell, no!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

351
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,991
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

352
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,422
and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her,

353
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,335
I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles,

354
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,956
and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out,

355
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,557
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes!

356
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,074
Wait, my eyes or my testicles?

357
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:04,448
One of each.

358
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,706
All right! All right!

359
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,000
Claudia?

360
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,114
Stuart.

361
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,324
I'm so sorry.

362
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,742
I'm so sorry, too.

363
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:13,828
I love you.

364
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,367
I love you too, babe.

365
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,209
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

366
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,259
And when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize I...

367
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:21,141
Marshall said what?!

368
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,115
It's more complicated than that!

369
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,669
He made me realize how much I love you.

370
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,427
These guys got us back together.

371
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,017
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

372
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:45,424
So where did we land on the whole plus one thing?

373
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,703
No, no, no, no!

374
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,931
It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia,

375
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:55,792
but, eventually, she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.

376
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,209
Still wow.

377
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,179
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.

378
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,342
Oh, yeah. I thought about leaving it at home,

379
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:08,805
but I figured I don't want to get there and realize I need it

380
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,759
and have to go all the way back to get it. So, yeah, I brought it.

381
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:14,946
Oh, sorry.

382
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,248
Hello?

383
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,507
Oh, my God. Tonight?

384
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,713
You're kidding.

385
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,748
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

386
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,391
Really?

387
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,902
Like anchor anchor?

388
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,309
What happened to Sandy?

389
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:34,707
Okay.

390
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,548
Okay. Sure. What time do you need me to...

391
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,851
Right now?! Oh.

392
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:41,991
Do it.

393
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,181
Do it.

394
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:52,206
Okay, I need like five minutes to change, and, um, I'll call you from the cab...

395
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,167
So admit it.

396
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:06,959
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

397
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:09,999
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.

398
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,209
The crab puffs were incredible.

399
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,999
We should totally have them at our wedding.

400
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,046
Definitely...

401
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,424
Hey. We just agreed on something.

402
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,234
Did we just start planning our wedding?

403
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,556
I think that we did.

404
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:26,566
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.

405
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,258
Ooh, I thought the red sauce was, like, awesome.

406
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:32,401
My God, were you born without taste buds?

407
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,593
What?

408
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,576
I love you.

409
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,137
Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls?

410
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,292
The answer may surprise you... after the break.

411
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,519
Man, you know something? Stuart's my new hero.

412
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,590
If that dude can bag a nine,

413
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,432
I got to be able to bag, like, a 16.

414
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,759
What's a 16?

415
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,766
Those two eights right over there.

416
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,693
Yeah.

417
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,904
Hi, Ted.

418
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:12,949
Claudia.

419
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,312
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.

420
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,603
Yeah, where is she?

421
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,479
Um... she couldn't make it.

422
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,562
What's so funny?

423
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,149
Oh, plan a wedding. You'll see.

424
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,885
Look at that.

425
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,797
That's how it's supposed to be. That right there.

426
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:39,943
Easy, simple.

427
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,601
It's just not like that with Robin.

428
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:48,732
It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.

429
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,241
Speaking of easy... bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.

430
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:56,496
By the way, I almost forgot.

431
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,173
We found this.

432
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,300
I didn't check "plus one."

433
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,827
You were right.

434
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,394
Of course, I was right.

435
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,315
I'm single.

436
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,935
Maybe that's just who I am.

437
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,254
And you know what? I like being single.

438
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,130
Being single's the best.

439
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,023
Yeah, stay out as late as you want.

440
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:19,946
Answer to no one.

441
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,550
The whole world full of endless possibilities.

442
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,863
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

443
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:32,087
Okay. Ah... doing some math here.

444
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,116
Table six has got three bridesmaids: an eight, an eight, and a seven.

445
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,307
I am willing to give you one of the eights, lowering myself to a 15,

446
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,556
which means you owe me...

447
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:48,765
So there we were, two single guys, doing our usual single-guy thing.

448
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:53,408
For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point,

449
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,869
that this was the night my life-- my real life-- would finally begin.

450
00:20:58,322 --> 00:20:59,785
The funny thing is...

451
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,760
I wasn't totally wrong.

452
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,961
Because that night was just beginning.

453

1
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:17,740
Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments.

2
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,409
And they make life worth living.

3
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:20,725
But here's the problem:

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,214
moments pass,

5
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:25,393
and lurking just around the corner from those moments

6
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:29,227
is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.

7
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,979
And so, back in 2006,

8
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,513
on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding,

9
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,294
reality was the enemy.

10
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,677
Wow. The Peace Corps?

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,242
Yeah. I ship out tomorrow-- two years.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,453
You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do.

13
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,627
To those people, I say, "Is it?"

14
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:51,504
And usually they say, "Yes, it is."

15
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,953
Barney, they are so right.

16
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,964
I wish there was something I could do.

17
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:57,535
Oh, Tanya...

18
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,508
I'm so glad you said that.

19
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,653
This wasn't how I'd thought the night would turn out.

20
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:07,411
This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin.

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,444
But then reality came along.

22
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:13,883
Robin got called up last-minute to anchor the 11:00 news.

23
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:15,395
It was her big break.

24
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:18,025
And I went to the wedding stag.

25
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,913
Then, when I least expected it...

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,531
Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?

27
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:37,743
I had the most amazing night ever.

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,693
Tell me about it. That cake. Best cake I ever had.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,566
Seriously. My stomach was, like,

30
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,243
"Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating, 'cause I don't have any eyes,

31
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:48,250
but it's basically awesome, so keep sending it down Gullet Alley."

32
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,397
Yeah, I know.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,649
My stomach was, like, "Girlfriend, we don't always get along, but that cake..."

34
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:54,587
Lily.

35
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:58,799
Oh, right. "Most amazing night ever," and go.

36
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,112
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

37
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,413
I never hook up at weddings.

38
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:07,068
I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.

39
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,759
Well, here's the thing, those big romantic moments,

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,707
they're great when they happen, but they're not real.

41
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:17,723
Exactly, exactly-- like-like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there,

42
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,331
I'm not gonna lie to you, big-time thunderbolt.

43
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:22,411
Mm. You should see me tap dance.

44
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,140
You'd be down on bended knee.

45
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,354
Sadly not out of character.

46
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,115
But I know now it's just a mirage.

47
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,653
Wedding goggles.

48
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:34,523
Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

49
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:36,035
This isn't the moves?

50
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,798
What, you... you think this is the moves?

51
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,660
Believe me, you'd know the moves.

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,288
People ten tables away would know the moves.

53
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,993
Oh, that's too bad.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,201
Tell me about it.

55
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:49,131
You know, I think... I have a solution.

56
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,244
Interested.

57
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:54,329
And to preface this, we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

58
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,681
Less interested.

59
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:57,288
Go ahead.

60
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,218
Okay.

61
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:01,933
So the thing that always screws it up is the next day.

62
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,905
Right? So...

63
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:06,764
Why don't we just cut that part out?

64
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,629
What are you saying?

65
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:12,974
I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, this is a big romantic wedding--

66
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,706
why don't we just dance and have a great time,

67
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,844
and then when it's over, never see each other again.

68
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,463
- Unless...
- No. No unless.

69
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,408
No e-mails, no phone numbers, not even names.

70
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:34,035
Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished.

71
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:37,158
And then... when we're old and gray,

72
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,355
we'll look back on this night

73
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,035
and it'll be perfect.

74
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:43,674
Wow.

75
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,604
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

76
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,731
I guess, uh, what, we'll need fake names?

77
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:53,013
Um... you can call me Buttercup.

78
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,333
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

79
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,607
I'm... Lando Calrissian.

80
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,803
Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...

81
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,698
Ted, Ted, Ted. Look, I got a bridesmaid.

82
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,030
Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid.

83
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,371
Ted, look. See ya, Ted.

84
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,502
So, I'm Ted.

85
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:13,941
Victoria.

86
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,078
- But no last names.
- No last names.

87
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,736
Oh, what is wrong with you?

88
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,994
Dude, that is just, like... a weenie-ass idea.

89
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,359
No, it was awesome-- I had a great night,

90
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,962
I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.

91
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:32,913
Ted, how do I explain this to you?

92
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:36,484
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

93
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,369
Now, you think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life?

94
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,252
Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake,

95
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,150
and then I'm gonna get some more cake.

96
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,628
That cake really got to you, huh?

97
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,088
It haunts me.

98
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,267
So, what happened next?

99
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,437
Okay.

100
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,075
Ground rules have been established.

101
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:56,419
Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.

102
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,354
Wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait.

103
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.

104
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,959
Yes, but we'll need... a diversion.

105
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,016
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

106
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,389
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

107
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,441
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

108
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,254
So  that's what happened to the bouquet.

109
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:27,441
You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.

110
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,361
You're not gonna do it at your wedding?

111
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,715
Hell, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower-grenade and chuck it into the crowd

112
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,229
and scream, "Crawl for it, bitches!"

113
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,661
That's just what girls do.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,241
So, where'd you guys go?

115
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:52,443
Very nice.

116
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,435
Yeah?

117
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,343
Okay, I don't really know how to tap dance.

118
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,033
I couldn't tell. Really.

119
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,393
Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.

120
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,193
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.

121
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,366
No, you couldn't.

122
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:10,034
You're a dude.

123
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,635
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

124
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:19,933
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

125
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:26,017
If-if we kiss, all of this becomes real.

126
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:28,589
You-you might use too much tongue.

127
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:32,211
I might not use enough. And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.

128
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,750
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.

129
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,167
Okay, how about this?

130
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,964
The best part of any first kiss is the lead-up to it.

131
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:51,607
The moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll.

132
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:57,691
So... how about tonight, we just stick with the drumroll?

133
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:00,323
Okay.

134
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,587
But we can't kiss.

135
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,037
Okay.

136
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,812
A drumroll?

137
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,029
That's it?

138
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:31,061
So, what, you just... you said good night, came home and...

139
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:33,284
performed a drum solo?

140
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,672
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!

141
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,587
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.

142
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,454
She was completely amazing.

143
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:44,769
She was amazing and funny, and we connected on every level,

144
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,612
and I'm never gonna see her again.

145
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,113
Damn it, I have to see her again!

146
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,497
- Yes!
- Yes!

147
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,647
So let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?

148
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:57,292
Nothing. Her name's Victoria-- that's all I got.

149
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,129
Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.

150
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:00,641
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.

151
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,601
She'll be back in two weeks-- call her then.

152
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,698
Yes, two weeks. Good idea.

153
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:05,751
I'm calling her now.

154
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,402
No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.

155
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:09,876
Yeah, come on, dude.

156
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,103
Ask her about the cake.

157
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:15,165
Ted?

158
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:19,185
Hey, Claudia! Great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff.

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,268
How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl,

160
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,250
and I was wondering if you had...

161
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:27,382
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!

162
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,741
Aw, here we go.

163
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:33,557
24 hours ago, you were begging... begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding,

164
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,633
and now, well, uh, you're over her?

165
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,275
I've moved on?

166
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,233
What was her name?

167
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,285
Is it my fat cousin Lindsay?

168
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,040
Don't be embarrassed-- she has pretty eyes.

169
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,302
Uh, no. Her name was Victoria. I don't know her last name.

170
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:49,583
Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.

171
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,795
Thank God.

172
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:55,035
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.

173
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,394
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

174
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,434
Maybe she used a second fake name.

175
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,826
Oh, she's good, she's very good.

176
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:10,255
Maybe she was ghost.

177
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,592
That's why she didn't want to kiss you--

178
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,291
because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second.

179
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,765
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.

180
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,095
Marshall... she was not a ghost!

181
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,819
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

182
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,585
She picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.

183
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:28,179
Wait-wait! She was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids.

184
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,393
She must've been at their table. Maybe they know who she was.

185
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:33,009
Great. So how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?

186
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,789
This better be good-- I am about to enter Nirvana.

187
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:42,597
By the way, I should get you Nirvana's phone number. She gives a great massage.

188
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:43,632
Say what?!

189
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,166
- Barney!
- Ow!

190
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:48,803
I know the house rules. Es un chiste!

191
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,418
Listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night.

192
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:53,920
Did you happen to get her phone number?

193
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,188
You know I did.

194
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,087
Great! Um, I'm gonna need you to call her for me.

195
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,898
You know I won't.

196
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,484
Why not?

197
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,523
Because  we just hooked up last night.

198
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,545
I can't call the girl the next day.

199
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,407
I have to wait at least, like... forever.

200
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:10,513
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.

201
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,184
Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.

202
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,294
Oh, come on, Barney, it's for a good cause.

203
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:22,089
Uh,  Ted going all castrati over yet another girl is exactly not a good cause.

204
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:24,263
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you-- my hands are tied.

205
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,218
Oh, no, wait-- that was last night.

206
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,594
Okay, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

207
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,715
You make this call and I will go with you...

208
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,304
to Foxy Boxing.

209
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,241
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,090
But you always said the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing.

211
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,614
I'm ready to be proven wrong.

212
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:45,720
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

213
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:46,836
Dial.

214
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,575
Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps till tomorrow.

215
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,206
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

216
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,454
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

217
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:58,097
Anyway, this girl-- any idea who she was?

218
00:10:59,148 --> 00:10:59,953
Hold on.

219
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,874
What kind of shoes was sh... No, Tanya, he's a dude.

220
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,109
He's not going to know what kind of shoes she was wearing.

221
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,202
Actually...

222
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,839
Oh, come on.

223
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:09,400
Hey!

224
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,266
So what do you want to do next?

225
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:15,384
Don't think. First thing that comes into your mind.

226
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,817
Hold... this...

227
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:21,406
and this...

228
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,054
Whoa!

229
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,019
There she goes.

230
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:31,320
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes...

231
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,203
...with little snowflakes on them.

232
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,602
Yeah, they do sound cute.

233
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,845
Any idea who...?

234
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,636
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.

235
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:43,769
Yeah, you take ca...

236
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:44,708
What's...?

237
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,253
Tonight?

238
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,431
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early, so I won't be able to stay over,

239
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,550
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

240
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,849
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

241
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,530
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

242
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:57,594
I understand.

243
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,120
Okay, uh, let's not lose hope.

244
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,962
We'll call the hotel. Maybe she was staying there.

245
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,051
We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria.

246
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,087
Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...

247
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,067
Or Ictor.

248
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,980
She probably doesn't go by "Ictor."

249
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,272
No, you know what?

250
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:17,561
This is fate.

251
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,184
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

252
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,449
That was the whole point of the night.

253
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,705
I have just been saved from myself.

254
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:23,874
Let's drink many beers.

255
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,781
Agreed.

256
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,868
And I thought that was the end of it.

257
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:28,074
But then...

258
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:35,492
Hey! There's the anchor lady!

259
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:36,403
How was it?

260
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:40,004
Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor?

261
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:44,063
Robin? Thanks, Robin! It was awesome. Back to you, Robin.

262
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,724
Congrats! That's so cool!

263
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,013
Yeah,  I felt really bad bailing on Ted, though.

264
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,397
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

265
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,705
And then Lily told her the whole story,

266
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,158
right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them.

267
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:58,611
And by the end of it...

268
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:00,736
What?

269
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,143
I know who she is.

270
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:10,259
You know who she is? But you weren't even at the wedding.

271
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,892
Actually, I kind of... was.

272
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:14,923
What?

273
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,697
Well, after the newscast, I was so excited

274
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:20,749
I decided to surprise Ted  by going to the reception.

275
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:35,123
Oh, damn it!

276
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:36,915
Oh, stop it!

277
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:38,344
What the hell!

278
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,386
Hello?

279
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,085
You okay in there?

280
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,423
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...

281
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,427
Just allergies or something.

282
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,477
I'm fine.

283
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,040
Listen, do you... want to come and cry out here?

284
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:56,515
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

285
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:57,626
Oh, thanks.

286
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:01,976
But I don't actually cry in front of people or...

287
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,637
cry at all, for that matter.

288
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:07,351
Oh, man, it's gross.

289
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,986
Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?

290
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:14,243
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

291
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,491
So, why are you crying?

292
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,692
Because you have feelings for Ted.

293
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,228
I don't know.

294
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:24,555
Maybe?

295
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:28,510
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you! Seriously!

296
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,594
He likes you and you like him. And j-j-just be together!

297
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,335
Cheese Louise! Happiness is not that difficult!

298
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:40,382
Look, okay, yes. I cried in the bathroom and that... was weird.

299
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,872
But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy.

300
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:45,727
The fact is, I-I don't know how I feel.

301
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,312
Yes, you do!

302
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,958
Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?

303
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,891
Guess what? That's how you feel.

304
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,501
That is nothing but how you feel.

305
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,578
Okay, fine. I have feelings for him.

306
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,495
Happy?

307
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,005
Kinda, yeah.

308
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,087
But it doesn't change anything.

309
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:08,597
I still don't want to get married and he's still... Ted.

310
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:13,144
What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he can be happy.

311
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,273
Or you could tell him that you're into him and then you could both be happy.

312
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:19,444
I'm going to go find him.

313
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:21,960
Well, wait.

314
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,800
Which one are you going to tell him?

315
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,014
I have no idea.

316
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,063
And here's the most amazing part--

317
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:33,472
Because I told her I'd converted all my money to India dollars,

318
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:36,547
she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport.

319
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,143
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

320
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:43,320
I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.

321
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:44,812
Hi, guys.

322
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:45,904
Hey.

323
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,830
Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?

324
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,652
Yeah, sure.

325
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,606
What's up?

326
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,956
Um... I, uh, I have to tell you something.

327
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,465
Oh...

328
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,703
Oh, just get it.

329
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:58,661
Hello?

330
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,572
Ted? It's Stuart.

331
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,175
My lovely bride would like to say something to you.

332
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:12,727
Ted... I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

333
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:16,010
My new husband, and the vodka cranberry,

334
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,906
which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar...

335
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,138
When is this plane going to board?!

336
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:23,051
Sweet pea?

337
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,354
...have  helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person,

338
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:35,455
and I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.

339
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,941
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.

340
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:41,685
Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.

341
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,710
The cake?

342
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,023
Why don't you take this?

343
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,512
Sounds like you could use it.

344
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:50,799
Thanks.

345
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,509
You're very sweet.

346
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:56,440
So are you a friend of the bride or groom?

347
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,554
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

348
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,034
Actually neither.

349
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:02,012
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

350
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,835
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

351
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,353
I made the cake.

352
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,388
She made the cake.

353
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,283
She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest.

354
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,868
She made the cake.

355
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:23,039
She made that cake? Ted, this is the girl.

356
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,882
You got to marry her. Today.

357
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,337
She has to move in with us.

358
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:27,888
I'm going down to that bakery.

359
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:29,197
No, no. Don't do it.

360
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,080
Baby, what are you talking about?!

361
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,905
Yeah, all day long you been busting my apple-bag about finding this girl.

362
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:39,100
Well, I-I just think that... that maybe she's not that into you.

363
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,520
And-and that's why she didn't give you her number.

364
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,307
Robin?

365
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,097
Care to chime in with anything?

366
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:49,599
Yes.

367
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:51,654
Ted...

368
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,098
Go get her.

369
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,343
Going. Getting.

370
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,307
Ted, oh, my, gosh, I love this moment. You know why?

371
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,246
'Cause I'm going to say it, and this time, you're actually going to say yes.

372
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,375
You ready? You ready to say yes?

373
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,022
Ted, suit up.

374
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:05,919
Yes!

375
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:06,982
No.

376
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:08,272
Oh, come on!

377
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,485
Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.

378
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,285
Oh, that's too bad.

379
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,783
I was looking forward to one last dance.

380
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,617
Well, yes, I am.

381
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,184
Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.

382
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,877
Wow, what was I just thinking?

383
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,266
"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux."

384
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,491
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah. Mmm.

385
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:52,783
You know, I don't look like this every day.

386
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,931
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.

387
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:01,768
Mmm. The real Ted sounds real sexy.

388
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,292
Too bad I'll never get to see it.

389
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,503
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

390
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:14,690
Good luck, dude.

391
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,205
Grab me a cupcake.

392
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:22,183
Ted? You still with us?

393
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,668
Tell me your last name.

394
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,060
You know there's one little flaw in our plan.

395
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,105
What's that?

396
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,031
I'm going to go home tonight with a lot of great memories

397
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,328
and one really sucky memory.

398
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,280
The memory of you walking out that door.

399
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,630
Hey, Ted.

400
00:19:58,158 --> 00:19:59,043
Yeah?

401
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:01,895
Close your eyes...

402
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,512
and count to five.

403
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:09,183
One...

404
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:10,953
two...

405
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,127
three...

406
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,758
four...

407
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,157
five.

408
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:36,895
And to our dying days we'll remember everything about that night as perfect.

409
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,464
Maybe we both need that.

410
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,103
I mean, so many things go wrong in life

411
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,183
but this is the one thing that never will.

412
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,055
It will always...

413
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:50,633
always be pure unadulterated awesome.

414
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,321
And if I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us...

415
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:57,276
The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.

416
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:58,383
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

417
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:24,536
Oh, thank God.

1
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,173
When you meet someone special,

2
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,151
suddenly life is full of firsts.

3
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:18,551
The first kiss.

4
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:20,205
The first night together.

5
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,173
The first weekend together.

6
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:27,720
For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.

7
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,052
They have to come out soon, it's Monday.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,601
Do you think they've been in there the whole time?

9
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,636
I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.

10
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,067
Maybe they're not even in there.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,972
Good morning.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,143
Hey, guys.

13
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:45,657
I'm just going to ignore that.

14
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:46,826
Thank you!

15
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,570
I wish you could stay.

16
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:49,804
I know, me, too.

17
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,834
But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.

18
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,721
Call you afterwards?

19
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,156
I'll inappropriately text you during.

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,915
- Bye.
- Bye.

21
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:58,683
Bye.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,946
Oh, Victoria, you're here...

23
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,076
Toot-a-loo!

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,244
Bye.

25
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,224
Two days straight?!

26
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,915
Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,947
Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight,

28
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:12,361
but I know my boy got to double digits.

29
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,344
Zero.

30
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:14,214
- What?
- What?

31
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:15,976
Guys, we just met.

32
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:18,752
And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick,

33
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:21,256
so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.

34
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:23,324
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!

35
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,842
But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl,

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,043
and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.

37
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,159
I don't feel so good.

38
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:37,287
It's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.

39
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:39,722
I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month.

40
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,338
I would never put up with that.

41
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,075
You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life.

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,179
Burn!

43
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,869
Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.

44
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,546
Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night.

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,613
Who's up for hanging out?

46
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,822
Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.

47
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,898
No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.

48
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,818
Wow, nine years?

49
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,338
Your relationship's a fourth grader.

50
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:04,233
Congrats.

51
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,411
Thanks.

52
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:08,511
We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,317
It's one of New York Magazine's "Top five romantic getaways on a budget."

54
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,382
Who says sexual can't be sensible?

55
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,166
Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.

56
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:19,527
Really?

57
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,626
Actually, I was talking to my martini.

58
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:26,919
Ready to go?

59
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,063
Hell, yeah.

60
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,944
Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.

61
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,635
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M.

62
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,939
Sharp.

63
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,082
Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.

64
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:43,362
Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.

65
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,505
Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.

66
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,373
And it's supposed to rain tonight.

67
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,786
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV.

68
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,814
- Order in some Chinese.
- Oh, Sichuan Garden!

69
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,686
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell, yeah.

70
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,137
Good, cause this thing's empty.

71
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:12,503
Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say "wow."

72
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:16,591
Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.

73
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,968
It's one of the many risks of the blind approach.

74
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:22,679
It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot.

75
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:26,046
But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.

76
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,874
Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?

77
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,248
You can't just...

78
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:32,832
Wow!

79
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:33,968
Hey?

80
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,824
What's taking so long?

81
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:36,726
I have to go.

82
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,207
Not so fast, Scherbotsky.

83
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,986
I like the way you think.

84
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,695
That mirror thing.

85
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,975
Simple. Elegant.

86
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,559
Okay, limited-time offer:

87
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:50,159
I need a "bro" for my bro-ings on about town.

88
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:53,192
How would you like to be said bro?

89
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:57,482
Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped.

90
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,529
She really needs some support...

91
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:03,312
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.

92
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,994
That seems healthy.

93
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:06,931
All right.

94
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,093
Guess I'm in.

95
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:15,120
So... one more week and it'll be a month.

96
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,766
Really? Are you sure?

97
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:19,454
Wow, that snuck up on me.

98
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,820
Oh, come on.

99
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:23,586
The 18th can't get here fast enough.

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,319
Wait, the 18th?

101
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:29,653
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this-- I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!

102
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,906
O h.

103
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:35,018
Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back.

104
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:37,104
I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.

105
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,749
Yeah.

106
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:40,152
Or we could do it tonight.

107
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,084
75th and Amsterdam.

108
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,651
I'm  so glad we decided to just stay home.

109
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,467
Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?

110
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:54,894
We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.

111
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,659
And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex.

112
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:00,235
Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it.

113
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,528
I would like to propose a toast.

114
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:09,889
To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.

115
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,192
I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.

116
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,464
I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.

117
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,391
Oh, my God, what are they doing home?

118
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,249
They think we went away.

119
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:33,853
Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.

120
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,627
But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.

121
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:37,897
They don't know that.

122
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:42,645
All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.

123
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,119
But I don't want to hide out in here.

124
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,691
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this.

125
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,090
If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen.

126
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,625
Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted, and...

127
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,131
not going to be me.

128
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,682
Okay, fine.

129
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,588
I guess I'll actually floss.

130
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,014
You suited up!

131
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,544
Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.

132
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,734
Emilio? The woman will have...

133
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:20,298
I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2

134
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,285
Thanks.

135
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:25,341
Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. "The Torpedo."

136
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:28,271
Or, as the rollers call it, "Piramide."

137
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,713
My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.

138
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,182
Father issues.

139
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:36,297
Hot.

140
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,015
I know-- I was this close to being a huge slut.

141
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,002
Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro.

142
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,286
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink.

143
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:48,550
Because he's pregnant.

144
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,932
Cause he's the girl.

145
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,503
Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant.

146
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,937
You need to have sex to get pregnant.

147
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,473
What up!

148
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,947
Freeze frame high five!

149
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,832
I think this may be a perfect moment.

150
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,713
I wish we could hold onto it forever.

151
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,873
No.

152
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:15,142
Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting.

153
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,154
By its very nature, it...

154
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,465
slips through our fingers...

155
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:22,337
making it that much more precious.

156
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,475
Ugh, that is bad.

157
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:31,115
That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.

158
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,995
And they're not even high.

159
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:35,320
It's actually working.

160
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,815
Yeah, smooth but slowly.

161
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,898
God, close the deal, already.

162
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,781
It's been, like, 45 minutes-- we could have had sex three times by now.

163
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,687
- Yeah, try five.
- What up!

164
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,778
Maybe we should just go out there.

165
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,462
No way! We can't go out there now.

166
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:54,459
They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time.

167
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,062
It'll be too weird.

168
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,079
Fine.

169
00:07:58,202 --> 00:07:59,755
But if we're stuck in here...

170
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,273
I'm turning up the volume.

171
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,760
Shh. Shh.

172
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,214
I want to know you.

173
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,890
Like, know your soul.

174
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,303
Ted, what makes you cry?

175
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,207
Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.

176
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:27,215
So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?

177
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:28,885
Are you kidding?

178
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,534
Ted's never been here.

179
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,771
You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did.

180
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:35,482
Still...

181
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:36,592
What?

182
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,330
There is one other thing we could do.

183
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,515
If you're up for it.

184
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:51,117
Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!

185
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,157
Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again.

186
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,086
I give it two months.

187
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,298
Oh, I believe it-- this is awesome!

188
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,464
Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a...

189
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,033
Scherbotsky, you have to focus!

190
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:04,929
You just saved my life, didn't you?

191
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:06,218
Thank me later.

192
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,557
Let's keep moving.

193
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,313
These little bastards are everywhere.

194
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:17,259
He's just staring into her eyes.

195
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:22,723
I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria.

196
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:24,206
Now look at us.

197
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,523
Yeah...  now we just make fun of people like that.

198
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:29,504
It's the circle of life.

199
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,527
No, I'm serious, Marshall.

200
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,677
I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip.

201
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:39,139
And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.

202
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:42,238
Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria.

203
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,140
This  is their first time.

204
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,332
Yeah, but we could still have some more romance.

205
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:50,273
Now, you just say, "Want to do it?" And I say, "Yeah."

206
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,142
- Want to...
- No!

207
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,268
Maybe we're just out of firsts.

208
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,645
Looks like they're about to have theirs.

209
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:19,211
Should we take this to the bedroom?

210
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,433
- Yes!
- Yes!

211
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,586
Yes.

212
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:23,956
- Yes!
- Yes!

213
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,057
No. No, don't answer it!

214
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:32,780
You can answer it.

215
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:34,021
We have all night.

216
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,229
You're answering it? He's answering it!

217
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:38,696
No! Do her! Do her now!

218
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,895
Sure. Good luck with that.

219
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,521
Sorry about that.

220
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,123
How about a little more wine?

221
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:48,976
I'll get another bottle.

222
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,426
I need a drink.

223
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,653
Do we have any cough syrup in here?

224
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,182
Shh...

225
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,719
Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded.

226
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,021
I counted nine, maybe ten.

227
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,048
I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.

228
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:13,560
No. Leave no man behind.

229
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,444
Either we all get out of here or no one does.

230
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,818
- But I...
- Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.

231
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,182
See you on the other side.

232
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:33,119
Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?

233
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:34,226
- Yeah.
- All right.

234
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,275
Marshall, what happened to us?

235
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:43,327
We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long.

236
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,218
Have we lost that?

237
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:47,805
Maybe.

238
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:53,764
But I think I just found it.

239
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:56,084
Right here.

240
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:03,849
Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.

241
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:10,584
Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision.

242
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,116
Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning?

243
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,340
- Oh, damn it.
- It's all right. We can do this.

244
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,830
Let's just hold hands.

245
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,067
This is nice.

246
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,621
You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.

247
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:38,668
All right, we totally suck at this.

248
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:41,732
We really, really need to get out of here.

249
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:43,343
Well, we can't.

250
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,380
Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you,

251
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,131
it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.

252
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,338
What is it?

253
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:54,653
I have to pee.

254
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,240
- This is bad.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:04,303
We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other.

256
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,162
You always think there'll be more time.

257
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:09,071
Look at us.

258
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:13,087
We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet.

259
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:17,421
The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it,

260
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,470
it might go out forever.

261
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,852
How much longer do you think you can hold it?

262
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:26,035
I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.

263
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:28,478
Oh,  boy.

264
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,084
Playing laser tag really takes me back.

265
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,313
You know what game I really miss? Battleship.

266
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,534
I've never lost a game.

267
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,925
Neither have I.

268
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:40,767
Of course I cheat.

269
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:41,958
Oh, yeah, me, too.

270
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:44,657
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.

271
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,255
Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.

272
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,221
Nice.

273
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,461
You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match.

274
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,379
I think I still have a...

275
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:55,655
Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.

276
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:58,228
Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky.

277
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,923
I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.

278
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,815
That's a woman.

279
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,704
Oh, my mistake.

280
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,618
Or is it?

281
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:10,551
Let's just focus on your target.

282
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,626
Right.

283
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,588
Yeah, I got this one.

284
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,317
Oh, my God. I love your jeans.

285
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,960
Okay. Is this a lesbian bar?

286
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,451
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...

287
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:29,356
Oh, no. I am all about the dudes.

288
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:31,347
Although pickings are pretty slim tonight.

289
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,686
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.

290
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:39,749
Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now.

291
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,119
Must be the jeans.

292
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,365
Well, jeans will only get you so far.

293
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:47,889
I'm going home with him.

294
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:50,747
We'll see about that.

295
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,002
Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.

296
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,096
Baby, why don't you just go?

297
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:10,332
Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.

298
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:14,690
No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.

299
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,136
Well, you have farted in front of me.

300
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,388
Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.

301
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,806
You always do.

302
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,975
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:32,190
Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.

304
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:33,166
What happened?

305
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,402
Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.

306
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:37,984
But why?

307
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,441
Leave no man behind.

308
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,132
Either we all score or no one scores.

309
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,037
Right on.

310
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,285
Hey, you want to go play Battleship?

311
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,453
Hit!

312
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,224
Ted, I can't wait any longer.

313
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,816
Should we move to the bedroom?

314
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,548
There's no time for that.

315
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,382
They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour,

316
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,875
but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?

317
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,499
Baby, I can't hold it in any longer.

318
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,926
It's time.

319
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,493
I know.

320
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,869
I love you, Marshall.

321
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,597
I love you, Lily.

322
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,315
You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly good time bro-ing out tonight.

323
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:40,731
Well, you make a good bro.

324
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:42,735
You're a better Ted than Ted.

325
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:47,543
Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.

326
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,364
And you don't even have to come out of the cake.

327
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:50,480
Thanks.

328
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:54,287
And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight.

329
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,169
I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship.

330
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:58,024
Come on, boys.

331
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,462
Hard-core?

332
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:03,978
That's the only way I play.

333
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,684
I found it. Are you ready to...

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,817
What the hell are you doing?

335
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,113
I'm birthday suiting up.

336
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:20,906
I'm sorry, did you want to undress me?

337
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,669
No!  I thought we were just hanging out as friends.

338
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,108
Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.

339
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:30,277
What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.

340
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:34,091
You invited me up to your apartment to "play Battleship."

341
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:37,163
Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex?

342
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,312
No.

343
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:40,900
Great.

344
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,654
I hope you're happy.

345
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,591
You sunk my battleship.

346
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,383
I'm okay.

347
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:51,792
You okay?

348
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:55,935
I feel the same.

349
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,635
And yet, strangely different.

350
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:04,889
I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.

351
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:09,126
You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted.

352
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:12,935
And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.

353
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,630
Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit

354
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,513
so a new one out there could blossom.

355
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,976
Oh, crap!

356
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,897
They must have heard that.

357
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:30,696
Well, I guess we can come out now.

358
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,679
I don't believe it. They're gone.

359
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,103
Good.

360
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:46,078
'Cause I got to take a whiz.

361
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:51,837
Okay, you and me, that's insane.

362
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,410
If you even thought about it for one second...

363
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,390
But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense.

364
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:58,548
We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag.

365
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,466
We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.

366
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,292
Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense.

367
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,881
But what about Ted?

368
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,763
I checked with Ted.

369
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,287
Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well,

370
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,191
I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right?

371
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:18,599
I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin,

372
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,902
you'd be cool with that, right?

373
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,831
Sure. Good luck with that.

374
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,356
Totally gave us his blessing.

375
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:25,419
Really?

376
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,172
Really.

377
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:30,887
So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?

378
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,939
Didn't care at all.

379
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:38,789
Oh.

380
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:40,870
Oh...

381
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,760
What?

382
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,597
You like Ted.

383
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:44,828
I didn't say I liked Ted.

384
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:47,437
You like Ted.

385
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:48,793
Wow.

386
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,239
This is huge.

387
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,214
Barney, I don't like Ted.

388
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,977
He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...

389
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,267
Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?

390
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,992
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

391
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:11,665
No.

392
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,277
That's the bro code.

393
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:19,536
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him.

394
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,396
Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro

395
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,512
that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her.

396
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,335
It's quid pro bro.

397
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,633
- A-7.
- Miss.

398
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:32,882
Of course.

399
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,563
Well, we still have one frontier left.

400
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,579
Still got the deuce.

401
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,590
Not making me feel better.

402
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,041
Well, it certainly was a first.

403
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:51,344
It was, wasn't it?

404
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,859
We still have firsts.

405
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:55,800
Of course we do.

406
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:58,551
And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now.

407
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,086
I want to know you.

408
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,204
Like, know your soul.

409
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,522
Marshall, what makes you cry?

410
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:18,520
This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.

411
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,127
Oh, just grab my boob already.

412
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,454
Come on, guys, get a room.

1
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,439
Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,548
is that he's always been good at games.

3
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:10,077
I mean, unbeatable.

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,101
Gin!

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,717
Yahtzee!

6
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:16,741
Poker!

7
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:20,004
You don't have to shout out "poker" when you win.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,970
I know. It's just fun to say.

9
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:25,273
We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights

10
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,820
instead of playing in them.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,990
Which he took to mean, "invent your own game."

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,033
It's called "Marsh-gammon."

13
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,596
It combines all the best features of all the best games--

14
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:38,012
Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.

15
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:39,253
Backgammon, obviously.

16
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:41,349
No. Backgammon sucks.

17
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,868
I took the only good part of backgammon, the "gammon,"

18
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,855
and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.

19
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:50,253
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

20
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:51,924
I'm going to go get another round.

21
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,511
Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight.

22
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,579
Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot,

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,608
so don't say anything embarrass...

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,034
Don't say anything.

25
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:06,783
And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin,

26
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:11,352
- so we you could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well. How rich.

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,869
You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend,

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,895
yet, you have been lying to her since day one.

29
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,251
Excuse me.

30
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,778
Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on.

31
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:26,001
So, nothing for him to stand on?

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,386
Okay, and thanks so much.

33
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:33,094
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin?

34
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:37,594
I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.

35
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:40,343
No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.

36
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:44,523
Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?

37
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,173
Nothing. It's nothing.

38
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:49,981
And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?

39
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:52,592
Us? What would we do?

40
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:56,063
Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have

41
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,244
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

42
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:03,247
However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?

43
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:04,924
- Fine.
- Fine.

44
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,010
Thank you.

45
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,006
I should go help Robin.

46
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,169
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,968
So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?

48
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh, sure. She's great.

49
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,227
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted?

50
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,934
No. Victoria's great.

51
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,941
She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great.

52
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,497
I said, "She's great" too many times, didn't I?

53
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,339
You must really hate the bitch.

54
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:35,932
But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

55
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,165
then you "Marshall out," and all your chips go into the pot,

56
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:44,204
and remember, if you ever ask the question "What?", then...

57
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,902
you got to drink. Got it?

58
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,716
Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up.

59
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:53,621
Newbie goes first. Roll.

60
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:54,764
Okay.

61
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,651
Three!

62
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,996
You got Autobiography.

63
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,438
Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question

64
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,421
about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.

65
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:05,432
Marshall, come on.

66
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:08,181
Hey, she's the one who rolled a three.

67
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:14,812
Victoria, "Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"

68
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,613
Wow, good question.

69
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,416
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

70
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:23,749
Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college,

71
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,459
and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night,

72
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,983
and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.

73
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,672
Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer.

74
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,777
You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.

75
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,277
So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?

76
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:45,194
What?

77
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:46,854
You said what, you got to drink!

78
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:52,664
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd,

79
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,463
and the host said she knew you.

80
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,765
What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?

81
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,055
Shannon?!

82
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,157
Shannon, Shannon...

83
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:03,301
No, don't remember any Shannon.

84
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,969
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...

85
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,295
Where's the tape?

86
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,638
Fine. I'll go get it.

87
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,944
Cool, okay. You know, whenever.

88
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:17,190
Okay, Robin, your roll.

89
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:22,660
Five! Another Autobiography...

90
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:25,266
for the player to your left, which...

91
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,835
Victoria!

92
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,507
Of course.

93
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:34,759
Victoria, "How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?"

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,666
Wait, the card actually says "Ted?"

95
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,602
Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.

96
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:41,891
Prude alert.

97
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:45,911
Well... that's serious boyfriends.

98
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,602
I've dated other guys in between.

99
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,941
Oh, slut alert!

100
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,751
Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach.

101
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,687
Oh, wow, look at that.

102
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:09,654
Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.

103
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:12,846
Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.

104
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:16,208
Barney, what was on that tape?

105
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,578
Too bad you'll never find out.

106
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,808
Oh, damn it!

107
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:23,377
If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse.

108
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:25,653
Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.

109
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,444
What?!

110
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,388
Drink!

111
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:33,032
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.

112
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,440
So, should we pop it in?

113
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:36,293
- Give it to me, give it, give me...
- Play the tape, play it, play it!

114
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,687
- Ted!
- Fine, fine.

115
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:41,218
You cannot play it.

116
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,943
Shannon!

117
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,700
I love you!

118
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,469
I love you so much.

119
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:55,200
What about us changing the world together?

120
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,699
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

121
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,601
I know I haven't.

122
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:08,326
Will I ever see another rainbow?

123
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:14,872
Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe?

124
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,875
Baby, please

125
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:20,159
Don't go

126
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,695
There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love

127
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,818
There's a thief in the palace and she's...

128
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,337
Did you try his cell phone?

129
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:38,793
Yeah, I left two messages.

130
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:41,020
I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard.

131
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,610
He's off the grid.

132
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,438
Hey, guys, what up?

133
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,783
Barney, where have you been?

134
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,746
Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.

135
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,910
Yeah, so sorry.

136
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:53,965
But seriously, what was up with the tape?

137
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,392
- No, no, stay.
- Come on, Barney.

138
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,538
- Come on.
- Stay!

139
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:57,695
I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it.

140
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,273
It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.

141
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,283
Well, we all have embarrassing stories.

142
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,062
Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.

143
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:06,239
Oh, really?

144
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,520
Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall?

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,723
Show me how good it is.

146
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,137
All right.

147
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:18,755
I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi,

148
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,721
but they were all at recess.

149
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:23,910
I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom.

150
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,658
It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down.

151
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:35,689
What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom.

152
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,820
I wish I'd pulled up my pants.

153
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,690
The kids still call him Funny Butt.

154
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:55,834
Okay. I'll tell you my story.

155
00:07:56,135 --> 00:08:00,740
Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.

156
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,829
It was 1998.

157
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,801
I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend.

158
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:09,383
My girlfriend... Shannon.

159
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,738
Yeah, you were meant for me

160
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:16,194
And I was meant for you

161
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,883
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

162
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,843
Thank you.

163
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,813
All right.

164
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,793
I love your singing, Barney.

165
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:30,013
And I love you, Shannon.

166
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,008
Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.

167
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,069
I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.

168
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:40,780
Hey, nonfat latte to go.

169
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,998
Mellow order, bro, mellow order.

170
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,976
Dude, that your g-friend?

171
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,634
All right, high five!

172
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,377
Sorry, I only give high twos.

173
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,632
Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.

174
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,739
Listen to you.

175
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,886
That?

176
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,473
You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings.

177
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,616
And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married.

178
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,648
You can read about it in my zine.

179
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:08,901
Hey, haircut, right here.

180
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,075
Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes.

181
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,386
Forget that touchy-feely crap.

182
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:15,056
You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.

183
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,075
I feel sorry for you, man.

184
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,114
Peace out, hombre.

185
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,644
Suits.

186
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:27,646
Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps.

187
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,386
Only problem was...

188
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,036
she never showed up.

189
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,388
She never showed?

190
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,357
So, what happened next?

191
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:43,312
You know what? This was a mistake.

192
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:47,390
Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?

193
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,337
Oh, I know just how to decide who.

194
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,816
You brought the game to the bar?

195
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,809
Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.

196
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,157
I was winning?

197
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,186
Fine. I'll go next.

198
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:05,782
I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.

199
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:08,177
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!

200
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,693
Yeah, we all know that one.

201
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,356
Okay, how about this?

202
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,044
I will tell you my most humiliating story.

203
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,352
Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!

204
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:19,389
Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare,

205
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,475
a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping,

206
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:25,708
and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.

207
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,697
Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories,

208
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,188
but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one.

209
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:33,233
Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.

210
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:37,636
That is the greatest story ever!

211
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,757
- Oh my God!
- Wow, wow!

212
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,198
Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy.

213
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,644
My saga... continues.

214
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,175
I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.

215
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:54,169
Barney.

216
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,852
Sugar Bear, where were you?

217
00:10:55,853 --> 00:11:00,116
Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.

218
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,700
But the Nicaraguans need us!

219
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,822
It's just, he's still supporting me, and...

220
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,724
Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but

221
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,917
I think you should go on without me.

222
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:11,921
Shannon, there is no...

223
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,821
Barney, it's your dream.

224
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:16,965
It's only two years.

225
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,000
I know we can make it.

226
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:25,565
As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult.

227
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,020
Her father couldn't control her life.

228
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,622
I had to go back and confront him.

229
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,762
She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.

230
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,713
What?!

231
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:50,692
Now we all got to drink.

232
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,301
Oh, my God. What happened next?

233
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,802
I don't know, guys.

234
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,376
Okay, okay.

235
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:07,234
- Marshall's mom sent us cookies...
- Lily, no!

236
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,540
For the team, Marshall, for the team.

237
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,841
Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily.

238
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,444
Thank you so much for the delicious cookies.

239
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:17,672
Mayonnaise.

240
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:18,904
Really?

241
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:20,732
Never would have guessed.

242
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,030
Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you.

243
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:25,828
Okay. Take care.

244
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:29,426
Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?

245
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,848
Yeah.

246
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,272
I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.

247
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,666
So we've got the whole place to ourselves.

248
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,222
I'm thinking floor sex.

249
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,815
Sounds reasonable.

250
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,453
Ooh, floor's cold.

251
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,055
Grab that afghan your mom made.

252
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,412
The whole time?

253
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:56,043
The... whole... time.

254
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,339
Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us.

255
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,676
We just earned a huge chunk of story.

256
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:02,567
Right.

257
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,120
So where was I?

258
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:07,662
Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.

259
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,527
How can... With your dad?

260
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:23,024
I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!

261
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,207
Barney, that's not my dad.

262
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,579
His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks.

263
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,363
I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.

264
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,579
We're breaking up?

265
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,275
But what about the Peace Corps?

266
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:39,108
Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase.

267
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,874
Greg's older.

268
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,436
He's successful.

269
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:45,217
He buys me all this cool stuff.

270
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,712
But I love you.

271
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,813
But he has a boat.

272
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:55,891
You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.

273
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,544
I didn't go.

274
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,820
That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon.

275
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,534
I didn't see her until a week later.

276
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,909
There's sugar in the basket.

277
00:14:12,256 --> 00:14:15,024
Shannon! Shannon, you came back!

278
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,143
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.

279
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:21,937
Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?

280
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:23,863
Oh, she got the tape.

281
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,751
You?

282
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:28,573
It was you?

283
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:32,466
Will I ever see another rainbow

284
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,595
Oh, man.

285
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,820
Oh, you poor thing.

286
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,320
The story's not over.

287
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,509
I did see Shannon one more time.

288
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,474
When?

289
00:15:58,475 --> 00:15:59,205
Sorry.

290
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,443
Sorry.

291
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,023
You've got to tell us.

292
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:09,221
I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.

293
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:11,958
Fine.

294
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,294
Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college

295
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:19,053
and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...

296
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:22,592
Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear.

297
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,539
Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth.

298
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,961
Why can't you?

299
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:29,379
You're right.

300
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,948
Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet,

301
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:37,610
but a while back, I was kind of into Robin.

302
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:42,817
In fact, on our first date, I might have said, "I love you."

303
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,692
Understandably, she freaked out and I left.

304
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:51,011
But unfortunately, the night did not end there.

305
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,926
We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.

306
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,833
To one hell of a night!

307
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,956
And I drank... a lot.

308
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:09,215
So you guys think I should have kissed her?

309
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:14,966
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.

310
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,011
Yes! Do it!

311
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:18,499
To the cab.

312
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,627
Hello?

313
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,037
Is someone out there?

314
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:51,127
You ralphed and ran?

315
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,442
I thought you were vomit-free since '93.

316
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,085
So that was a lie?

317
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:59,536
You re-returned for me.

318
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,484
That's really sweet.

319
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,203
Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.

320
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,167
Sorry.

321
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,430
It's okay.

322
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,063
Victoria, I know this must be...

323
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:13,504
Yeah. It kind of is.

324
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,668
Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story.

325
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,700
But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine.

326
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,433
We fast-forward eight years into the future.

327
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,681
Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.

328
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:33,441
Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.

329
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,243
Hi.

330
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,014
Barney?

331
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:48,394
Hi, Shannon.

332
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,149
- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.

333
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,014
When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me.

334
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,528
Now I'm this.

335
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:02,623
I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life.

336
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,191
And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now.

337
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:08,128
So here I am.

338
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,593
And then she told me about her life.

339
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:15,055
She and Greg dated for a while and then split up.

340
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,871
But here's the real kicker:

341
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,678
Shannon's a mom.

342
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,073
She has a little kid named Max.

343
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,859
That's crazy.

344
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,335
That could have been my kid.

345
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:28,257
But instead, what do I have?

346
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,885
My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet

347
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:35,428
and a string of one-night stands.

348
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,765
Hey. Come on.

349
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:41,457
I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another,

350
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,146
it doesn't make your life any worse.

351
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,701
My life rocks!

352
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,423
Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy!

353
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:57,540
I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers.

354
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,572
But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365!

355
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,441
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.

356
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,854
Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry

357
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,818
on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life.

358
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,956
After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.

359
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:15,858
- Nope.
- Yeah.

360
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,694
- Nope.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:19,433
Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up.

362
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,566
You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had

363
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,470
a profound moment of doubt about yourself and...

364
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,062
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Barney!

365
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:29,423
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?

366
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:30,732
Is your phone on?

367
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,152
Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.

368
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,016
Ew, gross. Just stop it.

369
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:40,816
Ladies, gentlemen... Ted.

370
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,725
This has been a wonderful evening.

371
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,435
I got great dirt on all you guys.

372
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,586
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

373
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,511
I finally nailed Shannon!

374
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:52,061
Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right.

375
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:56,216
And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is.

376
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:57,951
Peace out, hombres!

377
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,436
I think Barney just won game night.

378
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,889
We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,

379
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,996
even from our closest friends.

380
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,549
But those rare times when we do open up,

381
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,205
it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming.

382
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,222
Of course, not every secret was told that night.

383
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:33,762
But that's getting ahead of the story.

384

1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,508
Kids, when it comes to love,

2
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,671
the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.

3
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:20,510
My first solo batch.

4
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,664
Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer.

5
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,012
Here's a professional tip.

6
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:28,172
If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake.

7
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:29,461
It's a beverage.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,862
Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun,

9
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:34,748
and easy, and uncomplicated.

10
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,258
It was pretty great.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,050
Um, are you coloring in your butt?

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,603
I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it.

13
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:51,266
I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so,

14
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,878
yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,860
So wear another one.

16
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:55,884
I don't have another one.

17
00:00:55,885 --> 00:01:00,140
I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.

18
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,935
Dude, you show up to an interview in that,

19
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:05,956
even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals

20
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,890
will hackey sack you straight out the door.

21
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,254
Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job.

22
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:15,175
Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid.

23
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,553
Mostly getting people coffee.

24
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,714
But the people I'm getting coffee for--

25
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:21,553
their bosses are going to save the world.

26
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:25,685
Okay, tomorrow-- oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world--

27
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:30,073
tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.

28
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:30,960
A tailor?

29
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,447
Barney, I make negative $300 a week,

30
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:35,879
and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,204
Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost.

32
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:43,840
And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit."

33
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:47,373
Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.

34
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:49,724
No thanks, dude.

35
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,050
- Noon?
- Noon. See you then.

36
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,393
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

37
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,038
Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted.

38
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,369
It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.

39
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,886
Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.

40
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:08,983
Robin!

41
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:10,807
Oh, come on. We bust on each other.

42
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:13,105
We're just at that place in our strong friendship.

43
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:15,320
Really? Oh.

44
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,547
Get off me.

45
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:19,281
Oh, see? I did it again.

46
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,598
What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping.

47
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,016
You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops.

48
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:28,729
If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,035
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,673
Huh. I should take this.

51
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,482
Hello.

52
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,585
Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow.

53
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,785
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?

54
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:45,436
Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing.

55
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:47,653
You had your chance, and now he's moved on.

56
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,993
Can't you just be happy for them?

57
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,299
The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.

58
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,476
Sold.

59
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,344
Victoria, what's wrong?

60
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,997
I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.

61
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,164
Wait. Germany, Europe?

62
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:07,870
It's for two years.

63
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,349
I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but...

64
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,689
I'm in.

65
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:16,027
So, this is the Europe Germany?

66
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,511
What other Germany would it be?

67
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,364
- The one in Epcot?
- Ted.

68
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:21,428
Sorry.

69
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,658
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:27,387
I don't know if I'm going to go.

71
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:30,689
Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?

72
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,123
I don't know.

73
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:36,998
I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.

74
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,137
Oh, God, no.

75
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:42,844
Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.

76
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:46,357
So, that leaves us with...

77
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,620
Either you stay here,

78
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,408
or we break up.

79
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,228
Wow.

80
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:57,097
Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September,

81
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,079
- we still feel...
- I have to leave on Monday.

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,616
- Monday, September the...?
- Ted.

83
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:06,088
Do you have any thoughts?

84
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,706
Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want.

85
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:12,500
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.

86
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,397
It's a date.

87
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,451
And that's when things got complicated.

88
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,897
Hey, baby, how's the dress place?

89
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:23,104
Everything's so fluffy and white.

90
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,939
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.

91
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,805
How's Barney's tailor?

92
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:32,520
Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.

93
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,467
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

94
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,755
- Well, good luck, baby.
- Bye.

95
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:41,250
Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this.

96
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,652
A tailor in the back room of a pet store?

97
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:46,802
Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not?

98
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,237
Ted, Sergei says stop moping around.

99
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,116
You're distracting him from his process.

100
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:57,667
You speak Ukrainian?

101
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,522
Guys, I'm kind of screwed here.

102
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:05,501
I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me.

103
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,471
And long distance definitely isn't an option.

104
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,561
No. No, no, no. No way.

105
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:11,571
You know who likes long distance? Girls.

106
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,528
It's all talking and no sex. Kill me now.

107
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:18,607
Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.

108
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,531
- Really? You?
- Absolutely.

109
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,217
I'm juggling four right now.

110
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:25,390
There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo,

111
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,435
there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street.

112
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,863
The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.

113
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:38,636
Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?

114
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:39,158
Yeah.

115
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,566
Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel.

116
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,799
So, I went out to visit, and there was this party.

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,627
And who shows up but Gabriel.

118
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:50,081
And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache.

119
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,370
I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude.

120
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,798
So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet,

121
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,894
I got the crazy eyes going, and I said,

122
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,827
"You stay away from Lily,

123
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:09,133
or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."

124
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,059
Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away.

125
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,744
I think he was crying.

126
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,692
I never told Lily about it.

127
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,244
To be honest, I'm not very proud of it.

128
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:21,045
To be even more honest, I am.

129
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,879
Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans,

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,405
did that little story have a point?

131
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,568
Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate,

132
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,783
long distance still almost killed us.

133
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:35,284
If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate,

134
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,722
you should ask her to stay.

135
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,675
Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.

136
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,724
Oh, please. You barely know this girl.

137
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:42,776
What's her favorite color?

138
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,591
Is she a cat person or a dog person?

139
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,584
Is she open to a three-way?

140
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:49,442
Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone.

141
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,844
And FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.

142
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:57,927
Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.

143
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,619
Are you sure?

144
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,682
All right.

145
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,143
Hello.

146
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,477
Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,357
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

148
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:13,371
Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.

149
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,074
She's a cat person.

150
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,993
I don't know this girl at all.

151
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,060
- Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
- Yes.

152
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:25,342
Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?

153
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:28,040
Here. Play with this pin cushion.

154
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,518
God.

155
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,634
I'm going to look hot.

156
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,239
Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice

157
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,812
fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival.

158
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,239
This is a suit for winners.

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,471
I am getting you an interview at my office.

160
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,547
We need good men like you in our legal department.

161
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:52,442
We get sued a lot.

162
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,047
No way. The Kid does not sell out.

163
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,645
Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me,

164
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,238
you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.

165
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,388
No. I've made my decision.

166
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,103
So have I.

167
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:08,252
If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out,

168
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,801
I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time.

169
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:13,754
It's just too much pressure on a new relationship.

170
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,746
I'm going to tell her to go.

171
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:21,328
And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.

172
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,818
All right, I've been thinking a lot about this...

173
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,961
Okay, wait, before you say anything,

174
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:29,925
I wanted to give you this.

175
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:35,300
This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.

176
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,728
I want you to stay.

177
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:52,917
Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.

178
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,894
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

179
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,270
- Oh, good luck, baby.
- Bye.

180
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,854
Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?

181
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:03,090
Nothing too huge or-or poofy.

182
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,619
I'm not really a girlie girl.

183
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,540
But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.

184
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,254
I saw a couple up front that were nice.

185
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,876
By the window?

186
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:15,490
No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range.

187
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,837
Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.

188
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,312
Oh, these women are experts.

189
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:24,686
They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.

190
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:29,039
Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!

191
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,816
At least we get free champagne!

192
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,278
- And cake.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,701
Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided

194
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:37,151
what to do about your doughnut fellowship?

195
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,089
You know, I don't know.

196
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,622
I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.

197
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,051
I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.

198
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,584
Ugh. All talking and no sex. Kill me now.

199
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,908
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One.

200
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:55,102
That's pretty hard to walk away from.

201
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:56,286
Well, I don't know.

202
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:59,090
I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity

203
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,376
to chase some guy I'd only known two months.

204
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:03,453
But this isn't just some guy.

205
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,059
This is Ted.

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,077
He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.

207
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,329
Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew!

208
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,555
I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.

209
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,744
- I really don't...
- Sex.

210
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,779
Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.

211
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,969
Thanks.

212
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,672
- Oh!
- Oh!

213
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,542
It's okay, guys, I hate it.

214
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,602
- Just horrible.
- It's bad, it's really bad.

215
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,240
Short in front, long in the back?

216
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:35,423
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.

217
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,654
You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once.

218
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,716
In college, I did an art course in Paris.

219
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,752
I was the only American there.

220
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,341
It was really lonely.

221
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:49,173
I only had one friend, Gabrielle.

222
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,737
She was kind of homely and strange-looking,

223
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:55,576
and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had.

224
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:59,172
Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me,

225
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:01,388
and I never figured out why.

226
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,000
And then I had nobody.

227
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,007
The only thing that got me through was knowing

228
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:09,328
that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me.

229
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,979
If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.

230
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,025
But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates?

231
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:17,644
It's too soon.

232
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,938
Ooh. Speak of the devil.

233
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:20,701
Hello.

234
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,993
Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?

235
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:25,652
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

236
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:29,036
A cat person. Why am I not surprised?

237
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:31,321
Bye.

238
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,750
Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?

239
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,783
Maybe he's going to buy you one.

240
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,243
I did hear barking in the background.

241
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,919
Maybe he was in a pet store.

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,086
Does he want us to get a cat together?

243
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:46,204
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.

244
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
That is low.

245
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,990
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

246
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,533
Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out.

247
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,974
I would be on the next plane to Germany.

248
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,780
- Aw.
- Aw.

249
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:00,005
Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.

250
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,608
- Ugly, ugly, ugly.
- I don't know what to say.

251
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,999
You know what? We're doing this all wrong.

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,712
I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.

253
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:14,504
Are you okay?

254
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,833
I'm fine.

255
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:16,948
Okay.

256
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:20,411
Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.

257
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,659
I'm not, I'm just trying to support her.

258
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,592
She got a super-important dessert scholarship.

259
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:29,878
Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship.

260
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,061
Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic.

261
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:36,946
Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan,

262
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:40,180
but she seems to make Ted happy.

263
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,504
So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.

264
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,940
Somebody say "beautiful princess."

265
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:50,182
Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh!

266
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:53,567
This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.

267
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:58,043
Oh, look how happy she is.

268
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,839
You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women

269
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,654
who would never let any guy mess with my career.

270
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,170
And now I'm actually thinking about it.

271
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:11,483
I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.

272
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,430
I know what you mean.

273
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,049
You do?

274
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:22,584
Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and...

275
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,314
to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.

276
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,571
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

277
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:33,889
Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist.

278
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,319
Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.

279
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,513
Robin...

280
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:45,042
I think that you are the coolest.

281
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,345
I'm so glad that we're friends.

282
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:48,882
Oh, no way-- you're the coolest.

283
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,994
No, you are.

284
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,643
Okay, I am.

285
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,595
I'm going to stay.

286
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,734
- Aw.
- Aw.

287
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,327
Oh, I am so beautiful!

288
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,721
Oh, don't tell me how much it costs.

289
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:13,832
Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.

290
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,350
Wow, you look incredible.

291
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:21,260
Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?

292
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,632
Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.

293
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:29,841
Well, it's okay.

294
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:32,543
You know, what makes a bride beautiful

295
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:36,074
is that she's just happy to be getting married.

296
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,574
Oh, guys, I know I look amazing,

297
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:46,067
but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?

298
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,220
Yes, you're right.

299
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,560
But also... you just sat down in the cake.

300
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:55,791
But, you know what?

301
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,746
It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.

302
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,871
Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.

303
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:14,015
It was like this when I found it?

304
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,502
And how will you be paying for this?

305
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:21,134
Credit card... s.

306
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:28,811
I wanted to give you... this.

307
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:31,124
This is what happens when you...

308
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,031
you know, let them finish baking.

309
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,544
I want you to stay.

310
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,112
I have to go to Germany.

311
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:53,242
You're going?

312
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,566
Yes. I have to.

313
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,994
So that's what you decided?

314
00:15:56,995 --> 00:16:00,081
Well, no-- I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying,

315
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:03,904
but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.

316
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:05,640
What is this, opposite day or something?

317
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,748
- No.
- So it is?

318
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,448
Ted, we've only been dating for two months.

319
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,974
I can't let you make this decision for me.

320
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,712
I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake,

321
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:18,838
and it reminded me how great you are.

322
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,584
Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?

323
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:23,604
Well, that's just crazy.

324
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:25,718
Oh, okay.

325
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,691
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.

326
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,159
But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.

327
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,918
You'd have me.

328
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,060
We've only been dating two months.

329
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,824
Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up.

330
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,433
I hate this.

331
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,581
So... we're breaking up?

332
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,400
I guess so.

333
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,234
I guess so.

334
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,411
God, that sucks, man.

335
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:00,164
I'm so sorry.

336
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,874
It was just too much pressure too soon.

337
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,387
I mean, maybe it was silly to even think...

338
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:09,173
Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.

339
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:11,010
Well, thank you for acknowledging it.

340
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:12,221
It was weird that you hadn't.

341
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:16,391
Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?

342
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:18,999
- She's leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah, but she's still in town.

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,104
Yeah, she... she's still in town.

344
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:24,697
Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together.

345
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,418
Ted, think about it this way:

346
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,802
if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow,

347
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:31,086
would you sit on the couch and cry about it,

348
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:33,428
or would you run, and jump,

349
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,177
and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?

350
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,079
Awesome air kicks, huh?

351
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,981
- New pajama bottoms?
- You know it.

352
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,338
So we can sit around and cry, or we can run,

353
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:52,781
and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.

354
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,262
Wait, so we're sharing the leg?

355
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:57,379
No, the leg is a metaphor.

356
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,637
How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day,

357
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,895
and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next?

358
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,172
I don't know, Ted.

359
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,690
Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?

360
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,379
Well, what would you want to do?

361
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,982
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.

362
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:15,855
Like go to the Mets.

363
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,349
Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.

364
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,159
See some monkeys at the zoo?

365
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,807
Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?

366
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,836
Wow! We better get going.

367
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,261
Yeah, big day.

368
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:26,831
Yeah.

369
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:30,391
And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day.

370
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:34,328
The museum, the bridge, the restaurant,

371
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:37,081
and all of those nice things.

372
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,187
Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.

373
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,274
No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up,

374
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:47,069
and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

375
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,902
Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.

376
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,917
Yeah, but only, like, second base.

377
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,320
Look at us: two guys in suits.

378
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:58,008
You feel that slight tingle?

379
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,876
That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you.

380
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,731
Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.

381
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,791
Hey, babe.

382
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:13,085
Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.

383
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,380
So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?

384
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:19,735
Oh, please-- your company is not called Barney Corp.

385
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,062
Yet.

386
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:24,109
Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.

387
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,838
B... Barney, this says $4,000.

388
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,289
I thought you said that it was one-third price.

389
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,096
Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit.

390
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:36,481
Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.

391
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,373
You set this up! You set this whole thing up!

392
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:43,828
I most certainly did...

393
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,263
Well, it won't work.

394
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:49,698
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor.

395
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm not selling my soul.

396
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:56,767
Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.

397
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:00,097
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

398
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,932
What time is the interview?

399
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,078
9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes.

400
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,031
Don't worry, I know a guy.

401
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:14,364
I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.

402
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:17,638
Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.

403
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:22,731
I'm going to miss you so much.

404
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,450
I'm going to miss you, too.

405
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:36,128
Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...

406
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,981
Even if we're not.

407
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,810
Okay.

408
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,597
Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?

409
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:04,999
Yes. Yes!

410
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,513
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.

411
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,953
It's gonna work.

412
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:14,621
We're going to make it work-- it'll work.

413
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,212
It didn't work.

414
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:20,768
Long-distance was and is a terrible idea,

415
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,616
a really terrible idea, just awful.

416
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,269
But more on that later.

1
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:15,957
When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old,

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,660
he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas.

3
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:23,617
It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,

4
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:28,863
and it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon.

5
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:33,750
When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture,

6
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:37,909
Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.

7
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,598
What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?

8
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,450
So you want to be an anthropologist?

9
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:47,110
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.

10
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,949
What she said next changed his life.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,090
Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,123
They'll all be dead by then.

13
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:01,087
...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

14
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:05,783
the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.

15
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:07,784
So you don't want coffee?

16
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:10,689
I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...

17
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,806
- All right. I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

18
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,226
The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.

19
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:18,521
I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us.

20
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,031
"The kid" has become "the man."

21
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,484
Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money.

22
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,154
After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC.

23
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,945
They're gonna stop global warming.

24
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:30,486
Well... I mean... they did their best.

25
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,174
Here's your sack lunch.

26
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:37,161
Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch

27
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:40,056
and two, you laugh every time you say the word "sack".

28
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,803
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.

29
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,485
I love you too, Marshmallow.

30
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,378
Uh-oh.

31
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,616
Ted?

32
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:52,573
Oh, no. No, she didn't.

33
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,626
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

34
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:56,670
Another care package?

35
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,474
Another care package.

36
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:02,284
I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month.

37
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:05,688
Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.

38
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,270
How many is that so far?

39
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:09,199
Three.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,104
And how many have you sent her?

41
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:13,348
In the mail or in my mind?

42
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,985
Zero. She's up three-zip.

43
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,889
Oh! Cupcakes!

44
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,239
Great. I bet they're delicious, too.

45
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,019
Yup, they're delicious.

46
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,361
Damn it!

47
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,743
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

48
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,559
God, I hate myself right now.

49
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,814
God, that is so me at 15.

50
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,909
Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel.

51
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,346
Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls.

52
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,722
I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things...

53
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:56,440
But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.

54
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,677
Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department

55
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,650
because he knew someone who worked there.

56
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,505
Go for Barney.

57
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:07,037
Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security.

58
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:11,058
Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.

59
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:12,195
A sasquatch?

60
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,839
That's right, sir, a Bigfoot.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,136
We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.

62
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,247
Yes!

63
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,742
Look at you.

64
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:29,667
You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.

65
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,293
Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.

66
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:37,346
Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...

67
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:38,621
There's one for awesomeness?

68
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,244
Yeah, I had it made.

69
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,686
Sit.

70
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:45,374
Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?

71
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:46,759
Please.

72
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,938
- My dawg!
- My dawg!

73
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,469
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal.

74
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,504
You're gonna be working with them.

75
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:53,909
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.

76
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,778
Nice tie. Steak sauce.

77
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:58,087
Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.

78
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,607
Where, I don't, I don't see...

79
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,104
Marshall? Sidebar.

80
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:08,861
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.

81
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:12,768
Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.

82
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,654
Ding dong! What? The doorbell?

83
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:18,170
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else.

84
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,094
But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?

85
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:21,910
I don't have a back door.

86
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.

87
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:29,852
Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.

88
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,232
Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--

89
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,251
Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.

90
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:37,457
We're still engaged, even if she's...

91
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,483
Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.

92
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,072
Sure you don't want one?

93
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,750
How many of those have you eaten?

94
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:52,117
Four. Teen. No, just four.

95
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,811
And the icing from two more.

96
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,377
So, anyway, here's the problem.

97
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,433
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.

98
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:03,851
Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great.

99
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,775
Here, listen...

100
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,737
Mmm. Mmm!

101
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:13,975
So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake...

102
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:17,244
And... I said something dumb.

103
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:20,408
Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail.

104
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,029
I sent it a couple days ago.

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,602
And it's awesome.

106
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:25,513
Really, really awesome.

107
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,361
Why did I say that?

108
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:30,150
I think frosting makes me lie.

109
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,251
Oh, Teddy boy.

110
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:36,620
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.

111
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:40,797
So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.

112
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,390
All right, here's what you do:

113
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,133
Put together a care package of stuff from New York--

114
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:49,169
some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain...

115
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,590
and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready?

116
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,436
From three days ago.

117
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,375
That's brilliant.

118
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,023
You're brilliant.

119
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,391
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,

120
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,575
I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,128
That is funny.

122
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,189
And here's why it was funny.

123
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,467
Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,

124
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:12,322
here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.

125
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,751
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.

126
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,701
Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.

127
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,180
The irony is clear, Ted.

128
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:27,074
Hey! How was your first day?

129
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,712
I don't wanna talk about it.

130
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:33,566
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.

131
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,363
- What?
- They're jerks!

132
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,099
What makes them jerks?

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,182
Forget it, I don't want to talk about it.

134
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,367
Well, like today at lunch..

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,093
What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?

136
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,686
For your information, my fiancee did.

137
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:52,304
Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?

138
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,530
No.

139
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,780
What's that?

140
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:02,840
Nothing.

141
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:03,993
Give it.

142
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:08,062
"Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad."

143
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:08,940
Give it.

144
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,890
P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it."

145
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,223
Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!

146
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:20,025
Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.

147
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,824
I know. God.

148
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,899
It's like freshman year all over again.

149
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,440
Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over.

150
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,268
Not even Old Reliable.

151
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,684
Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money,

152
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:41,272
but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.

153
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:42,847
I quit.

154
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,498
What? No. We're having so much fun.

155
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,530
You, me, working together. It's great.

156
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:51,078
We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're...

157
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,979
Seriously, what is it that you do?

158
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,317
Please.

159
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,993
I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.

160
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:01,259
Oh, of course it's not for you.

161
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,308
It's for Lily.

162
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,221
What?

163
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,701
Marshall. Lily's a catch.

164
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:11,172
But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?

165
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:12,278
The package?

166
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,747
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school.

167
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:17,096
A vacation once in a while.

168
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,158
Lily doesn't care about that stuff.

169
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,960
Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years,

170
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,077
when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary

171
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:32,927
while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.

172
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:37,893
She'll be happy.

173
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,051
Okay.

174
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:44,933
But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.

175
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:52,606
And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.

176
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,183
I guess, uh...

177
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,347
Bea Arthur.

178
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:00,517
Ahh! Wrong! Betty White.

179
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,116
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

180
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:09,282
So, did she get the awesome care package yet?

181
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,670
Yep. Yesterday.

182
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:11,808
Did she love it?

183
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,733
Ooh, she loved it.

184
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,315
So what's the problem?

185
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,549
So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you,

186
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,443
we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half.

187
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,874
Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.

188
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,688
What did you have for lunch today?

189
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,229
Oh. Rye bread.

190
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,002
Yeah.

191
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,444
Oh, Teddy boy.

192
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:52,734
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch.

193
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:54,469
Maybe it just can't be done.

194
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,784
I think it's clear what I have to do.

195
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,188
It's pretty clear.

196
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,547
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

197
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,565
Totally what I was thinking.

198
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,422
Get out of my head, man!

199
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,413
Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?

200
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,989
Marshall, consider the penguins.

201
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,426
The penguins?

202
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:20,595
On the wall.

203
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:30,133
"Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."

204
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:31,859
This is a motivational poster?

205
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,235
Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy.

206
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:37,045
And you know why? Because you're different.

207
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:42,258
Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are,

208
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,725
or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.

209
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,014
Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.

210
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:55,842
Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled,

211
00:10:55,843 --> 00:11:01,099
but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas.

212
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,679
I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them.

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,573
It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?

214
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,910
It sounds kinda like peer pressure.

215
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,194
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological

216
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,407
and it's cool and I'm doing it.

217
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:20,690
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.

218
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,704
I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.

219
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:30,056
All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?

220
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,514
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

221
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,700
And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,

222
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,994
and that meant gorilla lessons.

223
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,896
Okay, I'm psyched about this.

224
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:45,798
But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.

225
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,326
Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.

226
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:51,940
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it.

227
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,844
Show it.

228
00:11:58,488 --> 00:11:59,692
I'm psyched!

229
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,252
What was that?

230
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:11,280
Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure.

231
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:15,658
That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting

232
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,612
at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

233
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,651
Wow, that was really specific.

234
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,845
Show me you're psyched!

235
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,153
Let's do this!

236
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,082
- Ow! That hurt!
- So badly.

237
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:36,864
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.

238
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,686
Right. Get what done?

239
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,781
Whatever.

240
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:40,725
Cool.

241
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,145
And what guy is this?

242
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,723
There's always a guy.

243
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:47,522
Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.

244
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:50,640
You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?

245
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,603
All right.

246
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:59,847
So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa,

247
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:03,891
and they're all, "Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."

248
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,197
So I'm, like, "Snapadoo!"

249
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:08,847
So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport...

250
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,851
...and that is when the bouncer kicked us out.

251
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:18,236
Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring?

252
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,345
Worth every penny, bruh.

253
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:22,850
Eriksen...

254
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:27,166
...that was steak sauce!

255
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,279
Great story.

256
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,857
The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.

257
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:51,397
Uh-oh.

258
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,731
"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night.

259
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,144
This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

260
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:59,182
Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight.

261
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,193
I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."

262
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:02,696
So?

263
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:05,032
So she's going to dump me.

264
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,787
Has anyone ever said, "Listen, I've been thinking,"

265
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,409
and then follow it up with something good?

266
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,900
It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie.

267
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:14,866
What else can it be?

268
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:18,052
What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

269
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,863
I cut off all my fingers?

270
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:25,755
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it.

271
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:29,493
I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident.

272
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,706
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.

273
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,487
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.

274
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:38,315
So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?

275
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:39,587
I'd wait.

276
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,818
'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here.

277
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,680
We still on for karaoke?

278
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:52,079
Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy.

279
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:55,300
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.

280
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:56,952
Okay...

281
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,629
...what do you think?

282
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,467
Steak sauce.

283
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,853
Steak sauce?

284
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,270
Yeah.

285
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:11,138
Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business,

286
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,379
but please don't act like that around here.

287
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,961
Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...

288
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:21,930
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas,

289
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:27,399
she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces.

290
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:31,071
I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.

291
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:31,983
Why?

292
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:36,151
Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.

293
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,112
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes,

294
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:43,130
but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that.

295
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:49,665
Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?

296
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,265
Okay.

297
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:55,308
But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there?

298
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,881
Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair.

299
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,895
What do you do? Go.

300
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:05,440
Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week.

301
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:06,864
Yeah.

302
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:09,824
You're right. They're delightful.

303
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,462
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?

304
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:14,910
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.

305
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,372
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.

306
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:21,068
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really.

307
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:25,920
But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.

308
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,981
Oh, baby, they have our song.

309
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,185
Let's do "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."

310
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,421
What?

311
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:34,226
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart." Elton John, Kiki Dee.

312
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,300
No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.

313
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,022
Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.

314
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,769
"Iron Man." I could do "Iron Man."

315
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,798
Steak sauce.

316
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,371
Steak sauce, dude.

317
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,722
Should we tell him?

318
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,463
All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news.

319
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:54,447
On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR.

320
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:58,428
When you graduate, we want you working with us.

321
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,907
What do you say?

322
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,144
- Yes!
- That's my man!

323
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:08,438
I told you he would.

324
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,856
Aw, we're gonna own the office.

325
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:18,321
Okay, that was gross.

326
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:21,901
When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?

327
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:25,471
Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment.

328
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,855
I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years.

329
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:32,983
We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools.

330
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:35,175
You could quit your job and focus on your painting.

331
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,375
I know that you say you don't need it, but...

332
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:40,866
I love you and I want to give it to you anyway.

333
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,956
I want to give you the package.

334
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:47,133
The package?! You've already given me the package.

335
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:51,020
You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.

336
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:57,108
Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.

337
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,458
Your package has always been big enough.

338
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,775
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,

339
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,729
but you've got a huge package.

340
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:13,841
Yeah.

341
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:19,596
Hello.

342
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:20,693
Why hasn't she called yet?

343
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,480
Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night.

344
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,618
Go out and do something.

345
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,602
No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.

346
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,325
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.

347
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

348
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:37,147
She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.

349
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,386
Thanks.

350
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,076
Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go.

351
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,278
Break a leg.

352
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,771
And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.

353
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:52,114
I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.

354
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,374
He's giving you the blues

355
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,504
You want to graduate, but not in his bed

356
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:04,232
Here's what you got to do

357
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,595
Pick up the phone...

358
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,745
Marshall.

359
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:09,823
Hey, hey.

360
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,787
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.

361
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:12,758
Yeah.

362
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,482
Yeah.

363
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,915
How you doing?

364
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,020
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.

365
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:21,255
Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.

366
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:26,556
Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like.

367
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,657
The more I try to picture her, the more I can't.

368
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,301
Like, I remember how she makes me feel.

369
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:34,663
I just... I don't completely remember her.

370
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,598
It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.

371
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,002
Preserving something that's already gone.

372
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,067
Sounds like environmental law.

373
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,369
I don't know.

374
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,265
We struggle so hard to hold onto these things

375
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,666
that we know are going to disappear eventually.

376
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,398
And that's really noble,

377
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,130
but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot,

378
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:58,955
well, then where are you going to park your car?

379
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,477
Done dirt cheap!

380
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,167
Dirty deeds

381
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,881
Done dirt cheap!

382
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,787
Dirty deeds

383
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,515
Done dirt cheap!

384
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:19,199
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow

385
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,863
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...

386
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,228
Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?

387
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:34,446
Next up, Marshmallow and Lillypad.

388
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:49,930
Don't go breakin' my heart

389
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:53,456
I couldn't if I tried

390
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:58,279
Honey, if I get restless

391
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,758
Baby, you're not that kind...

392
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,657
It turns out some things are worth preserving.

393
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:05,266
But here's the real question:

394
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,366
It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke,

395
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,645
but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany,

396
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,188
who was supposed to call four hours ago.

397
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,840
And then the phone rings.

398
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,134
Hello.

399
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,378
Hi, Ted. It's Robin.

400
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:28,065
Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh,

401
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,323
do you want to come over?

402
00:21:30,863 --> 00:21:33,243
What do you do? Go.

403
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,508

1
00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:01,987
Previously on How I Met Your Mother:

2
00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:03,740
She was completely amazing.

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:06,606
She was amazing and funny and...

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,632
You have feelings for Ted.

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,715
Maybe.

6
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:14,024
I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.

7
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,294
Do you want to try long distance?

8
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:16,095
Yes.

9
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,285
"This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

10
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,130
And I really need to talk to you tonight."

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,220
She's going to dump me!

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,083
She's not going to break up with you, Ted.

13
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,297
Hello?

14
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,145
Do you want to come over?

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,034
Kids, your grandma always used to say to me,

16
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,722
"Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"

17
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:45,881
and she was right.

18
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:49,236
When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep.

19
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,707
Case in point:

20
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,425
Hello.

21
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,403
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

22
00:00:56,404 --> 00:01:00,827
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?

23
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:04,129
Let's back up a little bit.

24
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:16,981
Sit.

25
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,527
Good boys.

26
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:22,892
Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.

27
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:24,188
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,778
And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding,

29
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:32,310
and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career.

30
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:33,825
Thank you.

31
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,149
Yeah?

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,340
Do you have a fianc�?

33
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,475
Marshall was here yesterday.

34
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,213
They just learned the word "fianc�."

35
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,634
Oh, no, I don't have a fianc�.

36
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,045
Then who do you live with?

37
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:50,289
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.

38
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,175
Don't you get lonely?

39
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,759
No, I've got five dogs.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,152
My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.

41
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:01,842
Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady.

42
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:03,911
Not that your grandmother is...

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,427
Does anyone else have a...? Yes?

44
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:09,136
- Are you a lesbian?
- No. Are you?

45
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,328
Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...

46
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:15,194
Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter.

47
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,765
All right, our next guest is another friend...

48
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:21,052
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one.

49
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,793
What up? Tiny five.

50
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:26,991
Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters.

51
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,590
They're going to eat you alive.

52
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:31,080
He has a job doing...

53
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,497
What do you do?

54
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:33,713
Please.

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,927
Kids, let's rap.

56
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:39,209
You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?

57
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,844
- No.
- No, no.

58
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,517
I know what you want.

59
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,468
Magic.

60
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:47,666
Hello.

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,883
Why hasn't she called yet?

62
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:50,542
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

63
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:52,914
It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.

64
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:56,966
What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,486
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news?

66
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,018
I'm, like, half your viewership.

67
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,378
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

68
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,366
And we're clear.

69
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,356
So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?

70
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:11,408
No, and why does this keep coming up today?

71
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,301
Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...

72
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:16,151
What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend.

73
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,834
I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated,

74
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:21,327
but we want completely different things.

75
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:23,383
Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany

76
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:26,728
and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is.

77
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,251
And besides, we want completely different things.

78
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,212
We should have sex.

79
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,357
- What?
- Why not?

80
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:36,993
We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it.

81
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,599
At least, I'm good at it.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,919
And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.

83
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:47,163
Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard,

84
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:49,947
don't get involved with people I work with.

85
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,659
Get involved? Who said get involved?

86
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,407
I'm just saying we should have sex, it could be fun.

87
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,534
Having sex is fun.

88
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,677
Home number. Call me anytime.

89
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:02,367
A lot of local teens in action tonight...

90
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:06,522
Hey, guys.

91
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,763
Miss me?

92
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,709
I missed you, too.

93
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,952
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

94
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:09,294
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?

95
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,937
Ted?

96
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:21,287
Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.

97
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,486
Do you want to come over?

98
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,324
Why? What's up?

99
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:30,776
Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer

100
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,167
and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like,

101
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:35,666
"You know who likes juice? Ted."

102
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:38,724
I love juice.

103
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,727
Great. So you want to come over and make juice?

104
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,894
When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep

105
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,245
because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.

106
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:54,297
Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.

107
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:55,731
Yes, we'll juice.

108
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,948
O kay.

109
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,979
Okay... bye.

110
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,864
Bye.

111
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,004
This is fine. This is totally fine.

112
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,441
What's fine?

113
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:13,705
Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.

114
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:15,566
Nice.

115
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,508
No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends.

116
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:22,957
See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her.

117
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,668
She lives in Germany.

118
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,994
See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk.

119
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:30,385
I still haven't heard from her.

120
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,515
I don't know.

121
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,113
Sorry to bug you with my problems.

122
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:36,993
Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?

123
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,063
You ain't kidding, kid.

124
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,648
Want a nip?

125
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,691
You can just let me out right up here.

126
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,948
Where you going to, buddy?

127
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,747
Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.

128
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:53,413
Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy.

129
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,856
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...

130
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,921
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.

131
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,755
Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?

132
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,990
Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.

133
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,471
Right. You're going to go make some juice.

134
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,820
Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless.

135
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,747
In fact, it's healthy.

136
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,742
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?

137
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,713
I am not won...

138
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:18,298
Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.

139
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,881
Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious,

140
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:23,164
so actually, you put it in your own head.

141
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,280
Damn it!

142
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,611
Nothing's going to happen.

143
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,470
Right.

144
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,422
Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.

145
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,033
Hey, did she call?

146
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,794
No. I need a ruling.

147
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:41,964
Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but

148
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,785
I'm on my way over to Robin's right now.

149
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:48,286
She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.

150
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:49,976
Let me call you back.

151
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,050
Honey, there's a situation developing.

152
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,259
Do you remember the huge secret that you told me

153
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,351
that you weren't supposed to but you did?

154
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:04,566
The thing... about Robin?

155
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,222
Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?

156
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,101
- What?
- What?

157
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,252
Yeah, she told me already. Go on.

158
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,620
Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell?

159
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,408
She told you and not me?

160
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,199
Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,171
Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.

162
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:21,367
- That is a lie!
- It is not a lie.

163
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,223
Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!

164
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:26,792
I'll show you things you never seen before!

165
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,488
I used to box in the Army!

166
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,941
Come on, pick up.

167
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:36,503
Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!

168
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:37,467
Cupcake?

169
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,612
No, thanks.

170
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,393
Where are you? Why haven't you called?

171
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,207
Oh, I'm out hooking up...

172
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,938
with three other guys.

173
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,946
Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.

174
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,295
Yeah. Why do I doubt that?

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,768
Hello.

176
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,319
Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid

177
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,986
overturned right in front of Robin's house.

178
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:03,507
And it's melting through the sidewalk.

179
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,883
You can see straight down into hell. It's bad.

180
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,148
You should go home, dude.

181
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,383
Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.

182
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,892
Ted, what does your mom always say?

183
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,057
Nothing good ever...

184
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:18,036
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.

185
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,965
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.

186
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,898
She doesn't even like me that way.

187
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,291
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.

188
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,200
What?

189
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,907
It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you,

190
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:32,842
but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend.

191
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:34,754
Go home, Ted.

192
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:36,229
She-she likes me?

193
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,781
Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there.

194
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:42,667
Go home, Ted.

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
She likes me?

196
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,179
Go home, Ted.

197
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,585
Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.

198
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,702
Good. He's going home.

199
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:57,405
He is so not going home.

200
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,591
I cannot believe you just told him that.

201
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:00,560
What do you mean?

202
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,898
Lily, here's what you just said:

203
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,070
"Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there.

204
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,776
There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you."

205
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:10,121
"And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice."

206
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:14,498
No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.

207
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:17,009
I did have more sense than that.

208
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,188
Keep the change.

209
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,161
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

210
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,211
But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.

211
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,588
So you're doing this? You're going up there?

212
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,953
You want to get out of the way?

213
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:39,762
I'm not in the way.

214
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:43,149
You know, if you had just called me, I...

215
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,294
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:53,870
Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.

217
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,447
Or we could just drink wine.

218
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,939
Wine... not?

219
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,521
Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.

220
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,918
Thanks.

221
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,854
Make it a big glass.

222
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,163
Sure.

223
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:06,608
So, how's it hanging?

224
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:13,315
Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens

225
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:17,571
but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore

226
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,761
or what the hell you're doing with your life?

227
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,757
Do you ever have one of those days?

228
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,574
Uh, about once a week.

229
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,792
I don't know, it was just a, a rough day

230
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:30,632
and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you.

231
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:37,051
So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?

232
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:40,853
When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.

233
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:42,657
We broke up.

234
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,366
What?

235
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,555
Yeah. Yeah, she finally called.

236
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:49,113
We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is--

237
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:52,263
and then... she dumped me.

238
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:58,325
Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.

239
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,504
You're smiling.

240
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,867
Am I? No I'm not.

241
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,750
I'm a news anchor.

242
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,471
Smiling's a part of the job.

243
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:09,407
Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today.

244
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:10,860
See?

245
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:14,377
You're smiling, too.

246
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:17,980
Yeah.

247
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:21,065
I have no idea what that's all about.

248
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:27,936
# There's got to be a morning after... #

249
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,250
How much does Korean Elvis rock?

250
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,448
I'll answer that.

251
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,095
Infinity.

252
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,259
He rocks... infinity.

253
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:37,926
Okay, it's time for bed.

254
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:40,258
What? No. It's 2:30.

255
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,053
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.

256
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,827
You know, I have found, in my travels...

257
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:50,131
that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m.

258
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,615
When I look back at the best stories of my life--

259
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:56,723
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy,

260
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:59,047
- the almost four-way.
- You never had a four-way.

261
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:01,098
I said "almost."

262
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,821
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.

263
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:10,257
because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.

264
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:11,669
We're going home.

265
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,664
What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof?

266
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:15,918
Okay.

267
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,752
Korean Elvis.

268
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:23,230
How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?

269
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,076
Rock 'n' roll.

270
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:28,275
And it begins.

271
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:33,538
So, um... Hey. I got a new phone.

272
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,974
Same as yours. Look.

273
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,964
Oh, yeah. Do you like it?

274
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,510
Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,782
This is some solid small talk.

276
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:45,049
I had that other phone, and it was good,

277
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,147
but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead.

278
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,123
This phone... um...

279
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,645
feels right.

280
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:57,620
Wow. Weird.

281
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:01,038
Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.

282
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,888
I'll be here.

283
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,487
Hello?

284
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:11,702
Ted, this is your main man, K.E.

285
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:15,202
I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?

286
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:16,680
Sorry about that.

287
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,271
Was that Korean Elvis?

288
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,468
I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.

289
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,201
Um... Actually...

290
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm at Robin's.

291
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:29,167
Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad.

292
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,991
I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.

293
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:36,517
Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis,

294
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:39,419
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?

295
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,608
What do you expect from me? It's Robin.

296
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,682
Victoria's great, but, it's Robin.

297
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,470
I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.

298
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,328
Gonna?

299
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,983
Yes. First thing tomorrow.

300
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:57,166
Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend.

301
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,779
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.

302
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,425
But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime.

303
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:09,250
Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.

304
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:10,990
I hate how you're always right.

305
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:13,699
It's my best and most annoying trait.

306
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,426
Okay.

307
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,420
I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.

308
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:35,074
I should probably get going. It's pretty late.

310
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,886
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh. Oh, no. I understand.

311
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,416
It's fine. Yeah.

312
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,765
Can I call you tomorrow?

313
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,877
Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.

314
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,288
Okay. Good night, Robin.

315
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,719
Good night, Ted.

316
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,634
Oh, my God. We're making out.

317
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,820
- Right.
- This is crazy.

318
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,444
Right? Right?

319
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,351
Should we go to my room?

320
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,574
I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...

321
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:34,639
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

322
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,543
Yeah.

323
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:44,201
I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.

324
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:46,607
Okay.

325
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,424
Stop doing that.

326
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,038
Whatcha doin'?

327
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:04,874
I'm calling you.

328
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,111
We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now,

329
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.

330
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,586
Okay.

331
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,958
Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be?

332
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,676
Length of an average pee?

333
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:18,708
No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes.

334
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,640
Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...

335
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,036
What do you want from me?

336
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:25,547
People break up. It happens.

337
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,535
Not like this.

338
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:30,959
Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.

339
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,440
It's not ideal.

340
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,763
Meanwhile, back at the bar,

341
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,585
Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.

342
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,362
Come on, Lily.

343
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:46,987
How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?

344
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,310
I think he just spat on me.

345
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:54,162
Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.

346
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,016
- No! No, come on.
- Yes!

347
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:59,123
Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the "le".

348
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:02,199
We still got the "gen." The "da." The "ry."

349
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,335
Okay, if we're at the "le," then I say we follow it up with a "t's go home."

350
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,650
Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.

351
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:15,322
No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go.

352
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,734
Just one dance, huh?

353
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,161
Okay, seriously.

354
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:21,282
Hey, I know what you like.

355
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:31,511
And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary.

356
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:35,595
It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.

357
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:40,242
Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?

358
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,158
You're right.

359
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,432
I owe you a real breakup call.

360
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,948
I'll call you tomorrow.

361
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,332
Good.

362
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,945
So you're gonna go home?

363
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,589
Why should I have to go home?

364
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:56,358
You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.

365
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:56,993
Ted.

366
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,353
It could happen.

367
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,724
And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?

368
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,353
Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but...

369
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:08,417
It's Robin.

370
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:09,997
And I'm exhausted.

371
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,641
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her.

372
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,171
I think that makes this okay.

373
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:17,067
Oh, please. You just want to get laid.

374
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,453
Yes, I do. You got me.

375
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:22,137
That is exactly what I want right now. And so what?

376
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:23,822
I want this. She wants this.

377
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:27,070
It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany.

378
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:30,201
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.

379
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,824
Thanks for not calling me and good night.

380
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,914
That's not your phone.

381
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,715
This isn't my phone.

382
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:47,784
Okay. Bye.

383
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:52,272
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.

384
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:53,875
Was it...?

385
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,682
It was your girlfriend.

386
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,400
You might want to call her back.

387
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:23,988
I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up.

388
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,961
Yes...

389
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:28,273
And there you have it, kids.

390
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:31,252
The stupidest thing I've ever done.

391
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,324
In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about.

392
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,789
And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom.

393
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:53,116
So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this:

394
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:57,642
when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.

395

1
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,860
Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set?

2
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,887
Disc three.

3
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:20,063
My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on.

4
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:21,609
Disc three!

5
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:25,237
God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.

6
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:26,767
What do you mean "could"?

7
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:31,420
I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl.

8
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:34,410
It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,438
Trust that impulse, Ted.

10
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:40,500
Hey. Something kind of cool just happened.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,940
My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,963
A... LAME-A?

13
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,917
We prefer Local Area Media Award.

14
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,613
Um... there's going to be this big banquet.

15
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:57,844
I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came.

16
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,718
And there's an open bar.

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,957
- Yes!
- Word up!

18
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,485
Yeah, put me down for two.

19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:04,984
Really? It's three months away.

20
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,981
I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.

21
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:12,790
I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.

22
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,331
I'm going to miss Victoria.

23
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,954
I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.

24
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,820
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were

25
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,580
so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?

26
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,878
Yes, that's what I meant by "you know."

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,774
I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls.

28
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,767
- Look, I shouldn't go.
- You should definitely go.

29
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:40,885
Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.

30
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:44,122
Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter.

31
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,578
Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.

32
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,471
- That's only two.
- Count again.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:54,325
Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.

34
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:55,537
So get an escort.

35
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:57,776
By "escort," you mean prostitute?

36
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:58,824
Why not?

37
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,596
Because... gross?

38
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:05,246
Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution?

39
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,524
Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.

40
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:10,253
You really think that's true?

41
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:13,597
Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers,

42
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,002
like, an extra fish for putting out.

43
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,498
Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen.

44
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,512
Kaboom! You've been lawyered.

45
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,488
Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,454
Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?

47
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:31,801
Yes.

48
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,705
No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?

49
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,535
That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed.

50
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:44,052
The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century.

51
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:48,898
You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.

52
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,197
- You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.

53
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,357
Lawyered.

54
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,721
The point is, how long has it been?

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,618
57 days.

56
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,067
- Is that your water? May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

57
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,169
Much obliged.

58
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,573
57 days?!

59
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:10,387
- Ted, you are in a slump.
- No, it's not a slump.

60
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,686
It's an intentional hiatus from girls.

61
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,561
A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate.

62
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,378
But I'm off the roster, baby.

63
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,685
I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool.

64
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:22,163
And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.

65
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,242
Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room?

66
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:27,387
A naked dudes hanging brain.

67
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,104
Ted, you need a lady.

68
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,947
And I've got the next best thing-- Mary.

69
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,404
She lives in my building.

70
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,720
She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.

71
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,124
Oh, she sounds great.

72
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,716
And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday.

73
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:43,334
You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.

74
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:48,837
You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic?

75
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,622
That's racism.

76
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:53,017
And I do not drink with racists.

77
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,520
Good day.

78
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,563
You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...

79
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,246
I said good day!

80
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,920
So should I wear my hair up or down?

81
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,377
Lily.

82
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,446
What?

83
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:14,628
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

84
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,885
I'm just exhausted from work.

85
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:20,585
The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes

86
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:24,323
and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day.

87
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:28,533
It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.

88
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,199
Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were?

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,591
Is that safe?

90
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:35,485
Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?

91
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,991
Ted's still coming to this thing, right?

92
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:41,232
Yep.

93
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:46,060
Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?

94
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,037
Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.

95
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,108
No, it's just this guy at the station.

96
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:57,285
I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes.

97
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,718
Is it going to be weird?

98
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,069
No, it's not going to be weird at all.

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,827
Robin's bringing a date.

100
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,801
Boy. That's going to be really weird.

101
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,354
I know.

102
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,294
Robin's bringing a date.

103
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,942
Oh. Okay. That's not weird.

104
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,375
She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.

105
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,545
- Dude, it's going to be weird.
- No, it's fine.

106
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:21,891
Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends.

107
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:22,988
I don't think it'll be weird.

108
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,685
- Yeah, it won't be weird.
- Thank you.

109
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,989
Because you're going to bring your own date.

110
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,488
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mary.

111
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,872
Have you met Ted?

112
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,649
Nice to meet you Ted.

113
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,042
Hi, Mary.

114
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,693
Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.

115
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,269
So we're going to an award show?

116
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,090
Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute?

117
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,103
Barney.

118
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:48,197
See you in two shakes, Mare.

119
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:49,527
You two make yourselves comfortable.

120
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,197
What the hell?

121
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:57,695
Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow.

122
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,361
So I got you a date for the evening.

123
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:01,437
You got me a hooker.

124
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,574
A really hot hook-- A hooker!

125
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,678
Think about it, this is perfect.

126
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,670
A-- it will make Robin insanely jealous...

127
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:12,390
B-- you get to have sex with her...

128
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,748
and C-- maybe by getting to know Mary,

129
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,110
you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too.

130
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,277
And D-- "B" all night long.

131
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:24,124
I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.

132
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,381
The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall.

133
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,456
No one will suspect a thing.

134
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:31,292
They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and...

135
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,392
Okay, that's a little bit suspicious.

136
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,326
Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight.

137
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,638
But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.

138
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,020
500 bucks?

139
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,162
Ted, you're my cabron.

140
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:48,883
You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority?

141
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,275
Look at how hot she is.

142
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,308
Robin would be so jealous.

143
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,350
I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney.

144
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,142
Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.

145
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,183
And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.

146
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,927
Check out Robin's date.

147
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,067
I know.

148
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,402
Is that who I think it is?

149
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,410
Yep.

150
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,691
It's Sandy Rivers.

151
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,709
Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One,

152
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,876
the most low-budget cable news network ever.

153
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:22,182
Sandy time. Sandy time!

154
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:25,876
He was best known for his morning segment "In Today's Paper,"

155
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,910
during which he literally flipped through today's papers,

156
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,371
reading them aloud to viewers.

157
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:33,996
Here we have, on the front page, a story about a...

158
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:38,361
I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building.

159
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,502
Looks interesting.

160
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:45,079
These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.

161
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,166
Which Sandy do we want today?

162
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,737
French Sandy, porn star Sandy...?

163
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,103
Yosemite Sandy, definitely.

164
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,791
Excellent choice.

165
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,114
I love this guy.

166
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,517
I hate this guy.

167
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,509
Hey.

168
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,463
- Hi.
- I'm Lily.

169
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:15,024
Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.

170
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,659
Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her.

171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,093
Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary.

172
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,285
Look, a beer.

173
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,036
Hey.

174
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,093
Hi.

175
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,333
- You look nice.
- Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.

176
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:32,621
Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.

177
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:34,052
Hi, Sandy.

178
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,444
Rivers.

179
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,607
So are you two, uh...

180
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,619
Starting a bunch of office rumors?

181
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,243
Looks that way. Looks that way.

182
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,517
Oh, how rude of me.

183
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:48,703
Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers...

184
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,961
this is Mary, my date.

185
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,627
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards.

186
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,536
Please say hello to our host for the evening,

187
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:07,919
king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie,

188
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,619
Vampire Lou!

189
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,756
Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting

190
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,014
and the triumph of the human spirit.

191
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:24,911
Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.

192
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,310
I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.

193
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:32,308
Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man.

194
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,884
Secrets come out in there.

195
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,226
Oh, please. How's it's going to come out?

196
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,046
"Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money."

197
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,381
- Who has sex for money?
- Nobody.

198
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,632
What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?

199
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,376
No, not really.

200
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,878
We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick.

201
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,906
Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie?

202
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:57,119
You know, it just makes no sense.

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,032
God, that pisses me off.

204
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:00,700
Lily, you okay?

205
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,208
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.

206
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,467
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.

207
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:09,111
"Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky."

208
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,393
Wow. Why are you so tired?

209
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:18,645
Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.

210
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,249
Lily, quit your job.

211
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,634
Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board,

212
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,367
and you'll make a ton more money.

213
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:25,536
Well, guess what, Barney?

214
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:29,193
I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make,

215
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,349
unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.

216
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,294
Well, it's just an internship, for the record.

217
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:37,328
Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck,

218
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,245
what would that make me?

219
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,060
A prostitute.

220
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,529
Exactly. Thank you, Mary.

221
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,025
So, Mary, what do you do for a living?

222
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,707
She's a paralegal.

223
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:51,346
Yes, I'm a paralegal.

224
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,802
Oh, so, Mary the paralegal.

225
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,583
What does a paralegal do exactly?

226
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:02,055
I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.

227
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,738
Oh, what firm?

228
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:06,129
Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.

229
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,530
That's a real law firm.

230
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,006
I know.

231
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,607
Nice.

232
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,210
You're pretty good on your feet.

233
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,927
Are you flirting with me?

234
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,337
Is that allowed?

235
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:18,735
Yes, it's encouraged.

236
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:22,699
You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but...

237
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,198
well, considering...

238
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:27,813
I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!

239
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,496
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

240
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:33,759
Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him.

241
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,545
Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.

242
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,163
So, Sandy, what do you do?

243
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,039
Oh, wait, I know what you do.

244
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,026
You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.

245
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,556
You got me.

246
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,100
What do you do, Ted?

247
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,424
Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning.

248
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,170
But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect

249
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,664
where I make an actual contribution to the world.

250
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:58,460
I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.

251
00:11:58,461 --> 00:11:59,769
Thanks.

252
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:01,888
I never tire of hearing that.

253
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:10,001
Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head?

254
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:13,178
Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?

255
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:18,739
You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love.

256
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:21,676
Damn, you just got even hotter.

257
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,932
And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize,

258
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:32,704
this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.

259
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,569
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,219
Mary seems nice.

261
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,788
Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting

262
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:44,953
until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?

263
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:48,080
I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.

264
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,933
And just like that, it's all okay.

265
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:50,932
Roll credits.

266
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,907
So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?

267
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,927
- We're still friends.
- Are we?

268
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,995
You don't return my calls, we never hang out

269
00:12:57,996 --> 00:13:01,373
and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?

270
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:05,438
Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?

271
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,517
Oh, so now she's a whore?

272
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,646
What?

273
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:13,088
You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome.

274
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,199
And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous,

275
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,051
I came here to support you as a friend.

276
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:19,453
And frankly, I'm sick of trying.

277
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:24,552
I like that guy.

278
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,389
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,986
What were you guys talking about over there?

280
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:36,534
Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.

281
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:38,455
Well, thanks.

282
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:42,431
You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.

283
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:43,853
Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel.

284
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:45,590
You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.

285
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,981
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.

286
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,562
Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts.

287
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,408
Actually, don't use the mini-bar.

288
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,783
Do it. Come on, Ted, do it.

289
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:06,244
This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.

290
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,353
Sleep with a prostitute?

291
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:09,689
No, lose your virginity. What up.

292
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:14,194
Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute

293
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:18,140
are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.

294
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:18,910
You just made that up.

295
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,589
- Withdrawn.
- Lawyered.

296
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:23,439
Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up.

297
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,514
And second of all, you cannot do this.

298
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,162
It's wrong on every level.

299
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:31,558
And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.

300
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,110
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame.

301
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:36,081
She's really cool.

302
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:38,772
- Yeah, well... there we go.
- Scooter "Bam-Bam" Branson for

303
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:42,454
A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap?

304
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:46,578
Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted.

305
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,768
And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog.

306
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,220
And the winner is...

307
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,519
Robin Scherbotsky.

308
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:01,353
Thanks.

309
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:06,854
Oh, wow. This is really a surprise.

310
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:11,777
Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends.

311
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,152
They're all here tonight.

312
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,886
Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers...

313
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,302
Barney...

314
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,062
And that's it. Those are all my friends.

315
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:24,425
Thank you.

316
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:34,419
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

317
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,678
Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?

318
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,568
Sure. Let's go.

319
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,297
Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs?

320
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,755
We, uh, got a room.

321
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,729
Dude, what are you doing?

322
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,019
What's it look like?

323
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,126
It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.

324
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:58,116
Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her.

325
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,488
Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.

326
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,726
Oh, that's real mature.

327
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,078
Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?

328
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,367
Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it.

329
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,388
Fine. Do what you want.

330
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,015
Hey.

331
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,163
Should we go?

332
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,508
Yeah.

333
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,985
Thanks.

334
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,371
Well...

335
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:20,913
Good night.

336
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,578
Good night.

337
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,521
So, did you and Barney ever...?

338
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,122
There's not enough money in the world.

339
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,646
Oh, thank God.

340
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,379
Wow, so they're...?

341
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,856
Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?

342
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,580
I put him in a cab.

343
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:55,944
So you and he aren't...?

344
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:58,046
I don't date people I work with.

345
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,523
I was just trying to make Ted jealous.

346
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,483
Is he...?

347
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:03,450
He's off trying to make you jealous.

348
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,505
Oh, well, good for them.

349
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,524
And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.

350
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,933
Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this,

351
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,539
and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes.

352
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,769
Mary's not a paralegal.

353
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,391
She's a prostitute.

354
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,551
Mary's a prostitute?

355
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:24,931
What?!

356
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,395
Barney paid for her.

357
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,725
Is that true?

358
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:31,860
We were having a conversation about prostitution,

359
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,826
and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar

360
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,783
and now she and Ted are upstairs.

361
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:39,260
Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately?

362
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,636
Is he having a nervous breakdown?

363
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,944
You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low,

364
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:48,752
but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle.

365
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:53,927
Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!

366
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,245
That's her napkin.

367
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,576
No!

368
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,770
Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any.

369
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,153
In keeping with tonight's award show motif,

370
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,533
I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending!

371
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,689
Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?

372
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:17,014
"Mary's not really a prostitute."

373
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:18,070
What?

374
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:19,900
That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.

375
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,419
- So she's not...?
- No.

376
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,771
Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building.

377
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:25,834
Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part--

378
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:28,520
she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker.

379
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,298
Oh, come on.

380
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,725
If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

381
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,782
I feel kind of like Richard Gere.

382
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:51,073
- Not shy about your looks, are you?
- No.

383
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:56,552
You know, Mary, I've never done this before.

384
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,982
Done what?

385
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:02,555
You know, been... on a "date."

386
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,387
Yeah, right.

387
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,632
Wait, you're kidding, right?

388
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,915
No.

389
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,793
Why, is that so odd?

390
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:15,465
Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.

391
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,866
God, you were just a kid.

392
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,182
Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...

393
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:26,894
Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.

394
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:28,762
Must be tough.

395
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,446
Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone.

396
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,543
I mean, talk about anal.

397
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:42,289
Well, here we are.

398
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:49,169
Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot.

399
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,358
I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this.

400
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,780
You're a hooker.

401
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,162
What?

402
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:00,351
Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me.

403
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,531
I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.

404
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,497
No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.

405
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,413
Come on, Mary, there's no one else around.

406
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,045
You're a hooker.

407
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,207
No, Ted...

408
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:12,999
I'm a paralegal.

409
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:16,190
No, you're a hooker.

410
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:20,643
No, I'm a paralegal.

411
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:26,161
You're a paralegal.

412
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:31,815
That was not funny.

413
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,131
Not funny, dude.

414
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,665
I know, it was hilarious.

415
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,461
Why would you do that?

416
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,309
I did it to prove a point.

417
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,050
What point?

418
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:44,457
Stay with me. It's going to come to me.

419
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,306
No. Ah, okay, here's the point.

420
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,306
You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right?

421
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:54,161
So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date.

422
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:57,146
All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet

423
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:58,333
and your slump is over.

424
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:01,440
So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?

425
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,583
Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.

426
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,496
She slapped me and stormed off.

427
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,320
Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.

428
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:12,097
I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.

429
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:15,670
Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.

430
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,450
Your room?

431
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,532
Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card--

432
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,584
never checked out.

433
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,782
By the way, you know what's super fun?

434
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,491
Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain.

435
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,524
Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.

436
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:34,841
Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

1
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:21,253
Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement,

2
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,039
there occurred a game-changing emergency.

3
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:25,524
Van Smoot is available.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,803
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:30,358
Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River.

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,886
It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding,

7
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,390
but it was never available.

8
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,885
And then, suddenly, it was.

9
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:39,140
There was a cancellation two months from now.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,510
You want to have our wedding in two months?

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,080
No. It's impossible.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,833
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!

13
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,003
No, there's just not enough time. There's no way...

14
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,176
Oh! Mini-vomit.

15
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:53,811
Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it.

16
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:57,170
If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,866
Todd and Valerie?

18
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:03,988
When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,042
that seems to be one step ahead of you.

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,317
Todd and Valerie were that couple.

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,900
We got to make a decision.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,995
Todd and Valerie are in motion.

23
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:16,302
Van Smoot!

24
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:18,617
Oh! Kids, color!

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,225
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, come on, come on.

26
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,217
Hello, Marshall.

27
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,205
Lily.

28
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,737
Todd.

29
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:45,747
Valerie.

30
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,155
Stairs.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,150
I can't believe it.

32
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,462
We got Van Smoot House.

33
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,110
It is on. It is on!

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,885
Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

35
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:02,887
- What?
- You're a wonder.

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,052
Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.

37
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:06,663
How are you going to get everything done?

38
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:10,191
Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.

39
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:13,216
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.

40
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:17,753
Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated

41
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,415
my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.

42
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:23,108
- Was it...?
- It was your girlfriend.

43
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,357
You might want to call her back.

44
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:30,042
Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist?

45
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:35,545
And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.

46
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,717
Wow. That was really awkward, Lil.

47
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:43,536
And still. It's still really awkward right now.

48
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,738
Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?

49
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,531
Okay, your job is very simple.

50
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:54,717
At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.

51
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,026
Lil, you know I can't promise that.

52
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:05,446
Shh! Shh!

53
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:08,916
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.

54
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,688
Hey, babe.

55
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,763
Hey, little one.

56
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,856
- Hey, Lilypad.
- Crap!

57
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,070
Band! We forgot a band!

58
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,990
It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.

59
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,143
Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it.

60
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,082
I called The 88!

61
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:26,941
- Who?
- The 88.

62
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,291
They're this awesome band.

63
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,810
They played my law review party. They were found guilty.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,851
On three counts of rocking.

65
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,936
I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.

66
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,681
John "Bonzo" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?

67
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,277
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin,

68
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,465
who died in 1980, got married two months ago.

69
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:48,100
Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen.

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,382
We... we don't even know if they can play our song.

71
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:52,890
They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,733
Baby, The 88 don't audition.

73
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,905
They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.

74
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,708
Well, then... I have to say no.

75
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,180
Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,368
Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?

77
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,758
Let me check their Website.

78
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,006
What?

79
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,781
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.

80
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,091
Intense?

81
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:19,471
I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people.

82
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,383
Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table,

83
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:26,698
I need you to roll with it, okay?

84
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,087
Wow.

85
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:32,051
Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.

86
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:33,306
We already have a caterer.

87
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:35,328
Oh, right. You're getting married.

88
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,105
You see what I did there? Took a...

89
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:44,252
It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.

90
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,682
A prom? Can... can we go to that?

91
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,918
Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

92
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:52,465
Yeah. No, they won't.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,590
Why not?

94
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,423
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.

95
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,022
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.

96
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:59,101
We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.

97
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,123
Yes, we are. It's the only way.

98
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:04,816
You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.

99
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,661
It's nine weeks till the wedding.

100
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,611
At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.

101
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,395
- Well...
- No, Barney.

102
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,795
And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.

103
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:19,518
- I'll go with you.
- Really?

104
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,100
Yeah. I never got to go to my prom.

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,835
We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.

106
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,095
Lesbian.

107
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,992
The cough is supposed to cover the "lesbian."

108
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:31,478
No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.

109
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,530
Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?

110
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,393
Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep,

111
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:41,147
and you've got "statutory" written all over your body.

112
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,343
Hey, why don't we all go?

113
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,621
I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in.

114
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,907
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

115
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah, you're right.

116
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,862
Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding.

117
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,292
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?

118
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,563
Sounds awesome.

119
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,641
We should go out and just get freakin' weird.

120
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:58,292
Yeah.

121
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:02,133
'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.

122
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,868
What?

123
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,871
Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear?

124
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,418
Lame!

125
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,875
But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.

126
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:19,956
All right, what do you think?

127
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:21,808
Horrible.

128
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,576
You're gonna make such a great dad.

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
You look so classy and nice.

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,700
You're going to stick out like a sore thumb.

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,860
Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days,

132
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,358
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris?

133
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,818
They all dress like strippers.

134
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,435
It's go ho or go home.

135
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,392
Well, we have to get in.

136
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:42,283
I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday,

137
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:45,192
'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...

138
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,673
Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay?

139
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,620
Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.

140
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,830
All right.

141
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,728
That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!

142
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,072
I never thought this would be a bad thing,

143
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,905
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.

144
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,452
I didn't know I still had this.

145
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,843
What?

146
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,977
The dress I wore to my actual prom.

147
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:21,251
Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom,

148
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:25,858
and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot.

149
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,498
Like a hot soul.

150
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,803
Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.

151
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:32,231
So big news.

152
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:35,200
I heard from umpire school. I'm in!

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,706
Oh, disco!

154
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,601
I am so happy for you.

155
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:44,001
You mean happy for us, right, babe?

156
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:47,681
Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.

157
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,092
No, baby.

158
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:52,268
We're gonna be an umpire someday.

159
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:58,341
Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.

160
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,390
No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go.

161
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,553
I'm not showing anymore...

162
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:05,080
Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.

163
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,826
Aw. Sweet.

164
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,706
Thank you.

165
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,920
Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?

166
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,423
No.

167
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:17,428
I've never been to prom before, okay?

168
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:18,930
We got to go. See ya.

169
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,147
Bye, have fun.

170
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,605
See you.

171
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:26,293
They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?

172
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,841
So, what, we ready for tonight?

173
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,912
Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.

174
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:30,861
Shot of Jim Beam?

175
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,111
- Yeah.
- Yes!

176
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,763
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.

177
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:36,616
What?!

178
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:39,297
I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.

179
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,137
Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break.

180
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:46,142
Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad,

181
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:49,481
but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.

182
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:52,313
Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it.

183
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:55,905
First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.

184
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,846
Do I look like I'm four?

185
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:00,236
All right, what kind of prize are we talking?

186
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:05,210
Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.

187
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,491
Is this gonna work?

188
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:10,572
Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time.

189
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,703
It's all about confidence.

190
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,077
Follow me.

191
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,983
Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody.

192
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,820
Going to prom-- whee-hoo!

193
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,818
- Uh, you're adults.
- Okay, bye.

194
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,623
Okay, look, I just need to see the band.

195
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,790
I'm getting married in two months, and...

196
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,830
And you're just finding a band?

197
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,646
Hey, ho, hey!

198
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,616
I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.

199
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,150
Wow. "Ma'am?" Check and mate.

200
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,681
It's cool. Time to activate plan B.

201
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:47,635
Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow?

202
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,248
Scherbotsky?

203
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,665
Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?

204
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,185
We don't have that kind of money.

205
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,607
For free.

206
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,172
Oh, hell yeah!

207
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,623
Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.

208
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:04,027
- Hi. Shall we?
- Sure.

209
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:08,117
I knew it would happen. This is the dream.

210
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:10,571
Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?

211
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,885
Don't worry about me. I'll get in.

212
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:16,465
Oh... I'll get in.

213
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,133
We're in!

214
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,881
Thank you. We're going to take a break.

215
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,116
Oh, you're kidding me.

216
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,128
Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?

217
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,077
Yeah, what the hell? It's prom.

218
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,821
That tastes like cough syrup.

219
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,873
Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol.

220
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:51,031
Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20.

221
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,416
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.

222
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,127
Nerds who aren't good at math?

223
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,308
Life's going to be rough, boys.

224
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:03,123
Hi. Excuse me.

225
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:06,840
I was wondering if you guys could play "Good Feeling" by the Violent Femmes.

226
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,783
I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married

227
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,411
and my fianc� wants to hire you guys as the band,

228
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:15,851
but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play "Good Feeling" because that's our song,

229
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:20,020
and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?

230
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,313
Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that.

231
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:27,807
But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.

232
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:31,506
So, you buzzing, baby?

233
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,116
My phlegm feels looser.

234
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,128
This is pathetic.

235
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,205
It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights.

236
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:55,053
If I got in a fight, would you have my back?

237
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,666
You know it.

238
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,468
I'd have your back, too.

239
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,846
That's cool.

240
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,607
What, you don't think you'd need my help?

241
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,398
You don't know what I can do. I'm like...

242
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,553
like a berserker.

243
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:11,885
Okay, Ted.

244
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,162
Hello.

245
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:16,680
Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music

246
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,302
for "Good Feeling" and bring it out here, like, now.

247
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:21,341
Hang on.

248
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,435
It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom.

249
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,648
- Can Ted come?
- Wait! Don't ask!

250
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,081
That's so lame!

251
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,115
I don't even want to go anyway.

252
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,081
Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.

253
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:35,757
What'd she say? What'd she say?

254
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,797
He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me.

255
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:45,175
I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive.

256
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:48,711
Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's,

257
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,091
it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.

258
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,606
Okay, bye.

259
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,998
She totally wants you to come.

260
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:02,888
All right, sheet music's on the way.

261
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,785
Are you okay?

262
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,333
There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling.

263
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,453
It's just all moving too fast.

264
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:17,183
How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.

265
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,290
I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.

266
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,611
What's decided?

267
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,903
I go to umpire school, you go to college.

268
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,023
We move into my dad's house in Staten Island.

269
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:31,161
We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided?

270
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:32,848
It's wide open!

271
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:39,738
Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.

272
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,427
You're, you're breaking up with me?

273
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:45,930
There's still so much I want to do.

274
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,032
I want to travel, live overseas as an artist,

275
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,848
maybe have a lesbian relationship.

276
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:58,260
Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.

277
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,165
I can't believe this.

278
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,340
I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain.

279
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,415
Please, just don't leave me.

280
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,412
I'm nothing without you, baby.

281
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:11,603
Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!

282
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,313
It's just one dance, God!

283
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,567
What?

284
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,655
Well, we did promise them one dance.

285
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,308
Yeah, sure, okay.

286
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:31,220
So Andrew, what's your big plan?

287
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,671
What's life going to be like after tonight?

288
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,811
Well, you know I got it all worked out.

289
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:39,263
Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college,

290
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:43,566
and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.

291
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,563
- No, you won't.
- I won't?

292
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:49,023
No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to.

293
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:53,061
You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence

294
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,631
and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old

295
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:59,271
before your time wondering "Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"

296
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,433
Whoa.

297
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,827
You really think I'll get a girlfriend?

298
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:08,478
So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?

299
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,846
Oh, Sean, look, um,

300
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,276
you're a nice guy, but I just don't...

301
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,918
No, you're not getting lucky tonight.

302
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,508
Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.

303
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,746
Okay.

304
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,341
How'd you get in here?

305
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,086
What's it to you, giant turtle?

306
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:44,496
It's me, Barney.

307
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,081
Oh, hey. Where's Lily?

308
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,473
She's in the bathroom.

309
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,613
- Wait here, I should go talk to the band.
- All right.

310
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:51,821
How did you guys get in here?

311
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:52,922
We just snuck in the back.

312
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,292
You just snu... Are you serious?

313
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,310
I've been trying to get in here all night.

314
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,382
I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.

315
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:03,938
But you got in.

316
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,896
Slow and steady won the race.

317
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,990
Hey, bro, have you seen my fianc�e Lily?

318
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,401
Your fianc�e?

319
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,190
Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro.

320
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,178
Unless you're looking for trouble.

321
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:21,482
Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...

322
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,550
No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this.

323
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,951
I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.

324
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,663
Whoa, whoa.

325
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,332
Look, let's not get carried away.

326
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,375
Yah! Nunchaku!

327
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,263
I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.

328
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:42,456
I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me.

329
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm going to ask you something and, um,

330
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,290
maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever.

331
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,045
But, um, are you having second thoughts?

332
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,785
Yeah.

333
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,091
But not about Marshall.

334
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,582
About me.

335
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:05,925
I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago

336
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:08,847
and wondering what happened to her.

337
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,776
I don't want to be tied down.

338
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,932
I want to live in France and Spain and Italy

339
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,741
and just soak up life and put it on a canvas,

340
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:22,591
even if it means being a waitress in crappy caf�s for five years, I don't care.

341
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,112
I'm going to be a painter.

342
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:29,668
And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know?

343
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,132
But anyway, I'm blabbering.

344
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,447
Way to make new friends, Lily.

345
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,777
I'm sorry. What was your name again?

346
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,327
Marshall.

347
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,103
Nice to meet you, Marshall.

348
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,036
Guess we're hallmates.

349
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,488
Yeah.

350
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,815
It works.

351
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:53,767
Violent Femmes. I love this song.

352
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,618
Me, too.

353
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:02,795
I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to.

354
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:06,460
The travel, the bohemian art life,

355
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,090
my big lesbian experience.

356
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,268
I didn't do any of it.

357
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:15,790
Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world.

358
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,798
I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?

359
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,267
Yeah.

360
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:25,890
And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint.

361
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,016
And as far as your lesbian experience...

362
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,966
Happy?

363
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,317
Yeah.

364
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:37,825
- So field hockey, huh? 
- Shut up.

365
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,723
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.

366
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:46,298
This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000.

367
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,462
We can have you guys arrested, you know that?

368
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,962
Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus.

369
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,692
You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.

370
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,873
I totally could have taken that kid.

371
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,780
Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...

372
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,013
Well, I don't need it, but thanks.

373
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,452
Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.

374
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,595
No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic.

375
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:06,550
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.

376
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,177
Absolutely not.

377
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,247
You guys will thank me for this later, okay?

378
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:17,296
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?
- Hey!

379
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,045
You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.

380
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,967
This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.

381
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,535
So how was your first prom?

382
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,807
You tell me.

383
00:19:56,813 --> 00:20:00,590
I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me,

384
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,988
there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.

385
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,737
So, basically, it was a prom.

386
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,157
Okay, I've missed you.

387
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,077
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

388
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:16,185
not even in an I-forgive-you way.

389
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:19,037
Just in a I've-missed-you way.

390
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:21,808
I'll take what I can get.

391
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,520
And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth

392
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,326
when you wear jeans to a strip club.

393
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,790
So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.

394
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,875
Yeah, it's good.

395
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,745
Band? Check.

396
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:44,267
Two months, baby.

397
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,215
Two months.

398
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:49,047
Two months.

1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,871
Kids, life is a dark road.

2
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:18,864
You never really know what's up ahead.

3
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,602
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,

4
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:23,302
and then all of a sudden,

5
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:25,470
you're 28.

6
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,788
And for the birthday boy, lasagna.

7
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:28,736
Thank you.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,860
Careful. The plate is very hot.

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:31,984
'Kay.

10
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:34,736
Oh, go on, touch it.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,362
Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,693
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?

13
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,027
Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.

14
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:45,252
I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.

15
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:47,493
You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing

16
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,951
and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck...

17
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,295
in addition to probably being kind of healthy.

18
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:57,075
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,228
Barney.

20
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:00,707
Oy, gevalt.

21
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:04,578
- Ah... Happy birthday, Ted. 
- Whoo-hoo!

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,758
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...

23
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,035
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:11,172
What?

25
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,090
Oh! Call an ambulance!

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,883
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.

27
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:17,098
Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,552
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.

29
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:20,841
What's wrong? What's the matter?

30
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:23,680
Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try...

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,848
Here, have some water. Water!

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,991
Here, drink this.

33
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,705
Shh! Shh!

34
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,823
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am

35
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:35,130
that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,945
Wait for it.

37
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:41,088
28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,288
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.

39
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,622
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story.

40
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:49,282
But I'll get to that later.

41
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:53,352
Still, you know, another year older. Still single.

42
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:56,092
You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?

43
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,967
Nope. I hit the snooze button.

44
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,130
And here come the paramedics.

45
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,892
Oh, thank God, you're here.

46
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,073
What is going on?!

47
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,661
I think there might be some internal bleeding.

48
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,223
Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.

49
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:09,360
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,773
- You've had a terrible fall.
- No, I haven't.

51
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:14,861
Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.

52
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:16,225
Angel...

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,428
Give him your number. What?

54
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,910
Give him your number. What?

55
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,710
- Give him your number.
- Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,407
- Give him your number.
- What are you...? Come on.

57
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:33,496
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.

58
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,757
- All right!
- It works!

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,162
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,585
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.

61
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,932
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun.

62
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,860
It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys.

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,975
Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.

64
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:59,413
I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle.

65
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,603
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.

66
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,831
Well, what's perfect?

67
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,921
- It's not like I have a list.
- Oh, yes, you do.

68
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:08,283
Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...

69
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:10,022
- That's not hard. I know at least...
- I'm not done.

70
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,283
She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.

71
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:16,753
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.

72
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:20,081
That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.

73
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,788
Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.

74
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,843
Any Kim from any cool band, really.

75
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,025
Can't be too picky.

76
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,790
You're never going to find this girl.

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,552
Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.

78
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:32,011
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.

79
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,830
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?

80
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,468
That's the plan.

81
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,591
And little did I know, at that very moment, fate--

82
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:45,702
in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer--

83
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:47,546
was taking care of it.

84
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,960
Whoa, you're up early.

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,173
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.

86
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:57,140
Does Marshall know?

87
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,038
He's still sound asleep.

88
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,768
Awesome.

89
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,953
So awesome.

90
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,240
God! Best girl ever.

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,991
Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.

92
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,556
Please don't do that.

93
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,696
Hey, is this milk any good?

94
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,593
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.

95
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:27,605
God, why didn't you throw it away?

96
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,447
I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.

97
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,937
Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.

98
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,228
What's wrong, baby?

99
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,541
This is the high point of my day.

100
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,643
It was true.

101
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:48,496
See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment.

102
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,980
But he needed money for the wedding,

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,785
so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm...

104
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,973
and he hated every minute of it.

105
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:58,453
Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.

106
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:00,698
Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.

107
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:04,021
I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.

108
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,885
Just take a look, will ya?

109
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,996
Okay, corner office. Top floor.

110
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,325
Check out that guy.

111
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,373
Name's Clark Butterfield.

112
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,822
He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West

113
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:21,080
and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.

114
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,345
So?

115
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,333
So guess what I did to that sandwich?

116
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,775
Here, I took a picture.

117
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:32,287
Oh! Sweet Lord.

118
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:35,678
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.

119
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:48,965
Ooh! Duck!

120
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,967
That is sick!

121
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,260
Why would you do that?

122
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,913
Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.

123
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:00,856
- You?
- Totally.

124
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,068
Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.

125
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,691
What?

126
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:12,473
Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern.

127
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,330
This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule,

128
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,330
call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.

129
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,700
This is stupid.

130
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,022
Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.

131
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:26,965
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.

132
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,081
This is a job for me, Barney.

133
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,061
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.

134
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,506
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.

135
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,616
Tracy, could you come in here, please?

136
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,585
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.

137
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,540
Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...

138
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,165
I get it. Thank you, Tracy.

139
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,180
Hello?

140
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,381
Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?

141
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,283
Speaking.

142
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:06,782
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions.

143
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:09,110
You signed up for our services about six months ago.

144
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,130
Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.

145
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,573
Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling.

146
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,161
We found her, sir.

147
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,255
We found your soul mate.

148
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,948
I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?

149
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,643
Well, my firm bought out the company.

150
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:30,192
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate,

151
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:34,851
but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so...

152
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,407
here I am.

153
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,468
So I'm in good hands.

154
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,252
You found me a match?

155
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:44,451
There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.

156
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,753
No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.

157
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,690
She's not engaged. She's your soul mate.

158
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,447
Just read the file.

159
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,913
So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect.

160
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,331
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina,

161
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:06,103
she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword,

162
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:09,100
she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna,

163
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,470
her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding

164
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,876
and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.

165
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,725
All right, fine. Set it up.

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,630
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?

167
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,806
Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.

168
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,802
Tastes normal to me.

169
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,222
That's what I thought, too.

170
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,140
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.

171
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,505
Oh, God!

172
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:39,948
It got me as well.

173
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,400
Well, then why did you have me drink it?!

174
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,048
Because now... you're in.

175
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,926
Okay.

176
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,926
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.

177
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:56,827
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.

178
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:59,798
Let's make that bastard pay.

179
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,583
You think that we should brush our teeth first?

180
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,195
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

181
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:07,680
So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match.

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
I was so excited, I got there early.

183
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,795
But before it even started...

184
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:15,582
Lily?

185
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,393
Hey, Ted, are you busy?

186
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,648
Um... yes.

187
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:22,113
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.

188
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:26,772
Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?

189
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,520
What? What? No.

190
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,271
Can't you just call Marshall?

191
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,431
Marshall can't know about this.

192
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:36,730
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire,

193
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,975
and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.

194
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:43,371
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't, I'm waiting...

195
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,922
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?

196
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,032
No, drifter, no!

197
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,261
Come on, Lily.

198
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,177
But you see my point.

199
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:56,278
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.

200
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,545
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.

201
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,573
Oh, thank God.

202
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:12,340
I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?

203
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,020
Y es.

204
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,235
And was she okay about pushing it back?

205
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,062
Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?

206
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:20,296
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.

207
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:24,340
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.

208
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,408
I swear on Luke and Leia.

209
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,626
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.

210
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:35,560
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.

211
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,620
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.

212
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,422
Did you talk to Marshall about it?

213
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:45,787
He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.

214
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,983
So I spent my nights reading, painting,

215
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,292
setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...

216
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,812
That was you? Awesome!

217
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,493
I know! I just got in the zone and...

218
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,295
Not the point of the story.

219
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:05,910
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany,

220
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,911
and I found that art fellowship.

221
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:10,565
Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.

222
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,555
San Francisco.

223
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,761
But it's not like I'm going to do it.

224
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,058
The dates conflict with the wedding.

225
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:24,205
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

226
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,412
This was a way to find out.

227
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,088
And the interview is tonight.

228
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:29,688
In New Haven.

229
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,796
You don't want to get married.

230
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,365
Of course I want to get married.

231
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,950
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.

232
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,206
I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.

233
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,473
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.

234
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:53,981
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.

235
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,212
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.

236
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,777
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

237
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,156
Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts.

238
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,300
But I'm not any more.

239
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,480
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this.

240
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,086
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.

241
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:23,965
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

242
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:27,625
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.

243
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,456
It's okay. Look...

244
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,820
Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.

245
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,020
But why am I the only one?

246
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,790
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?

247
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,018
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.

248
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,055
All done.

249
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,293
Ted, let's go to New Haven.

250
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:58,053
Lily, don't do this to yourself.

251
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,370
I just need to know if I can get in.

252
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,412
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know,

253
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,742
and I can forget all about it, and get married.

254
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,430
Come on! It's an adventure.

255
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,195
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.

256
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:13,706
Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake.

257
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,893
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake

258
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,400
but you don't really know it's a mistake

259
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,905
and look back, and say, "Yep. That was a mistake."

261
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:27,323
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake,

262
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:31,042
because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.

263
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,285
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!

264
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:39,458
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.

265
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,223
Does any of this make sense to you?

266
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,766
I don't know. You said "mistake" a lot.

267
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:46,881
Lily, don't do this.

268
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:50,270
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out,

269
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,508
and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.

270
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,665
Forgive you for what? Lily.

271
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,528
Lily!

272
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:06,581
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.

273
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:10,150
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...

274
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,307
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.

275
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:17,257
And, also, I texted you the same thing.

276
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,580
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.

277
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,773
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.

278
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,888
No.

279
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,521
It's kind of an emergency.

280
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,468
What are you doing in Duchess County?

281
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,272
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?

282
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,653
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.

283
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,168
We're kind of swamped.

284
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:43,321
Is that Ted?

285
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,241
Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.

286
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,810
Don't you have a big date tonight?

287
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,723
Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.

288
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,165
So what are you doing in Duchess County?

289
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,227
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!

290
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,660
Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.

291
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,655
No!

292
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,163
Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.

293
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:05,160
No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank.

294
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,175
I'm not in Duchess County.

295
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,285
So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?

296
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,958
Yep. Gotcha! Classic!

297
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,197
Gotta go.

298
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,875
Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.

299
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,883
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people

300
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,991
who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.

301
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:32,245
Which is great, and everything, but

302
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,825
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.

303
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,105
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?

304
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,417
Maybe.

305
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,646
Don't tell Lily, okay?

306
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:43,262
Taking off for the night.

307
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:44,841
Thanks, Tracy.

308
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,255
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?

309
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,885
Of course we are.

310
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,216
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.

311
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,947
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.

312
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:01,162
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.

313
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,800
Need a ride, cowboy?

314
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,852
Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.

315
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:07,316
Hmm, too bad. I got candy.

316
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,045
Candy?!

317
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,890
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing

318
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,023
by the side of a highway in Duchess County?

319
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,620
Nope. Sworn to secrecy.

320
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,183
Oh, come on.

321
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,747
- I like your hat.
- Right.

322
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:23,742
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.

323
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:26,445
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?

324
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,837
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.

325
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,641
I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,

326
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,812
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.

327
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,493
- Oh. I gotta see this.
- No way.

328
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,763
Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.

329
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:46,108
I bet it looks grr-eat!

330
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:50,966
So, she says, changing the subject.

331
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,446
Big date tonight.

332
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:55,106
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?

333
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,293
Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.

334
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,933
Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.

335
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,332
Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check.

336
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,930
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.

337
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,485
I read that.

338
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:11,548
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."

339
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,653
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.

340
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,423
We're not indoors. We're in a van.

341
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,172
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.

342
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,233
Never. What else?

343
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,283
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.

344
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:26,005
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.

345
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,678
What else?

346
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,886
Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.

347
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,520
And she's looking to get married and have kids?

348
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,261
Check and check. She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.

349
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,666
Wow.

350
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,381
You know, I've been thinking about this.

351
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:44,630
I think I want to have zero kids.

352
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,388
Really? You don't want kids?

353
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,745
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.

354
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,667
Hey. I'm driving.

355
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,111
Look at that. 8:56. You're early.

356
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,210
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

357
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,753
Good luck on your date.

358
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:07,308
I hope she's everything you're looking for.

359
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,686
Thanks.

360
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:16,337
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.

361
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,661
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh,

362
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:20,990
here's what I'm going to do.

363
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,480
You're going to show me your hair?

364
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,565
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.

365
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:38,238
You just made my night.

366
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,177
Go.

367
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:44,281
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package,

368
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,925
and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.

369
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,796
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.

370
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,427
Hi.

371
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:53,827
Hey.

372
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:58,285
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?

373
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:02,926
Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.

374
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:06,795
You think you might want to... drink the milk?

375
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,605
No.

376
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,045
Nope, I'm good.

377
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:13,365
I don't need any milk.

378
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,160
Look, guys, I know milk is important--

379
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,940
it's got vitamin A, vitamin D,

380
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,851
it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.

381
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,497
How'd it go, dude?

382
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:28,366
I didn't go.

383
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,863
What? Why?

384
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,455
I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.

385
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,865
Why? She sounds perfect.

386
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,685
I don't want perfect.

387
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:38,877
I want Robin.

388
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,423
Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.

389
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:44,688
Maybe.

390
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:47,743
But it's a mistake I have to make.

391
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,463
Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence.

392
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,001
You and Robin have tried this again and again...

393
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,711
Here's the thing about mistakes.

394
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:58,620
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake,

395
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,456
you gotta make it anyway.

396
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,280
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.

397
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,935
Hey, is this milk any good?

398
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:14,217
Even really really dumb mistakes.

1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,596
It was May of 2006 in New York City

2
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:18,119
and life was good.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,334
But everything was about to change.

4
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:24,349
So... what do you think?

5
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,457
Robin again?

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:33,085
Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together.

7
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,250
Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.

8
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,611
But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?

9
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:45,295
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills.

10
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:47,551
Anybody else get chills?

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,460
Look, I realize we've been down this road before,

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,063
but the fact is, whatever I do,

13
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:56,927
it all keeps coming back to Robin, so...

14
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,703
I gotta do this.

15
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,840
Ow! What the hell?

16
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:04,321
That wasn't me. That was the universe.

17
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:10,000
The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something--

18
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,401
a storm.

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,442
And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday.

20
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,171
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.

21
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,150
So don't step in a poodle.

22
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,583
Sandy? Robin?

23
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,750
Thanks, Lou.

24
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:26,851
Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.

25
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

26
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,651
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

27
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,872
And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.

28
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,380
Have a great night.

29
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,300
And, we're clear.

30
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:41,480
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.

31
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:44,533
Well, I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again,

32
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,523
but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.

33
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:50,683
Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight.

34
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:53,770
The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end

35
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:56,051
really got my freak juice flowing.

36
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,161
Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash

37
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,091
and burn before you say, "enough"?

38
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,110
One more. One more time.

39
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,582
One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture.

40
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:09,382
And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it.

41
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:10,793
If it's yes, great.

42
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,131
If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.

43
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:17,630
So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?

44
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,873
I am going to make her...

45
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,621
a mix CD.

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,340
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

47
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,262
Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.

48
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,892
I see where this is going.

49
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,710
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work...

50
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,082
usually.

51
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,220
The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999.

52
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:40,953
The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...

53
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,771
Universe.

54
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,990
So, this plan you speak of?

55
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,792
Remember the first night Robin and I went out?

56
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:52,470
I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.

57
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,971
Yeah. Dude, that was awesome,

58
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:57,261
but how are you ever going to top that?

59
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,753
She should be here any second.

60
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,411
Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?

61
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,703
Enough with the-- we'll go get pizza later, all right?

62
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,141
Just...

63
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:26,852
Damn it.

64
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:33,850
Hello.

65
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:38,242
Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.

66
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,121
Extra key?

67
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,351
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

68
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,733
Yes, I gave it to you.

69
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,641
Oh, right. That key.

70
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,252
Yeah, I lost it.

71
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,520
Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.

72
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:52,621
No, wait, uh...

73
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,682
Maybe you should just knock.

74
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,081
Knock?

75
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,641
Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.

76
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:08,683
Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco.

77
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,531
I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship.

78
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,691
We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.

79
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,182
Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?

80
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,831
Summer fellowship?

81
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,581
Just knock.

82
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,983
Okay.

83
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,101
Hi.

84
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,310
Hi.

85
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,563
Robin...

86
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:47,982
I've sort of said this already.

87
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:51,962
I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly.

88
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,992
So this is me, just saying it.

89
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,972
With strings.

90
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,552
I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together.

91
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,532
What do you say?

92
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,651
- What do you say?
- Yes.

93
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:15,881
No.

94
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,461
I don't know.

95
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,143
Those are the three options.

96
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,212
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

97
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:26,912
I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and...

98
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,832
I have to pee.

99
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:34,290
Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.

101
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:49,933
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.

102
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,740
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

103
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:57,781
Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.

104
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,112
Sure.

105
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,281
We're not getting any pizza.

106
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:07,881
Okay. Let's talk.

107
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,222
Okay.

108
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,611
Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?

109
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,791
Thanks, guys. Just need a minute.

110
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,140
Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though.

111
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,872
Kind of an inside joke.

112
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,220
Thanks.

113
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:29,182
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.

114
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,643
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

115
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,991
You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay?

116
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,201
We only just started being friends again.

117
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:39,001
I know. But-- come on.

118
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,691
And we want different things.

119
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,071
That's still there. That's not going away.

120
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,322
I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out

121
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,560
and I'd lose you as a friend?

122
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,291
I gotta think about this.

123
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,701
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

124
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,783
Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious.

125
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,282
I'm kidding. I'm serious.

126
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:57,732
I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.

127
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,060
I thought that thing was canceled.

128
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,110
Well, it's back on.

129
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,022
Since when?

130
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,842
Since like an hour ago.

131
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,441
..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic.

132
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:09,670
So it's blue skies this weekend.

133
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,092
Sandy? Robin?

134
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:16,500
Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud.

135
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:21,261
I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One.

136
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:23,750
It has been an honor to bring you the news each night,

137
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,332
and read the paper to you each morning.

138
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,432
I will always treasure it.

139
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,043
Good night, New York.

140
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,871
And we're clear.

141
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,270
You're leaving?

142
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,622
There. I quit my job.

143
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:39,192
We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me?

144
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,973
Oh, congratulations.

146
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,956
Congratulations yourself.

147
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:46,952
What do you mean?

148
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:51,410
Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor.

149
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:53,222
I told him you.

150
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,661
They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.

151
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,240
Wow.

152
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,170
Thanks.

153
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,611
And, yes.

154
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,812
Yes, what?

155
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,781
Yes, let's go get dinner.

156
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:09,373
How about this weekend on the camping trip?

157
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,500
I roast a mean weenie.

158
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,222
Oh, you're kidding me.

159
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,142
No way. Don't go on this thing.

160
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,830
Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.

161
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,491
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date.

162
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,192
With Sandy... and his weenie.

163
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,500
I mean is this not a date?

164
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,291
I don't-I don't know.

165
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,980
So, what? You actually like this guy now?

166
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,572
I don't know.

167
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,752
Are you gonna hook up with him?

168
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:35,722
I don't know.

169
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,843
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

170
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,853
And you know what? That's okay.

171
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,813
I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.

172
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,372
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really? What is all of this?

173
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:50,162
I mean, why can't you just say, "Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"

174
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:55,143
No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates

175
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,871
and let's spend the rest of our lives together.

176
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,732
Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point?

177
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,930
God, you are so terrified of anything real.

178
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,873
It's like you're floating out in space.

179
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,852
Touch the ground, Robin.

180
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,821
Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.

181
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,803
I need to think about this.

182
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,130
Fine.

183
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,323
No, I'm sorry, I...

184
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,171
I can't do this anymore.

185
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:19,840
I need an answer.

186
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:25,413
If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.

187
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,383
Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.

188
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,492
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

189
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,693
Nice try, buddy.

190
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,841
Good hustle out there.

191
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,013
Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure.

192
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:47,092
She's made her choice and you can finally move on.

193
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,881
Screw that. This ain't over.

194
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:53,452
Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...

195
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,513
I don't care what I said.

196
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:58,422
This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be.

197
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,420
It is meant to be, and you know why?

198
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,650
'Cause I mean it to be.

199
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,910
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

200
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,531
Let's pause.

201
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:13,081
See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight

202
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,842
they could pause and take a break.

203
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,072
Their fights often lasted for days.

204
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,291
- A painting fellowship?
- I was never going to take it.

205
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,143
- In California?
- I was never going to take it.

206
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:25,102
Ted, she is going on that camping trip.

207
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:30,380
Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.

208
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,572
Fine.

209
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:35,443
If an act of God is what it takes,

210
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,683
then an act of God it is.

211
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,553
What are you talking about?

212
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,142
I'm gonna make it rain.

213
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,031
I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

214
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,531
So how do I keep that from happening?

215
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,973
Simple-- I make it rain!

216
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,973
Ted, do you want me to slap you again?

217
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:59,103
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

218
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,991
Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what?

219
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,741
I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan.

220
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,513
That girl you used to go out with, Penelope,

221
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,061
wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?

222
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:08,822
Yeah.

223
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:09,931
Are you still in touch with her?

224
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,152
Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex,

225
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:14,571
we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up,

226
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,373
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

227
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,572
Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her.

228
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,392
She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.

229
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,571
- Did you just say a "rain dance"?
- Yes.

230
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:28,201
- A rain dance.
- Yes.

231
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:31,982
- A dance to make it rain.
- Yes.

232
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,073
- We're finding Penelope!
- No, we are not!

233
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,032
Yes, we are!

234
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:46,581
Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!

235
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:49,423
Why the hell should I help you?

236
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:54,741
Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.

237
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:58,023
We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me.

238
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,453
How is that a relationship?

239
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:01,951
Twice!

240
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:05,170
- Barney, there is no way...
- Shh!

241
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:07,160
Seriously, come on.

242
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,393
Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.

243
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,770
Why?

244
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:14,560
There's this girl...

245
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,323
"There's this girl."

246
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:20,393
You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature.

247
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:25,473
I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.

248
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:27,102
Penelope, this is the girl I love.

249
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:30,273
If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.

250
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,802
Please.

251
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:36,740
This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?

252
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,722
Absolutely.

253
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,181
- Kind of like Barney?
- Kind of.

254
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,951
- Hey.
- You hit on my mom!

255
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,803
We weren't exclusive!

256
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:45,963
I'm in.

257
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,803
And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.

258
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:49,973
Okay.

259
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:52,571
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.

260
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,610
Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.

261
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,482
I will throw you off this roof.

262
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,610
There's so much of your mom in you.

263
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:06,041
And she's been throwing up ever since.

264
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:08,683
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?

265
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:12,250
Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about?

266
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,183
Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment

267
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,670
with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...

268
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,540
Oh, that's so sweet.

269
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy?

270
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:28,811
I mean, a string quartet in my living room-- who does that?

271
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,113
Nobody does that.

272
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,262
Exactly.

273
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,410
No, honey-- nobody does that.

274
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,521
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

275
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,121
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.

276
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,053
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?

277
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,833
Forbid? Who said forbid?

278
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:50,983
I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months,

279
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:52,872
and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day.

280
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:55,530
Look for me-- I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.

281
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,241
Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.

282
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:03,092
Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them.

283
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.

284
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:12,401
So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it" to "I need to do this"?

285
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,450
Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?

286
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,350
Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.

287
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,332
I never said that!

288
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:19,962
You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now,

289
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,431
what's gonna change in three months?

290
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:22,741
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.

291
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,152
Maybe not.

292
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:28,130
- Pause.
- Pause.

293
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,523
- So, are you just, like, starving?
- Totally.

294
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,860
Red Lobster?

295
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:37,122
Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!

296
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,661
Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it.

297
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:43,141
Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.

298
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,922
I wouldn't dare.

299
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,380
Marshall, no. We're on pause.

300
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,830
There's no crying in Pauseland!

301
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,041
Pauseland is a magical place, with--

302
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,741
with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers!

303
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,093
Damn it!

304
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,641
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday,

305
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:04,170
happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday,

306
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,402
happy, happy...

307
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,652
Ted, this is funny.

308
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,720
Still funny.

309
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,720
Still fu... And now it's sad.

310
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:25,340
Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?

311
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,633
I think so.

312
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,461
Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?

313
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,100
I think so.

314
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:37,762
Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?

315
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,362
No.

316
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,171
No?

317
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,770
I've read extensively on the subject:

318
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,542
firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...

319
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,851
Have you ever seen a rain dance?

320
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,371
I've seen a film strip.

321
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,083
Terrific. Uh, look, I should run.

322
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R.

323
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,341
I can't believe this.

324
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,461
We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.

325
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,782
What do you mean "we," white man?

326
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,301
How did we get here?

327
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,323
Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was,

328
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,672
did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.

329
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,593
I think there's still one left.

330
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,222
Dibs.

331
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,361
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

332
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,511
Look... I know this sucks.

333
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,221
It's just something I'm going through.

334
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,763
I'm not asking you to understand it.

335
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,211
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

336
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,271
I'm just asking you to support it.

337
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,941
I want to, Lily, okay?

338
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:47,782
I really do.

339
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,841
But I just can't.

340
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:50,530
Why not?

341
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:53,463
Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not.

342
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,582
What if you decide to go be a painter

343
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,682
and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore,

344
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,891
and three months becomes forever?

345
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,571
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

346
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,921
Marshall...

347
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:06,081
'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now.

348
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:09,342
I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.

349
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,880
Marshall, I love you.

350
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,642
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

351
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,901
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

352
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,731
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!

353
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,760
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?!

354
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,433
That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.

355
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,630
Thank you.

356
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,491
Hey, Ted.

357
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,310
Whatcha doing?

358
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,973
A rain dance.

359
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:46,751
Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

360
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:50,090
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography.

361
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,953
It's the thought that counts.

362
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,741
She's leaving in half an hour.

363
00:17:56,755 --> 00:18:00,413
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl.

364
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,790
This isn't gonna work!

365
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,510
Yeah. I know that.

366
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,613
- Well, then why are you doing this?
- Because I love her.

367
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:07,980
I love her!

368
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,542
I told her that the first night we went out,

369
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,592
and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed.

370
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,661
So yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

371
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,700
But it has to work!

372
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,060
You hear me, universe?

373
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,812
This is Ted Mosby talking!

374
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,910
Give me some rain!

375
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,361
Come on!

376
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,151
Come on!

377
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,943
Come on...!

378
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,603
Oh, come on!

379
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:54,233
Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area

380
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:58,380
and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.

381
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,973
How about that? He did it.

382
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,812
Robin! Hey, Robin!

383
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,963
Oh, thank God you're here!

384
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,151
My camping trip got rained out.

385
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,960
I know. I'm sorry.

386
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,800
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

387
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,081
Come down here.

388
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,232
It's pouring. You come up.

389
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,412
No, you have to come down here.

390
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,931
- Why?
- Why?

391
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,163
Because I made it rain, that's what I did today!

392
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:55,582
And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!

393
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,641
I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.

394
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.

395
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:03,661
You have to come down here!

396
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,441
- I was gonna...
- I know.

397
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,900
And that's how Robin and I ended up together.

398
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:48,960
Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain.

399
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:52,192
As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same,

400
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:55,220
the people looked the same. It all looked the same.

401
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:56,742
But it wasn't.

402
00:20:56,746 --> 00:21:00,320
In just one night, everything had changed.

403
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:37,181
