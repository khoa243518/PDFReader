inside we put up a Christmas tree some
years we have a real tree real pine

34
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,380
trees smell nice

35
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,250
but you have to be careful that they
don't dry out and start a fire

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,260
this year we have an artificial tree we
hang tinsel and ornaments on the tree

we place gifts under the tree there is a
gift for me under the tree

on Christmas morning

45
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,630
it is exciting to see what Santa has
left for you

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,230
my mother will make a big turkey dinner
for us on Christmas Day

47
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,850

tasting foods to go with the turkey

48

we will have dessert to some of my
family like Christmas pudding but i will

49
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,540
just have ice cream last year some
carolers came to the door

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,489
it was snowing outside they stood in the
snow and saying Christmas carols to us

51
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,750
my father gave them some money and my
mother gave them some hot chocolate to

52
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,970
warm them up they had lovely voices and
they saying some of my favorite carols

53
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,40
we also collect food gifts and money for
some of the people in town who cannot

54
00:03:40,40 --> 00:03:41,840
afford to have Christmas

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,350
my family is collecting things for a
poor family who live near here

56
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,000
we had fun deciding which toys to buy
for the children in that family

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,260
it was a good feeling to share with
people who do not have as much as you do

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,179
my parents have always taught us that
christmas is a time for giving not

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,40
receiving I think that

60
00:04:01,40 --> 00:04:04,40
right

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,769
the garden

62
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,800
the garden is very interesting

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,920
I sometimes go outside and i watch all
the things that go on in the garden

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,520
it smells wonderful in the flower garden

65
00:04:24,30 --> 00:04:30,419
there are red white pink and yellow
roses that have a sweet smell

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,489
i watch the bees as they take pollen
from the roses

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,510
there are tiny bugs that live on the
rose bushes

68
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,780
my mother tries to get rid of the little
bugs but it is difficult to get rid of

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,500
them

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,480
she is glad to see the red lady bugs who
eat the little bugs the birds like the

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,710
sunflowers

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,620
they like to eat sunflower seeds there
is a bird bath in the garden

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,750
the Blackbirds and swallows go in there
to take a drink or have a bath

74
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,700
I sometimes see a Robin or a blue jay in
there too

75
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,420
in the dirt there are little holes where
the ants go in and out

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,250
the ants are hard workers i watch them
as they work together as a team to bring

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,930
food to their nests there are snails in
the garden -

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,830
they carry their homes on their backs
they move slowly and leave a silvery

79
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,109
trail as they go they eat the leaves
from my mother's plants

80
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,670
my mother also has vegetables growing in
her garden

81
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,380
she grows green peas we like to pick
those and eat the peas raw right out of

82
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,580
their pods

83
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,580
she grows lettuce and tomatoes -

84
00:06:00,90 --> 00:06:05,369
we have so many tomatoes that we always
give some to our neighbors

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,530
my mother sends us outside to pick
lettuce and tomatoes

86
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:17,669
whenever we have a salad my favorite
vegetables are carrots their tops grow

87
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,240
above the earth

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,550
but the carrots are below the dirt when
you pick them you have to pull the

89
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:32,80
carrots out from under the soil weeds
also grow in the garden after a good

90
00:06:32,80 --> 00:06:33,219
rain fall

91
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,490
it seems that the weeds just spring up

92
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,509
I pull the weeds out by their roots so
they won't grow back

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,90
weeds choke the good plants so we don't
want them in our garden

94
00:06:46,90 --> 00:06:54,638
gardening is a good hobby you get fresh
air sunshine and exercise you even get

95
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
beautiful colorful flowers and nice
fresh food

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,950
the pet store

97
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,979
on Saturday my parents took us to the
pet store

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,80
they had everything that you would need
if you had a pet

99
00:07:25,80 --> 00:07:32,490
they had dog food collars and leashes
for dogs they had treats to give your

100
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:40,620
dog and brushes to brush your dog for
cats they had food toys and litter boxes

101
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,910
for birds they had seed and cages

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,190
there was a section for fish they had
fish in big tanks and little bowls in

103
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,450
the big tanks

104
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,270
there were colorful fish swimming around
the girl who worked there said that they

105
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,120
were tropical fish there were gold fish
in the smaller fish bowls

106
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,560
I saw the girl get a goldfish out with a
little net

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,160
she sold it to a boy who said he had
another goldfish at home there was a

108
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,520
very large cage with a parrot in it

109
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,270
I walked up to the cage and the parents
said hello

110
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,929
I was surprised that the parrot could
talk

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,490
it could say a few things it said I love
you

112
00:08:33,30 --> 00:08:39,839
pretty bird and bye bye I told my mother
that I would like a parrot

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,470
but she said that parents need a lot of
care and attention at the back of the

114
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,310
store

115
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,910
there were some puppies they seemed glad
to see me

116
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,170
I stuck my hand into the cage and one of
them licked my hand

117
00:08:56,40 --> 00:09:03,30
they were very lively they were running
around and chasing their own tails in

118
00:09:03,30 --> 00:09:04,290
the next cage

119
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,770
there were two kittens one of them was
playing with a toy and the other one was

120
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,730
asleep

121
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,820
the kittens were very small the one that
was sleeping was curled up into a ball

122
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,410
I couldn't even see her face

123
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,629
I didn't want to leave the pet store I
was wishing that I could take all of the

124
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,629
animals home with me

125
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,370
my first day of school

126
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,730
I remember my first day of school

127
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,000
I was excited but I was afraid I held my
mother's hand as we walk to the school

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
when we got near the school

129
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,400
I wouldn't let her hold my hand anymore
I didn't want to look like a baby

130
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,319
we got to the school the school looked
very big and frightening

131
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,490
there were children outside on the
playground

132
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:15,660
they all looked very big I looked at
them and some of them looked at me I

133
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,579
felt very small

134
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,680
my mother and I went into the school and
found the kindergarten room

135
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,620
there were children in their most of
them were the same size as me

136
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,470
my mother spoke to the kindergarten
teacher the teacher was very nice

137
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,60
she said my name and she introduced me
to some of the other children

138
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,400
I already knew some of the children
because they lived near me

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,140
I began to play with some of the things
that were in the classroom

140
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,540
there were tight rucks coloring books
and even a dull house

141
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,490
I soon forgot to be scared and I began
to play with the other children

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,690
I didn't even notice that my mother had
left the room

143
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,980
in school we sang songs played some
games and listened as the teacher read

144
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,89
us a story

145
00:11:12,89 --> 00:11:15,89
I had a lot of fun on my first day of
school

146
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,199
I even drew a picture of my teacher

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,370
I took the picture home and my mother
put it on the refrigerator

148
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,20
I like school it is a good place to meet
new friends and learn all about the

149
00:11:31,20 --> 00:11:34,20
world

150
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,780
transportation

151
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,529
people move from place to place there
are lots of ways you can move around

152
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,200
from one place to another

153
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,410
sometimes you can just move your feet
and walk walking is good for you

154
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:07,550
some places are too far to walk to you
might have to ride a bicycle or ride on

155
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,170
a skateboard

156
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:15,290
some places are too far away to ride
your bicycle to you might have to drive

157
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,610
in a car or a van or even a truck

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,940
my father has a car my uncle has a van

159
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,709
I have never been in a big truck trucks
are usually used to carry big loads from

160
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,540
one city to another

161
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,599
I would like to be a truck driver

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,670
I would travel all over and sit high up
in the cab

163
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,729
I have been in a taxicab

164
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,630
once my mother and i took a taxi to the
hospital

165
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,440
there was a special meter in the taxi
when we finished our taxi ride the

166
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,240
driver looked at the meter to find out
how much money we owed him

167
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,610
I once rode a horse i sat in the saddle
and held on tight to the reins the horse

168
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,440
ran very fast

169
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,60
it was a bumpy ride and I was afraid
that I would fall off the horse

170
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,980
not too many people around here use
horses for transportation

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,000
they used to use horses for
transportation in the old days if you

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,520
want to travel very far away

173
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,600
you have to go on a train a plane or a
boat

174
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,949
if you are in a hurry it is best to take
a plane planes fly through the air

175
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,880
very fast trains go along the tracks

176
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:54,209
sometimes I can hear the train whistle
from my house boats take a long time to

177
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,919
cross the ocean

178
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,720
great big boats that cross the oceans
are called ships

179
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,289
if you like to take it easy and look out
at the water than ships are a good way

180
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,609
to travel

181
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:15,449
they say that the world is a lot smaller
now because of Transportation people can

182
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:19,378
travel to all parts of the world quickly
and easily

183
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,399
the world is not really smaller but it
has become easy to get to faraway places

184
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,470
television

185
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,270
do you watch television my mother says
that i watch too much television

186
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,560
i watch cartoons on saturday mornings

187
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,979
cartoons make me laugh my brother and I
each have our favorite cartoons

188
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:07,240
we have trouble deciding which cartoons
we will watch on Saturday afternoons we

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,220
like to watch sports

190
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,710
my brother really likes to watch
baseball but usually my mother tells us

191
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,890
to go out and play on a Saturday
afternoon on weeknights

192
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,980
we have our own favorite shows I like
shows about outer space and monsters

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,810
my brother likes comedies he likes to
laugh my mother like shows about real

194
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,459
life situations

195
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,580
she likes to watch the news she says
that the news is important

196
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,170
she watches the news and weather to find
out what is going on in the world

197
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,900
sometimes she watches real-life shows
about doctors or policemen

198
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,829
my father doesn't watch television

199
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,720
he says that he would rather read a good
book or the newspaper

200
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,620
my dad gets all his news from the
newspaper

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,90
my favorite thing is to sit in front of
the television with a bag of popcorn and

202
00:16:13,90 --> 00:16:18,430
a bottle of pop I sit there and change
the channels with the remote control

203
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,50
I change channels and watch a few
different shows at once

204
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,710
my mother won't let me watch too much
television

205
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,460
she doesn't want me to get lazy
television is good if you don't spend

206
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,410
too much time watching it you can learn
a lot from television

207
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:44,770
if you watch the educational channels I
learned about dinosaurs and rainforest

208
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,790
last week

209
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,790
just from watching television

210
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,449
my country

211
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,898
i live in canada it is a very large
country that is made up of ten provinces

212
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,658
and three territories

213
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:18,600
most of the provinces and territories
are quite unique for example in

214
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,859
Saskatchewan

215
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,309
the land is flat and it is not
surrounded by water

216
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,970
they grow wheat in Saskatchewan British
Columbia has mountains

217
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,590
I have never been to British Columbia
but I hear that it is very beautiful

218
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,518
nova scotia is on the Atlantic Ocean

219
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,428
so there are many fishermen out there
the people in the provinces are even

220
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:50,669
different from each other in Quebec many
of the people speak french in the

221
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,460
Maritime Provinces the people like to
play their own kind of music they play

222
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,720
fiddles and accordions and many of them
dance very well known of it is in the

223
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,590
north

224
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,899
so life is quite different they're the
people who live in the new territory of

225
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,899
Nunavut are very close to wildlife

226
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,340
they do a lot of hunting and fishing it
can get very cold up in the Arctic where

227
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:28,289
none of it is i live in ontario even
within Ontario life can be quite

228
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,279
different

229
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:36,419
the capital of ontario is toronto
toronto is a very busy city with lots of

230
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,600
apartments offices and shops

231
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,709
toronto is an exciting place and it has
a lot to offer

232
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,459
there are theaters and restaurants to
suit every taste the culture in toronto

233
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,559
is very diverse

234
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,928
if you drive a few miles north of
Toronto you will find places that are

235
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:04,710
tranquil and peaceful many people leave
Toronto on the weekends and drive to

236
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,889
their cottages where they find rest and
relaxation

237
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,659
canada is made up of many different
cultures

238
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,80
people of many different ethnic
backgrounds live in harmony in Canada

239
00:19:19,80 --> 00:19:24,750
that is why i like Canada in Canada we
celebrate our differences

240
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,168
food

241
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,619
what kind of food do you like to eat

242
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,389
I am lucky because in Canada there are
many foods to choose from

243
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:51,39
I like to eat hot dogs hamburgers &
steak

244
00:19:51,609 --> 00:20:00,39
these are all meat products i also like
cheese ice cream and yogurt these are

245
00:20:00,39 --> 00:20:02,289
all dairy products

246
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:10,59
I like vegetables my favorite vegetables
are broccoli cabbage carrots and peas

247
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:19,119
I eat a lot of fruit I eat which ever
fruit is in season in strawberry season

248
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,480
I eat a lot of strawberries in peach
season

249
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:30,249
I eat many peaches sometimes my mother
will make a peach pie many different

250
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:36,639
crops grow in canada we have many
orchards and farms fresh fruit and

251
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:43,748
vegetables are plentiful in Canada meat
and fish are also plentiful here in

252
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:49,840
canada we have a lot of different foods
to choose from in my city there are a

253
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,238
lot of Italian restaurants

254
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:56,559
my favorite food at the italian
restaurant is pizza

255
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,730
my parents would rather have spaghetti
or lasagna

256
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,230
there are Greek restaurants mexican
restaurants and chinese restaurants in

257
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,590
fact there are restaurants from most
cultures

258
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,139
I can go around from restaurant to
restaurant and pretend that I am

259
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,580
traveling the world and trying all the
different foods from around the world

260
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,600
sometimes I eat things that aren't good
for me

261
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,389
I eat potato chips and candies these
foods aren't part of a nutritious diet

262
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,389
but they are fun to eat

263
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,870
the zoo

264
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,260
my class took a trip to the Toronto Zoo

265
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,870
I

266
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,909
I had a wonderful time they're my
favorite animals were the Lions

267
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,120
they look very powerful and strong

268
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,510
they say that the lion is the king of
the forest and I think that title suits

269
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,379
him

270
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,290
the monkeys were funny they were looking
at us just as much as we looked at them

271
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,720
they were swinging from branches and
doing tricks to impress us

272
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,980
there was a baby monkey that was
clinging to its mother's back

273
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,440
it was very cute the Tigers were pacing
back and forth

274
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,290
they seemed Restless the stripes on a
tiger are very beautiful

275
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:42,10
we watched the toll giraffes as they
nibbled leaves off the tallest trees

276
00:22:42,10 --> 00:22:49,210
we spoke to a colorful parrot that spoke
back to us we saw exotic animals that we

277
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,70
had never seen before

278
00:22:51,70 --> 00:22:56,320
some of them were very strange there
were different types of bears they're

279
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,780
there were black bears

280
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,809
I saw a black bear once when I was
camping up north we saw polar bears

281
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,649
polar bears are white they like the cold

282
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,220
we even saw panda bears one of my
friends bought a toy panda bear from the

283
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,120
gift shop because she thought that the
pandas were so cute

284
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,630
we saw slippery snakes some of the
snakes had very bright skins

285
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:31,270
most of the girls were afraid of the
snakes the zookeeper was looking after

286
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,840
the snakes and one of them hissed at him
he has to be very careful when he works

287
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,980
with the snakes

288
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,570
the last thing that we saw at the zoo
was the elephant

289
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,870
he was enormous he looked at us

290
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,660
then he raised his trunk and made a loud
sound it made us jump

291
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
the museum

292
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,50
the museum was very interesting there
were so many things in the museum that I

293
00:24:13,50 --> 00:24:16,800
would need more time to really see
everything

294
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,200
there were clothes from the past I don't
know how people wore some of those

295
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,230
things they look like they would be
uncomfortable

296
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,340
I like to wear my jeans

297
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,850
there were things from Wars there were
bullets and cannons and even uniforms

298
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,350
from the soldiers

299
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:43,590
I don't think that war is a good thing
but it is good to remember the past and

300
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,919
honor the people who died for your
country

301
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,920
there was an old fire truck at the
Museum this fire truck was pulled by a

302
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,940
horse

303
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,890
there were some very old photographs of
the firemen putting out fires

304
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,960
there were rooms in the museum that were
set up like an old house

305
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,280
there were antique irons and sewing
machines

306
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,120
the women used to clean the clothes with
a washboard

307
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,139
there were no modern appliances back
then

308
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm glad that we have electricity and
modern appliances the things that we

309
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,560
have make life so much easier

310
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,340
there were mummies from Egypt at the
Museum

311
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,370
I was fascinated by those there were
artifacts from the Indians

312
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,439
there were arrowheads and cradles that
the babies slept in

313
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,970
I tried my best to see everything but it
was almost impossible

314
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,460
the museum is a good place to learn
about your past

315
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,410
I tried to imagine my grandparents using
some of the things that were on display

316
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,410
at the Museum

317
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
the police

318
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,540
my mother always told me that if I was
lost I could go up to a policeman and

319
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,000
that he would help me to find my way
home I never did get lost

320
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,620
but I always remembered what my mother
told me about the police

321
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,580
I think policeman look very nice in
their uniforms

322
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,570
I see police officers drive by in their
police cars in my town

323
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:48,429
we even have police officers on bicycles
policeman and police women have a job

324
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,190
that can sometimes be dangerous

325
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,190
they have to catch people who break the
law

326
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:01,600
sometimes they have to chase people or
try to calm people down to be a police

327
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,500
officer

328
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,140
you need a lot of training it's
important to be able to deal with people

329
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,250
effectively a police officer came to our
school

330
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,970
he had a police dog with him

331
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,930
the officer showed us how the dog could
track down criminals

332
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,930
the dog was very smart he could even
find things that were hidden

333
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,230
criminals sometimes hide things that
they don't want the police to find the

334
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,610
policeman told us that he and his dog
were partners

335
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,620
his dog lives at his house with the
policeman and his family

336
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,750
sometimes I see police cars on the side
of the road

337
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,000
the police stopped at people who are
speeding or are not wearing their

338
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,230
seatbelts

339
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,160
the police officers warn people or give
out tickets

340
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,390
sometimes they even have to arrest
people

341
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:09,220
police officers are just doing their job
when they arrest people some people need

342
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,20
to be arrested and put in jail to make
it safer for the rest of us

343
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:26,418
pretending

344
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,169
I like to pretend i like to make up
things that aren't real

345
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:34,159
I use my imagination I was pretending
that i was in a time machine

346
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,529
I set the date for a prehistoric time I
turned on the time machine and it buzzed

347
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,909
in Word and spud madly when it stopped
spinning i opened the door and stepped

348
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,129
out into a very thick jungle

349
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,359
I listened carefully to the sounds of
the jungle I could hear strange animal

350
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,830
noises and the leaves were rustling I
wasn't sure if I'd gone back in time or

351
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,830
just landed in a jungle somewhere in the
21st century

352
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,230
it didn't take me long to realize that I
had indeed gone back in time a very

353
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,950
strange bird-like creature with a large
beak flew overhead

354
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,779
I've never seen anything like it in my
life I took a few steps out into the

355
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,460
long grass and ferns

356
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I didn't want to go too far away from my
time machine

357
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,259
I heard a noise over on my right side
there was a man who looked quite

358
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,340
different from me

359
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,340
he was dressed in an animal skin and he
carried a big stick

360
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:29,149
I didn't want him to see me so I hid
behind a tree

361
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,379
he didn't speak any language that i
could understand he grunted at someone

362
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:35,238
who must have been in the distance

363
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,450
then I felt the earth shake beneath my
feet

364
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,559
I heard giant thumps on the ground as
the floor of the jungle shook the man

365
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,779
and the animal skin began to run

366
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,279
I saw why he was running a giant
dinosaur appeared above the tops of the

367
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,29
trees

368
00:29:50,29 --> 00:29:54,710
it was bigger than anything I'd ever
seen my heart began to pound my chest it

369
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,90
was coming toward me

370
00:29:56,90 --> 00:30:00,590
I ran toward my time machine and jumped
in I set the dial for the 21st century

371
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,90
the Machine word and buzzed my time
machine landed in the 21st century

372
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
I got away just in time

373
00:30:17,10 --> 00:30:19,450
a baby

374
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,309
my and just had a baby girl

375
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,999
we went to the hospital to visit my end
and to see the new baby

376
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,840
my aunt was feeling fine although she
was just a bit tired

377
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,759
she walked with us to a big window that
had lots of babies behind it

378
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,769
she pointed to a crib with a baby in it
the baby was wrapped in a pink blanket

379
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:42,639
we all said how pretty the baby looked I
couldn't believe how tiny the baby was

380
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:47,498
she was asleep so we couldn't see her
eyes when the baby went home

381
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:51,700
we went to visit her we heard the baby
she was crying

382
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,320
my aunt said the baby was hungry my aunt
had a baby bottle full of warm milk

383
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,320
she fed the baby with it the baby was
happy after that my and patted the baby

384
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,460
on the back until the baby burp and then
the baby fell asleep

385
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,289
I held the baby I looked at her tiny
fingers and tiny toes

386
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,340
I was very careful with her she opened
her eyes and looked at me

387
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,549
I spoke to the baby but I knew that she
could not understand me

388
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,330
babies have to learn to walk and talk

389
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,39
my aunt change the baby babies wear
diapers so they need to be changed often

390
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:32,769
the baby has a lot of toys but she is
still too young to play with them by and

391
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,999
says that it won't be long before the
baby is crawling and trying to talk

392
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:42,340
babies are cute I have seen pictures of
myself when I was a baby and it's hard

393
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
to believe that I was once that small

394
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,640
a wedding

395
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,380
the church bells are ringing I am inside
the church waiting for my cousin to walk

396
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,430
down the aisle

397
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:08,190
today is her wedding day she has a bride
the organist is playing a song on the

398
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,910
organ

399
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,420
we all stand up and watch my cousin walk
down the aisle

400
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,860
she is our man armed with her father she
is dressed in a long white dress and

401
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,879
veil

402
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,330
she looks so beautiful she looks like a
princess

403
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,350
the man who she is going to marry is
standing at the front of the church

404
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,740
he is the groom he looks nice too he is
wearing a suit and he has a flower in

405
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,760
his lapel

406
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,90
the minister says words to the couple
which will make them man and wife

407
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,860
the bride and groom smile at each other
but they seem to be a little bit nervous

408
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,680
they give each other gold rings - where
to symbolize that they are married they

409
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,670
kiss each other and walk out of the
church as the organist plays joyous

410
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,570
music

411
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,439
some of the people in the church cried
at the wedding but not because they were

412
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,340
sad

413
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,470
everyone in the church is very happy for
the couple a photographer takes pictures

414
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,760
of the happy couple

415
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,570
we wish them well and look forward to
the reception where we will have dinner

416
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,50
and we will dance and have a good time
until it is very late

417
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,150
the bride will throw her bouquet of
flowers and it is said whoever catches

418
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,760
the bouquet will be the next bride

419
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,790
the next day the bride and groom will
leave for their honeymoon

420
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,540
my cousin and her husband are going to
Mexico for their honeymoon

421
00:33:35,10 --> 00:33:37,870
my dad

422
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,870
my dad is the man whom I respect the
most in my life

423
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,919
he works very hard to make the money
that supports us

424
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,130
my mother has a job too and she also
works very hard

425
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,100
my dad is the principal of a high school
he works at the school all day and often

426
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,230
has to go to meetings at night

427
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,910
he deals with parents students and staff
there was always something that he has

428
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,990
to deal with

429
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:07,690
he has a lot on his mind it doesn't
matter how much work my dad has to do he

430
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,610
always has time for my brother's my
sister and me if I go to him with a

431
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,360
problem

432
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,720
you will sit down and discuss it with me
he doesn't yell

433
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,859
he is always very logical and he tries
to think of the best way to deal with

434
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,700
things

435
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,830
my dad is a very patient man once I
spilled some ink on papers that he was

436
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,819
working on

437
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,850
I thought he would be mad but he didn't
get angry he said it was ok he takes

438
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,529
time out to do things with us

439
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,120
he has taken my brother's fishing he
takes me to the arena to skate and he

feel like we are very special to him he

442
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,870

day I always buy him a car that tells

443
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,759
them just how much he means to me

444
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,60
I think it is important to have good
parents

445
00:34:58,60 --> 00:35:02,170
I hope that when I have children I will
be a good parent like my parents are to

446
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,40
me

447
00:35:03,40 --> 00:35:06,460
parents give children the foundation
they need to live good lives

448
00:35:19,30 --> 00:35:21,530
my mother

449
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,970
my mother does so many things she has a
job at a dress store

450
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,250
she cooks our meals she cleans the house
she feeds the pets and she still finds

451
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,780
time to spend with us

452
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,610
my mother is always busy but she says
that her favorite time is time that she

453
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,780
spends with us

454
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,460
my mother works from monday to friday

455
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,80
something for supper

456
00:35:45,80 --> 00:35:49,910

won't have to do them after supper she

457
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,60
helps us with our homework or she sits
down to watch television

some nights she go shopping and she
takes whoever wants to go with her

she says that cleaning the house is
released favorite thing she says that

464
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,859
the house gets dirty again right after
you clean it

she gets my father my brothers sister
and me to help her with the cleaning my

466
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,759

sometimes she irons them if they need it

467
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,970
my mother says that there are not enough
hours in a day

468
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,560
we try to help my mother as much as we
can there's a lot of work involved in

469
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,900
keeping a home neat and organized

470
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,730
most of my friends mother's work mothers
are the people who you go to when you

471
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,300
need to be comforted mothers are the
people who could make you feel better

472
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,910
i'm glad that i have the mother that I
have my mother is caring and funny

473
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,910
she has fun to be around

474
00:37:06,99 --> 00:37:08,880
a surprise

475
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,259
last Friday my dad came home from work
and said that he had a surprise for us

476
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,879
we tried to guess what the surprise
might be my brother gets that we were

477
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,230
going out for dinner

478
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,180
my dad said no my other brother asked if
my father had tickets to a hockey game

479
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,980
my dad said no my sister asked if we're
going on a trip

480
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:34,619
my dad said no my mother knew what the
surprise was so she just stood and

481
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,609
smiled at us

482
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:41,220
I guess that we might be getting a
swimming pool my dad said no we were

483
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,660
getting very frustrated trying to guess
what the surprise might be my brother

484
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,339
asked how big the surprise was my dad
said that the surprise was quite small

485
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,379
we were not sure what the surprise could
be well we all like it

486
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,119
I ask yes my dad replied every one of
you will love this surprise

487
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:06,150
we heard a noise it was a crying noise
your surprise wants to see you my dad

488
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,160
said he opened the door to the bedroom
and a tiny puppy came running out

489
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,819
we were all very excited our surprise
was a puppy

490
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:18,390
it was a little baby spaniel the puppy
loved all of us

491
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,308
she ran around and let all of our faces
we had always wanted a dog

492
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,940
we take turns feeding the puppy and
taking her out for walks

493
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,420
she is growing quickly and will soon be
an adult dog

494
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,230
we all agree that the puppy was the
nicest surprise my dad could have given

495
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,230
us

496
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,460
rhyming words

497
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,140
sometimes my friends and I play a game
it's something we made up so it doesn't

498
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,220
have a name

499
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,299
we like to take words that rhyme we put
them together line by line

500
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,600
do you get the picture now we're playing
the game and this is how i might say I

501
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,279
like to drive a car

502
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,480
I really don't like to go very far if i
decide to take a walk

503
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,549
I'd go with a friend so that we could
talk do you see that these lines rhyme

504
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,900
play the game

505
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,670
if you have the time we could talk about
school or even playing

506
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,50
do you know what i am saying rhyming
words is easy to do

507
00:39:25,50 --> 00:39:30,960
it's fun for me it can be fun for you
just join in and say something or make

508
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,60
it into a song that you can sing

509
00:39:33,60 --> 00:39:38,460
there are so many words that rhyme with
others like smile and mile and mothers

510
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,600
and brothers

511
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,770
I could spend all day just making up
these things i could let my imagination

512
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:49,950
fly on wings up to the clouds and back
to my mind there are so many rhymes that

513
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:55,439
i can find there are some words that are
hard to find rhymes for I don't use

514
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,970
those words anymore

515
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:03,810
I like to choose words that are easy to
rhyme like cat and bat or lime and time

516
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:09,330
so give it a try I know you'll have fun
I'll say goodbye my rhyming is done

517
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,589
homework

518
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,420
sometimes my teacher gives us homework I
don't mind doing my homework

519
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,859
except when the weather is really nice
and all my friends are outside those

520
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,210
nights I'd rather be outside with them
so I try to get my homework done quickly

521
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,329
tonight i have some english homework

522
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:40,259
we have been reading a book we have to
read a chapter of the book and answer

523
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,390
the questions at the end of the chapter

524
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,960
it is an interesting book so the
homework for this is quite easy

525
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:49,710
my math homework is not so easy

526
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,210
I have to do some addition and
subtraction I don't mind that but there

527
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,289
are some problems that need to be solved
the problems involve addition

528
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,289
subtraction and multiplication

529
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,660
I am not too good with numbers I need to
work harder on my math I just finished a

530
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,460
project for history

531
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,269
I had to make a map of canada with
diagrams showing the roots of all the

532
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:16,439
Explorers it was an interesting project
because i have been to some of the

533
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,599
places that the Explorers went to I
don't have any science homework at

534
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,309
school we are growing bean plants we go
in every day and see how the plants have

535
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,420
grown we write down all the changes that
occur in the plant every day

536
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,930
the only other homework that i have is
geography

537
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,819
I have a map of canada and i have to
write the names of all the provinces and

538
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:40,380
their capitals on it

539
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,89
it won't take me long to do that because
i know all the provinces with my

540
00:41:45,89 --> 00:41:49,410
homework is all done i will go inside
and play ball with my friends until it's

541
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,549
time to come in

542
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:55,229
I am a good student I get good marks
because I like school my favorite

543
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,598
subjects are physical education

544
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,700
english and history math is my least
favorite subject but I'm trying to

545
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,19
improve my marks in that
