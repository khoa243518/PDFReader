1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,478
 Hector is dating Annie

4
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,479
 and Bridget wants to go out with Miguel...

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
 and all Nick wants is a job.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,439
 Nearly ready. There we are!

8
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,439
 Perfect!

9
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 Now the living room.

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,478
 Oh, there!

11
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,479
 Just there!

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 Yeah, perfect, baby!

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,480
 Now, refreshments.

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,839
 Cola, yes!

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
 Crisps, yes!

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,879
 And finally...

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Dial- A- Pizza. Yes!

18
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,959
 Only two hours to go!

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,919
 Nick!

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 What is your television doing in my bathroom?

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,119
 Hi, Bridget.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
 -  So I don't miss anything.
 -  Miss anything?

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
 Yeah, if I have to,
 you know, when the match is on.

24
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,158
 Oh, the match.

25
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,519
 So, who's playing today?

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,520
 It's the semi- finals. England...

27
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,998
 Versus...

28
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,999
 Argentina!

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 Hey, Hector, great outfit, but wrong team.

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,360
 And I've got my lucky World Cup pants on.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,359
 Your lucky World Cup pants?

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
 Yep. I don't change them
 when the World Cup is on.

33
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
 -  But it lasts for weeks.
 -  Yeah.

34
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,679
 So, Hector, I've got the refreshments ready.

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,159
 Cola, crisps...

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 TV in the bathroom.

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 -  At what time is kickoff?
 -  Midday.

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 We had better sit down, then.

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 Hello, everyone.
 Charley and I are ready for the match.

40
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 Annie, you look nice!

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,238
 -  Your ribbons are different.
 -  That's right.

42
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,239
 One for England and one for Argentina.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
 How sweet!

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,159
 But of course England will win.

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,160
 I don't think so, Nick.

46
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,999
 We beat Jamaica 4- 2.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
 But we beat Italy 3- 0.

48
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,759
 Well, our strikers are the best in the world.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 But your defence is poor.

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,518
 -  No, it's not.
 -  Yes, it is.

51
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,719
 It's not! It's not! It's not!

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,759
 It is! It is! It is!

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,798
 Break!

54
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,799
 And now make friends.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
 You're so childish.

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 Miguel arrives today.
 At least he's a real man.

57
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,879
 But he loves football too.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,599
 A Spanish supporter.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 -  Hello?
 -  We'll beat them, in the final.

60
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,158
 Nick, for you. Your agent.

61
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,879
 Goody!

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 Hi, Cameron. How are you?

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 Good. An audition?

64
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,639
 For me?

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,679
 What for?

66
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,438
 London On Fire?

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,439
 The soap? Yes!

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,159
 When?

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,598
 Today? At midday?

70
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,599
 Where?

71
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,318
 Birmingham?

72
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,319
 But that's 100 miles away.

73
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,559
 No, of course I'm pleased.

74
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,878
 OK, thank you.

75
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,879
 Bye.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 An audition for London On Fire? That's brilliant.

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
 Yeah, you must be pleased, man.

78
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,678
 Yes, I am.

79
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,679
 I am very, very pleased.

80
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,959
 I am so happy.

81
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,599
 I can see that.

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,359
 Why today?

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,399
 Why this afternoon?

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,319
 Why in Birmingham?

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,318
 What about the football?

86
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,319
 It's only a football game.

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,839
 Bridget,

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 there are some people who think
 that football is a matter of life and death.

89
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,198
 It isn't.

90
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,199
 It is much more important than that.

91
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,879
 -  Don't go to the audition, then.
 -  Don't go?

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 Don't go? I must go.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 Drama is my life.

94
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,319
 Look, Nick, we can record it for you.

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
 Yeah, and we won't tell you the score.

96
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,199
 Really? You won't tell me the score?
 You promise?

97
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,519
 -  Promise.
 -  Promise.

98
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,318
 OK, promise.

99
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,358
 OK.

100
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,399
 I will go,

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 and perform for England.

102
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,439
 But of course England will win.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
 Yes!

104
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
 I am so happy.

105
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,558
 I don't believe it.

106
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:28,559
 It's a very, very bad hair day.

107
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,559
 And Miguel is arriving this evening.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
 It's a disaster.

109
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,639
 It's a catastrophe.

110
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,798
 I said it's a catastrophe.

111
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,839
 What is a catastrophe?

112
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,919
 Bridget's hair.

113
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,998
 I've got to do something.

114
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,479
 I know. Carol.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 She'll help me.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 ..we've got all the action coming up.

117
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,918
 Hello? Carol?

118
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,959
 Bridget here.

119
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,358
 Look, this is an emergency.

120
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,759
 I need a hair appointment.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 I need a style
 that a Spanish football fan will adore.

122
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,479
 You can? Goody.

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
 I'll see you at five o'clock.

124
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,718
 Sorted!

125
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,718
 ..this semifinal between the two giants...

126
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,759
 Come on, England!

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 Come on, Argentina!

128
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,039
 ..but a strong team.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 England look like... Are they going to score?
 Yes! It looks like it!

130
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,959
 Now Argentina, coming up on the outside.
 They're looking dangerous.

131
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 They've got through the defence
 and they score.

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 Come on, England. They've got to pull
 themselves together. And who's this?

133
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 Look at him. He's broken through.
 And it's a goal!

134
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 A minute to go in this exciting match
 and England have possession.

135
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,599
 Yes! Yes! Yes! It's gone in!

136
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,679
 What a game!

137
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
 Yeah, it was fantastic.

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,479
 Poor Hector.

139
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 -  Argentina did very well against England.
 -  Yeah.

140
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,839
 But not well enough.

141
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,078
 We must not look too happy.

142
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,798
 We promised Nick not to tell him the score.

143
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,799
 And, Hector,

144
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 you must not look too sad.

145
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
 Come on, try to smile.
 Come on, snuggly puppykins.

146
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 Like this.

147
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 It'll do.

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,638
 Hi, Nick.

149
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,639
 -  Hello.
 -  Hi, Nick.

150
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,239
 -  Good match?
 -  You know, so- so.

151
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,559
 Yeah.

152
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,879
 -  Where's the tape?
 -  Hector's got it.

153
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,279
 -  Where's Hector?
 -  In your apartment.

154
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,879
 -  Bye, then.
 -  Bye.

155
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,359
 Yes!

156
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,399
 Hi, Hector.

157
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 Nick, my friend, you are back.

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,319
 Is this is the football match?

159
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Yep.

160
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 -  What?
 -  You won, didn't you?

161
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 -  Won what?
 -  The football.

162
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,519
 Argentina beat England, didn't they?

163
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Nick, I promised you I wouldn't say anything.

164
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,519
 But I know. You're so happy.

165
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 No, I'm not.

166
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 I knew it. I knew it.

167
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,599
 Poor England, my country.

168
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,639
 Nick, you can watch the match on video.

169
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,239
 I can't bear it.

170
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,278
 How, Hector, how could you?

171
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,279
 How could Argentina beat England?

172
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,999
 Nick,

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 just watch the tape.

174
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 I can't wait to see Miguel.

175
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 I'm going to the hairdresser's to get my hair
 done for gorgeous Miguel. Bye.

176
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,160
 Hello.

177
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,519
 OK, repeat after me.

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

179
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

180
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,399
 Bridget, I love your hair.

181
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,439
 Bridget, I love your hair.

182
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 And your smile.

183
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,559
 And your smile.

184
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,559
 No problem, Miguel. See you later.

185
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,398
 Hector and Bridget!

186
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,399
 How could they?

187
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,198
 Argentina did very well against England.

188
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,239
 Yeah.

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 But not well enough.

190
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,919
 This is an emergency.
 I need a hair appointment.

191
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,319
 I need a style
 that a Spanish football fan will adore.

192
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,399
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

193
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,319
 Annie.

194
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,239
 -  Annie?
 -  Yes, Hector?

195
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
 -  Are you all right?
 -  Yes.

196
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 Are you cross about something?

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,640
 Why do you think that?

198
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 Annie, come and sit down.

199
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,918
 Yes!

200
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,919
 Annie, have I done something wrong?

201
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
 Yes!

202
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,238
 Goal!

203
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,239
 Well, if you don't tell me, I won't know.

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You know, Hector. You know.

205
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
 Yes! Yes! Yes! We won!

206
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,559
 We won!

207
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 We're in the final!

208
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 Sorry, have I missed something?

209
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,639
 Bridget?

210
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 Bridget, what's wrong?

211
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,359
 Why have you got a bag on your head?

212
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,199
 -  Come on, let's take it off.
 -  Leave it!

213
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,879
 Is it your hair?

214
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,358
 It can't be that bad.

215
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,799
 It is!

216
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 Come on.

217
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,398
 Do you promise not to laugh?

218
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,399
 We promise.

219
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,759
 Don't we?

220
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 All right, then, here goes.

221
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,839
 It's very...

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,518
 nice.

223
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,518
 I knew it!

224
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,918
 I knew you'd laugh!

225
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,919
 It's a disaster
 and Miguel will be here any moment.

226
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,399
 That's him!

227
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 He mustn't see me like this.

228
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,719
 Miguel?

229
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,079
 Come in.

230
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 I'll just tell Bridget.

231
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,479
 Bridget. Miguel's here.

232
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,759
 I don't want to see him. I can't.

233
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 Trust me, Bridget, he will love your hair.

234
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,799
 Miguel!

235
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

236
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,519
 I love your hair, and your smile.

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 I love your hair.

238
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,279
 So, Spain versus England
 in the World Cup final.

239
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,879
 Poor old England.

240
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 On the contrary, my Spanish friend.

241
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,279
 Prepare to die.

242
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
 Nick, please ask Hector to pass the crisps.

243
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:55,879
 Hector, Annie says can you pass the crisps?

244
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,719
 Please ask Annie
 why hasn't she spoken to me for two days.

245
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,199
 Annie, Hector says
 why haven't you spoken to him for two days?

246
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,238
 Tell him...

247
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,239
 She says...

248
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,599
 It's starting.

249
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 ..final between England
 and their arch- rivals Spain.

250
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,798
 Come on, England. Come on.

251
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,799
 Come on, Spain.

252
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,399
 He passes to Scholes, and yes...

253
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 -  Go on!
 -  And here's Spain...and it's a goal!

254
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,839
 -  Yes!
 -  Goal!

255
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,239
 England have the ball.
 They are heading for goal.

256
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 Yes!

257
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Annie, can I ask you something?

258
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,359
 Yes, Hector?

259
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,479
 Have you ever thought about getting married?

260
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,239
 Who to?

261
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,518
 To someone...

262
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,438
 Someone like...me.

263
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,439
 ..and he shoots and he scores!

264
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,399
 I don't believe it!

265
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,478
 What a match!

266
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,718
 Spain played really well.

267
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,719
 Yeah, but not well enough.

268
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,319
 Poor Miguel. Speak to me in English again.

269
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 Bridget, you are so beautiful.

270
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
 I love your hair and your smile.

271
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,719
 -  Is that all he knows?
 -  Yep, and I taught him.

272
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 -  When?
 -  On the phone.

273
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:10,479
 You were on the phone to Miguel!

274
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,558
 -  Teaching him English.
 -  Silly me!

275
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,559
 I thought you were talking to Bridget.

276
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Annie, there is only one person for me.

277
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,199
 Me?

278
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,959
 Well? Will you?

279
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,079
 Will she what?

280
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 Marry me?

281
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,959
 Yes, Hector!

282
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,478
 Next time in Extra...

283
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:58,238
 Hector and Annie plan their wedding.

284
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,678
 Nick is in for a surprise.

285
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,679
 And guess who's coming from Argentina.

286
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:03,838
 And guess who's coming from Argentina.
