1
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,319
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,399
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Annie cares about animals.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,119
 Hector cares about Annie.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,999
 Bridget mostly cares about herself.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,880
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,559
 Bridget Evans?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,438
 Annie Taylor?

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
 So we went to the restaurant
 and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 and I had the peppers
 and Hector had the mushrooms,

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 which was very nice
 because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,999
 so I said to him that it was good for him to try.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,118
 Annie!

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,119
 And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,319
 and it was such a beautiful evening

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,039
 and the birds were singing...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Annie! Will you shut up?

21
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,878
 Sorry.

22
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,879
 You have been talking non- stop
 for 20 minutes.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,759
 I know. It's...

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence
 for the charity Pigs With No Parents.

25
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,719
 Sponsored...silence!

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,279
 So why are you talking?

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk
 a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,118
 Nothing.

30
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,119
 Have you got a spot?
 I'll call an ambulance!

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 No, but I am going to see my beautician later.

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,398
 What for?

33
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,159
 Just for a check- up.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 A check- up? But you go to the dentist
 for a check- up, for your teeth.

35
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,119
 Exactly.
 I'm going to the beautician's to check...

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,999
 Check that you are beautiful?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Of course not.
 I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?

38
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,839
 Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,639
 Nick!

40
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,999
 Nick! What is the matter?

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 You can tell me.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,439
 You have a toothache.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
 Then if you have a toothache,
 you must go to the den...

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 Can't I say the word 'den...'?

45
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 OK, I won't say the D- word.

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 I call him 'plumber'.

47
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,719
 OK, so when did you last see the plumber?

48
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,119
 That's not too bad, five months ago.

49
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,559
 Five years ago?

50
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:27,679
 When you were five years old?

51
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,119
 It is going to be a big job!

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 He'll need a big drill.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,039
 Come on.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 The girls must know a good plumber.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,359
 Come on.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 Do you want a sweetie?

57
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,679
 Do you want a sweetie?

58
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,879
 Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,199
 Hi, sugar plum.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,118
 Hello, snuggly puppykins.

61
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,158
 Nice clothes. New?

62
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,039
 Yeah. Thanks.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 No, he has a toothache
 so he must see the plumber.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 No, no, no, Hector.
 For a toothache, he must see the dentist.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
 I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.

67
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,479
 'Dentist'.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
 So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.

69
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,278
 So do you know a good plumber?

70
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,478
 A plumber? What for?

71
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
 Nick has toothache.

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
 Well, he doesn't need a plumber.
 He needs a dentist.

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 Yes, Hector, we have
 the number of a very good plumber -  Julian.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,238
 Julian!

75
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,199
 He's so gentle.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,638
 He's so married!

77
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,519
 Hi, Julian.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Listen, we have an emergency here.

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,519
 What are the symptoms?

80
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,199
 Shaking, squealing...

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, just a toothache.

82
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,079
 You can?

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Thank you. Bye.

84
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,798
 Sorted. He'll see Nick now.

85
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,798
 OK, come on, Nick.

86
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,519
 Come on. Come on, Nick.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 Come on...

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 Come on, Nick.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,279
 Julian looked in my mouth once.

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'

91
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,839
 With a mouth that big,
 I'm surprised he didn't fall in.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,078
 Hello.

93
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,119
 Who's this?

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,358
 Bernard?

95
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,278
 Hello, Bernard.

96
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,999
 Hello, Bernard.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,038
 You've been what?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,078
 Robbed?

99
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,799
 When?

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 When you were in the bath?

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,398
 All your clothes?

102
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,719
 And your keys?

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,038
 Poor Bernard.

104
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
 Listen, you must call the police, OK?

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 OK. Bye.

106
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,799
 Poor Bernard.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 It's ten o'clock!
 My sponsored silence starts now.

108
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
 He'll need a big drill.

109
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,159
 If I talk a lot now,
 then I won't have to talk later.

110
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,039
 Have you got a spot?

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 I'll call an ambulance!

112
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,678
 All your clothes?

113
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,679
 And your keys?

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,319
 Bridget Evans?

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,559
 Annie Taylor?

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
 Could I have a word with you, please?

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
 Why not?

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,719
 You can't speak? I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,759
 You can speak.

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 One word. Three syllables.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 First syllable...

124
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,598
 Sit.

125
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,559
 Seat?

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 Chair?

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,278
 Second syllable.

128
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,719
 A? E?

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 I? I.

130
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,959
 T.

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,839
 Chair- I- T.

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
 Chair- I- T?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're being silent for charity!

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But which charity?

135
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,078
 Cow? Dog? Cat?

136
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,119
 Pig?

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

138
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
 Is this man bothering you, Annie?

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 Because if he is,
 I am going to show him some Argentinian...

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

141
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,838
 ..respect.

142
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,839
 -  And you are?
 -  Hector Romero.

143
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
 I suspect you're not English?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 He is a very good detective.

145
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,718
 And you are?

146
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,678
 Nwiff?

147
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,959
 He's just been to see the plumber.

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
 -  The plumber?
 -  Yes, he had a toothache.

149
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,159
 But you don't go to the plumber
 when you've got a toothache.

150
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,798
 -  You go to the den...
 -  Biscuit?

151
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,799
 Dentist.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery

153
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,078
 of Bernard Reynolds'...

154
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,079
 Somebody has stolen Bernard!

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 There's been a robbery
 of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

156
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
 Who would want Bernard's clothes?

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 So I'm investigating everybody in the building

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 because someone
 has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

159
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 Where were you last night?

160
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,079
 I was with Annie.

161
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 -  Annie...
 -  It's OK.

162
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:50,119
 She can't speak for chair- I- T.

163
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
 Anyway, what about Nwiff?

164
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,799
 I...

165
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Show me, Nick.

166
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
 I went to Leo's Bar.

167
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,639
 I had a beer.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 There was a beautiful girl.

169
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,639
 And a motorbike?

170
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 You were with a young woman on a motorbike?

171
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,879
 Motorbike. Registration?

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 Name of young woman?

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 He wasn't with her.

174
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,079
 The young woman
 was on television on a motorbike!

175
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
 I saw that! Very nice!

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Gee, I'm getting good at this.

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,598
 Bridget Evans?

178
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,599
 Annie Taylor?

179
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 Detective David Hunt
 of the Metropolitan Police.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Could I have a word with you, please?

181
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
 Chair- I- T?

182
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,599
 Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

183
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,919
 What about Nwiff?

184
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,598
 Motorbike. Registration?

185
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,599
 Name of young woman?

186
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,878
 There you are!

187
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,679
 Hello, Mr Reynolds.

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,638
 Well, have you caught them?

189
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,679
 -  Who?
 -  The robbers.

190
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,799
 The robbers who stole my clothes.

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 Yes. My investigations are going very well.

192
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,999
 You have a cold, Bernard?

193
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,359
 You need some clothes?

194
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,519
 What a week! First, Mum went away
 to play bingo all weekend.

195
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,679
 Bingo?

196
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,959
 Two fat ladies, 88.

197
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 Clickety- click, 66.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.

199
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,398
 Bingo!

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,399
 Digestives! My favourite.

201
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,678
 You must be Miss Evans.

202
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,679
 And this is Sherlock Holmes!

203
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,519
 Bridget.

204
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 I'd like to ask you a few questions.

205
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!

206
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 What are you staring at?

207
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,759
 Nothing.

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 Is there something wrong with your top lip?

209
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,799
 No.

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Yes, there is. It's bright red.

211
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 It doesn't show, does it?

212
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,878
 No, no, no.

213
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,879
 They told me in the salon no one would notice.

214
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Thank you.

215
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,159
 I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have
 enough money, so a student did them.

216
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,559
 What, a butcher student?

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,358
 There, there. You're still very pretty.

218
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,758
 Am I? Really?

219
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,759
 Really.

220
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,199
 Where were you last night?

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,199
 -  Looking in the mirror.
 -  All night?

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,239
 Yes, all night.

223
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 How can anyone spend all night
 looking at themselves in the mirror?

224
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,039
 Bridget would.

225
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,319
 I think that someone here

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 is not telling the truth

227
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and I think that someone is you.

228
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 But I told you. I was with Annie.

229
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,159
 Annie hasn't said she was with you.

230
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,319
 That's true.

231
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,238
 She can't speak.

232
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
 She is doing
 a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.

233
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?

234
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,119
 -  Yes.
 -  Where?

235
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,438
 -  Shopping.
 -  Shopping?

236
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,478
 For what?

237
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,278
 Some new clothes.

238
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,279
 These new clothes?

239
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,278
 Now, let me get this straight.

240
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,279
 You need some new clothes
 and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.

241
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 So what does that tell me?

242
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,079
 Yes, but I...

243
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Why buy new clothes
 when you can steal somebody else's?

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 Yeah!

245
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,239
 Do these look like Bernard's clothes?

246
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 They could be. My colour.

247
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,999
 Oh, no! I spoke!

248
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,599
 You! You made me speak!

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.

250
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 Bernard, it's your mother.

251
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,198
 Hello, Mum. You're back.

252
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:57,199
 How was bingo?

253
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,679
 Mum, someone stole my clothes.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,118
 OK.

255
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,999
 Right, I'm off.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,799
 Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.

257
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,878
 Bernard, what about your clothes?

258
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,719
 It's OK. She's got them.

259
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,999
 -  What?
 -  What? What?

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 She put them in the washing machine
 before she went to bingo.

261
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
 Mum!

262
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,279
 So Bernard's clothes

263
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 were in the washing machine all the time.

264
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
 Well, yes, as I suspected.

265
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.

266
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,439
 No, you won't!

267
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,638
 What?

268
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:01,639
 You owe me £120 for Pigs With No Parents.

269
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,559
 You made me speak!

270
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Well, will dollars do?

271
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,518
 Next time in Extra...

272
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,519
 The girls enter a game show.

273
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.

274
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:25,879
 And guess what Hector finds on his Jumper.
