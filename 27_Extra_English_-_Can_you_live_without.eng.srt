1
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,319
 Hector and Annie love each other.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
 Nick loves babes and motorbikes

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 and Bridget loves make- up,
 mirrors and chocolate.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,759
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

9
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,239
 It's Marty!

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
 But what Sharon doesn't realise
 is we've got a camera in the bathroom.

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,518
 That's disgusting.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,519
 She must know that we can see her.

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
 I think it is quite clever.

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
 And what are Paul and Mandy doing
 in the living room?

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
 They're kissing. They're kissing.

16
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,558
 They're not kissing. They're whispering.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
 What? Do you call this whispering?

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
 Let's think of another name for it.

19
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
 Paul and Mandy said they could live
 without kissing for 24 hours.

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,159
 And look, they've failed.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Paul and Mandy lose points for that.
 We caught them kissing.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,999
 See you after the break.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Can You Live Without...?
 is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.

24
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,279
 Well, I couldn't live
 without kissing Hector for 24 hours.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,758
 Why don't you try?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,759
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 -  I'm not chewing.
 -  Yes, you are. You're always chewing.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 No...

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,079
 I bet you couldn't stop
 chewing gum for 24 hours.

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,678
 Well, yes, I could.

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,679
 And, anyway, you suck your thumb.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 I do not.
 Well, only when I'm stressed.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,079
 -  I've had an idea!
 -  Oh, no!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 We could be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,599
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
 It would be easy.
 Think of the prize money.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,319
 And Marty Ross presents it.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,879
 He would come to my apartment again.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Oh, Marty.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 He's got such good taste.

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
 And this is fantastic. Original.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,078
 What happened to Marty?

43
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
 He said he needed time away from me
 to really appreciate me.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 -  So he dumped you, then.
 -  He did not!

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,479
 Anyway, Bridget,
 are you feeling persuasive?

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,039
 Of course.
 I'm always feeling persuasive.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,759
 Well, it's time to persuade Marty

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,118
 And then Marty can make it happen.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 I'll try.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,839
 Mr Ross to Studio B, please.

52
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
 -  Hello, Marty.
 -  Hello...

53
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,839
 -  Bridget!
 -  Bridget?

54
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,279
 Bridget, Eunice's researcher.
 We had dinner last month.

55
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
 That Bridget. What do you want?

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,238
 I've got something to say.

57
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,239
 Well, I'm not the father.

58
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,039
 -  No! Nothing like that.
 -  Well, what is it, then?

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
 My friends and I want to be contestants
 on Can You Live Without...?

60
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
 I wish I could help you, but it's not
 my decision, it's the producer's.

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,599
 Now, I must go.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 -  You can't help me? That's a shame.
 -  Yes, it is.

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

64
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,039
 Or this.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,159
 Where did you get them?

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 Don't you remember?
 I'm Eunice's researcher.

67
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,318
 I research.

68
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,319
 I wish I could help you,
 but it's not my decision,

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 it's the newspapers'.

70
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
 All right, all right.
 I'll see what I can do.

71
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,558
 It's time to persuade Marty

72
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,559
 that we want to go on
 Can You Live Without...?

73
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,559
 Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.

74
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,119
 Because I'd hate for the newspapers
 to see this.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Or this.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 We could do it. It's just 24 hours
 of giving up our favourite things.

77
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,079
 It's time for Can You Live Without...?

78
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
 And here's someone
 you just can't live without.

79
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,279
 It's Marty!

80
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,479
 Hello, darlings.

81
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 Do you want to spend
 the next 24 hours with me?

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,518
 -  Yeah!
 -  Correct answer!

83
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,519
 Yes, let's see what the people
 who live here...can live without.

84
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,279
 But it looks like
 they live without anything anyway.

85
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
 Well, let's meet the contestants.

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
 You first, pretty lady. What's your name?

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 You already know my name, Marty.

88
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
 We have a pretty joker here.

89
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,559
 Don't get smart, sweetie.

90
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 This is my show, photo or no photo.

91
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,479
 -  Bridget.
 -  Good luck, Bridget.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 -  And who do we have here?
 -  Hello.

93
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,079
 My name is Annie
 and I'm Hector's girlfriend...

94
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,159
 and I love Charley, my dog.

95
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,519
 So, which one could you live without?

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
 Enough said!

97
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 And this is Hector.

98
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
 So, Hector,
 Annie loves her dog more than you.

99
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,559
 Mind you, Hector does sound
 like a dog's name, doesn't it?

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 Here, Hector! Here, boy!

101
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,438
 Don't bite!

102
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,439
 And, last of all and least of all...

103
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,959
 it's...

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Hello? Is anybody there?

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 I know, you're a fish.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 Hi. I'm Nick.

107
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,159
 Hi, Nick. And what do you like?

108
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,839
 Bananas!

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,439
 Baboons. You like baboons!

110
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
 You are a baboon.
 You're a small baboon.

111
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,358
 No, it's not baboons.

112
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,118
 You like babes!

113
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,119
 Sorry, this is Nick and he likes babes.

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,958
 Well, let's get on with it.

115
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 As usual, each of these contestants
 has picked one thing

116
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 that their flatmates
 cannot live without for 24 hours.

117
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,238
 Bridget...

118
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
 You must live without chocolate...
 mirrors...and make- up.

119
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 Annie, you must live without...

120
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 touching Hector, sucking your thumb...

121
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 and, most of all,
 you must live without Charley.

122
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
 Hector, you must live without...

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
 touching Annie and chewing gum.

124
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,318
 Nick, you must live without...

125
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
 talking about babes
 or talking about motorbikes.

126
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
 And all of you must live without

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 television, magazines and music.

128
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 24 hours of living without starts now.

129
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
 Come on, Charley.
 You're coming with me.

130
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
 Don't forget -  I'll be watching.

131
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,999
 No television!

132
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,958
 No touching.

133
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
 If you touch, we lose points
 and we won't win a big prize.

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 No make- up. What must I look like?

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 And no mirrors!

136
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
 Look at that guy.
 He looks like a monkey at the zoo.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 So how will they do? Top points
 could mean a holiday in the Caribbean.

138
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,038
 But if they fail, they lose points

139
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
 and their prize holiday could be this.

140
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,159
 Of course, we might give them one or two
 temptations to make interesting television.

141
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,679
 Join me after the break.

142
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 You must live without touching Hector.

143
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 Nick, you must live
 without talking about babes

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 or talking about motorbikes.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 24 hours of living without starts now.

146
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,718
 I think it's going to rain.

147
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,719
 -  Do you?
 -  I agree.

148
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,798
 Manchester United are doing well.

149
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
 -  Are they?
 -  I agree.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 I think it's going to rain.

151
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
 Weather and football - 
 is that all you can talk about?

152
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 Well, yesterday I met this really cute b...

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Don't say it! Do not talk
 about babes or motorbikes.

154
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,079
 Careful!

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Bridget, no mirrors. You lose ten points.

156
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,439
 But it's not a mirror, it's a kettle.

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
 Don't argue!
 You lose another ten points.

158
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 Well, it's all quiet now.

159
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 What about some temptation?

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
 Hector, what is in your mouth?

161
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,878
 Nothing.

162
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
 -  Are you chewing gum, Hector?
 -  No.

163
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
 No, he's not. He's chewing this.

164
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 Open.

165
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
 That was from the Red Sea.
 It cost a lot of money.

166
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,319
 I could kill for some chocolate.

167
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,599
 This should be fun!

168
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,719
 'Bridget.

169
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 'I love the show, love from...

170
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
 'Orlando Bloom.'

171
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 Orlando Bloom...watching me!

172
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
 I hope you didn't hear me say that.

173
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
 What do I look like?
 What do I look like?

174
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,958
 What are you doing, Annie?

175
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm talking to Charley.

176
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,719
 Annie, you must live without Charley.
 You lose ten points.

177
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,199
 What?

178
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,039
 Hector...

179
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 - Don't move!
 -  What is it?

180
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,879
 It's OK, just don't move.

181
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 I'm not going anywhere.

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
 What Hector doesn't know is that
 we've put that spider on his jumper.

183
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,599
 This is wonderful TV

184
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,999
 Think, think!

185
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 One minute.

186
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,599
 That's better.

187
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Now, we'll just
 brush this little fellow off.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 Don't touch it!

189
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
 It's OK.
 I'm sure it's not poisonous.

190
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,038
 How do you know?

191
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,039
 Anyway, if you touch me,
 we will lose points.

192
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 OK.

194
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,919
 Now...stay still.

195
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,159
 Don't move!

196
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 Hang on a minute!

197
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
 Hector, this is a toy.

198
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,999
 I knew that.

199
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,119
 Hector, you were so funny.

200
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 Marty has played a trick on us.

201
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 Yeah, very funny.

202
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,798
 Who's a cross boy?

203
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
 Things are getting really hot now

204
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 and they've still got over 12 hours to go.

205
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,279
 You know, Hector,
 I really think we can do this.

206
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,159
 We can win that holiday.

207
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,758
 Hello, Annie.

208
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,118
 Bridget, what are you doing in there?

209
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,119
 I'm...just reading the electricity meter.

210
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,839
 Come here.

211
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
 Why are you wearing dark glasses?

212
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 I don't want Orlando to see me
 without make- up.

213
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,159
 Bridget! Is that chocolate?

214
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
 No.

215
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
 But they're from Orlando!

216
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 No chocolate, Bridget.
 You lose 100 points.

217
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 Nick has entered the building!

218
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Nick!

219
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 Yes! Annie and Hector touched.
 They lose 200 points.

220
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 -  What?
 -  It was an accident.

221
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,479
 And best of all, Nick,
 you can't live without motorbikes.

222
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 So you lose 500 points.

223
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,199
 No, no, no, no!

224
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
 You said no talking about motorbikes,
 actually, big nose!

225
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,278
 Yeah, Marty.

226
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
 So thanks for the present.
 You can keep your holiday.

227
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,119
 What? You can't do that.

228
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Baby, fancy a ride?

229
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
 Yeah!

230
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,678
 Hector, this is for Marty.

231
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,679
 Or should I say...Martina?

232
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 So, Marty, if you want the bike,
 come and get it.

233
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 Sorry, Marty, we can live without you.

234
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
 Goodbye.

235
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,279
 And, Marty, I think your audience
 will love this picture of you.

236
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,438
 Oh, no!

237
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
 Come on, Annie.
 We have lots of catching up to do.

238
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
 Hector, catch me!

239
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,758
 Next time in Extra...

240
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie play under the mistletoe.

241
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,759
 Nick plays Santa while Hector
 and Annie plays under the mistletoe.
