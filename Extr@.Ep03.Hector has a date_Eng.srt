1
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:44,908
What are you doing, Annie?

2
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,739
Nothing!

3
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:48,028
What's this?

4
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:52,458
'Dream date, make my 
dream come true … '

5
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,442
Oh, how did that get there?

6
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,225
How sweet!

7
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:04,996
Hector!

8
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,022
Hector!

9
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:10,422
Oh hi, Bridget.

10
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,676
And up!!

11
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,432
Oh well, keep going, Hector.

12
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:23,333
Aah I see Hector found Cindy's 
one hundred and one top exercises then.

13
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,508
Yes!

14
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,423
Oh, good try Hector.

15
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:32,818
Cindy is so old fashioned, 
I can teach Hector how to exercise!

16
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:40,172
Exercise with Cindy, no, 
exercise with Bridget, yes …

17
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:40,986
But … !

18
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,942
It's OK, I can do it!

19
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,008
Music please, Annie.

20
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:51,835
OK. Follow me.

21
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,647
Arms up, touch your toes, 
stand straight and 

22
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,620
- one-two-three -four-five-six-seven-eight!

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,083
More energy please!

24
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,921
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight

25
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,691
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight

26
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,521
OK, faster still!

27
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,193
Left leg up!

28
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:15,686
Left leg up!

29
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,580
Left leg up!

30
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,451
Oh, my leg hurts!

31
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,541
Come on, keep it up!

32
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,662
Come on, come on, faster …

33
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,406
Come on, come on, faster …

34
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,119
Oh, hi Nick, 

35
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:43,950
we're exercising.

36
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:44,891
I can see.

37
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,914
Oh, phew, OK.

38
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:49,780
Let's get a drink!

39
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,809
Oh, I must check my emails.

40
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,805
Would you like some water, Hector?

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,381
Oh no, no, after you.

42
00:03:58,733 --> 00:03:59,887
No, you first.

43
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:03,199
Oh, no, no, no, ladies first.
No, no, you first

44
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,214
No, you first.

45
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,010
OH, give it to me!

46
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,358
Oh, goody! Three messages.

47
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,639
Oh dear.
What's wrong?

48
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:14,668
Annie's been on the Internet - again!

49
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,815
The Internet?

50
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,531
To find a boyfriend!

51
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,790
Oh, let's see!
Oh no, don't look.

52
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,207
Oh come on Annie!

53
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,699
Oh, all right then.

54
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:35,603
Ugh!

55
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,680
OK, number two.
Mmm...

56
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,399
A taxidermist!

57
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,082
Oh, how horrible!

58
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:59,144
Oh Charlie, here boy! 

59
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,645
It's OK, Charlie.

60
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:06,577
Annie, what is a taxidermist?

61
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:10,564
Erm, well it's, 

62
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:14,601
it's a, ah, oh never mind.

63
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,229
Third time lucky.

64
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,320
Hope so.
Hmm...

65
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,493
Oh dear!

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,904
Oh, I'll never get a boyfriend!

67
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,923
Bridget always has a boyfriend. 

68
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,412
Has she?

69
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,204
Annie, look, it's not what you write, 
it's, 

70
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,265
it's how you write it. 

71
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:08,805
 I bet I could get a girlfriend 
on the Internet, no problem.

72
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,370
Well yes Nick you could!

73
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,055
I bet you could not!

74
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,550
I could!

75
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:17,997
OK, 

76
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,192
what would you write?

77
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm six foot tall. 

78
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,820
Five foot eleven.

79
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,152
I have blonde hair.

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,970
Mousey brown.

81
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,443
I love animals.
Ha!

82
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,879
And fast cars, 
and beautiful women.

83
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,800
I would write to you!

84
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:43,600
Would you?

85
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,650
Oh, come on Annie!

86
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,423
Let's go to the gym.

87
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh Bridget no, 
not more exercise!

88
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,415
See you later boys.

89
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:59,047
Oh and erm, Hector, 
would you do my washing for me?

90
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,589
Washing? OK.
No problem.

91
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,347
Oh and Nick 
will you spray my plant for me please?

92
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,994
The spray is in the bathroom.

93
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,216
No problem.

94
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,830
Nick. 

95
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:24,692
What is a taxidermist?

96
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,594
Oh -well, 

97
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,147
well it's, 

98
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,070
never mind.

99
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:05,705
Finding  girlfriends 
on the Internet is so easy.

100
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,985
OK, Hector!
Question one. 

101
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:12,020
How do guys get girlfriends?

102
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:14,246
Girlfriends?
Yeah! 

103
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:18,246
Girlfriends.
Oh, 

104
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:21,276
oh no girlfriends, me.

105
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:22,483
Never.

106
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,054
What?
Never?

107
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
No girl … no girlfriends?

108
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:28,331
Wow! Man!

109
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:29,332
You, Nick, 

110
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,075
you have had girlfriends?
Yeah, loads!

111
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,009
Ten?

112
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,276
Ten?!! Hah! 
Hundreds!

113
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:43,340
Wow!
So I know what girls like.

114
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,945
They like fast cars, 

115
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,440
they like money, 

116
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:52,570
they like dancing.

117
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,101
Oh, I love dancing!

118
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:04,800
Like this!

119
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,449
No, dancing like this!

120
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,524
Hey?

121
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,696
Yeah, Hector, leave it to me.

122
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,093
Leave it to me, my friend, 
I  have a plan!

123
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:24,974
Oh, Hector, Annie's plant.

124
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,802
Her garden spray is in the bathroom.

125
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:29,842
Oh. 

126
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:36,838
Garden - gar-den …

127
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:02,526
Spray, garden spray.

128
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,442
Garden Romance, garden …  
good!

129
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,726
Hmm!
Perfect!

130
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,017
Perfect!

131
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,493
Cold, hot, very hot. Erm, Nick.

132
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,637
Uh-huh?
Bridget's cold or hot?

133
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:05,872
Hah, very hot!
Ah.

134
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:13,187
Perfect!

135
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:16,773
Perfect, ha!

136
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,522
Hector, 
we'll get lots of girlfriends now!

137
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,576
From now on it'll be 
girls, girls, girls, girls!

138
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,961
Yo!
Hey! 

139
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,360
Whoo!

140
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,053
Oh you really must... 

141
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,350
...change 
your after shave! 

142
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:43,476
Oh, excuse me, come on,
 let's go out and celebrate.

143
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:59,185
What's that smell?

144
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,807
It smells like a perfumery.

145
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:07,206
Oh, my plant!

146
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,131
Oh, empty!

147
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,582
Oh, my poor plant!
I don't believe it!

148
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,169
My perfume, 
I don't believe it!

149
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:23,832
Nick!

150
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,710
Oh good, the washing's done.

151
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,377
What's the problem?

152
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,282
This is the problem!

153
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:47,633
Hector!

154
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,952
Wow!
What is it now?

155
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,988
We have six hundred and thirty three 
messages!

156
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:57,600
Let's see.

157
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,416
OK, one moment.

158
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,237
These messages are all 
for Hector and Nick 

159
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:19,144
- and  they're all from girls!

160
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:22,522
I smell a rat!
Hmm!

161
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:25,471
And I think I know who is responsible!

162
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:27,866
Oh, Bridget!

163
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:28,762
Look at this! 

164
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,200
What?

165
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,003
'See attached photo.'

166
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:54,259
Ha, cheats, 
they glued their photo on this car!

167
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,646
Ha, what a joke!

168
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,346
What!

169
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,450
that's how they received six hundred 
and thirty three messages from girls.

170
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:06,300
But they don't know they received 
six hundred and thirty three messages, 

171
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,460
do they!

172
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,480
No, they don't - now.

173
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,231
Let's go to the cyber café.

174
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,560
I have a plan.

175
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,591
The poor computer.
How many messages?

176
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:36,567
One hundred!
Two hundred!

177
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:38,522
Oh.
How many?

178
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,365
Erm, one.
Good!

179
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:41,538
One hundred!

180
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,885
Erm, no, no, no, 
just one message.

181
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:44,731
Uh?

182
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,500
[Erm] 

183
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,984
Dancers, 
you mean... 

184
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,389
… dancers?! 
Yes, sort of.

185
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:22,246
Wow!!
They sound gorgeous!

186
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:23,099
Uh?

187
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:24,406
Ah, 

188
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,682
ah-hah!

189
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,294
Cuddles and Bubbles 

190
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,862
are coming here tonight 

191
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,846
when they finish the show 

192
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:39,733

193
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:43,444

194
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,837
Look, 
7 o'clock, 8, 9, 10 o'clock!

195
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,600
Wait a minute!

196
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,080
It's 7 o'clock!

197
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,550
That's just three hours!

198
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:56,900
What am I going to wear?

199
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:58,690
What are you going to wear?

200
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,880
But Nick, 
what about Bridget and Annie?

201
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,858
Aha!

202
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,165
It's not a problem!
Ah-ha-ha! Yes!

203
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,360
So, Nick, what should I say?

204
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,030
It's easy, relax.

205
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:37,936
Yeah, but you have had 
a hundred girlfriends.

206
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:43,284
Yeah, well, when I said a hundred,
 it's actually fewer.

207
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,661
… Fifty?

208
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:46,666
No.

00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:48,591

00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:51,347
Thirty?

212
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:52,014
No.

213
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:53,439
Twenty?

214
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:54,115
No.

215
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,242
Ten?

216
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:55,986
No.

217
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,080
Five?

218
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,692

228
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,388
Aaaah!!!

00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:11,316
OK.

230
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,403
It's OK.

231
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:17,450

So Nick, what do I say?

236
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,834
OK, we need a script.

237
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,912
Try this.

238
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,776
Your eyes are b l u e, 

239
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,881
like the ocean.

240
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:48,200
Your ears are blue, 

241
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,959
like the ocean.

242
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,750
No!!
Eyes, ears, ears! Eyes!

243
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,433
Oh, oh, oh, OK, OK.

Your ey-es are blue,

246
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,500
Good!

247
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,715
You smell...

Sweet, not sweat!

251
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh, OK, OK.

252
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:24,600
OK, your hair is so soft.

253
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:26,650
Thank you, Nick.

254
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:30,800
No, No, her hair, her hair!

255
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,730
Oh, her hair!

256
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:34,189

Good luck!

259
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,046
Oh, 

260
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:53,288
Cuddles and Bubbles.

261
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,698
But we thought you were dancers.

262
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,214
Oh, you are dancers.

263
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,551
Dancing … dogs!

265
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,944
Ha, ha, hello, come in.

Sit!

269
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,192
Stick to the script.

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,268
You smell so sweet.

271
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,365
Your ears are … 
blue, like the ocean.

272
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,250
Eyes, eyes!

273
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,591
Eyes!

274
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:58,194
Are you a million-aire?

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,065
Psst, psst!
Am I a millionaire?

276
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,599
Are you a millionaire?

277
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,050
Are you a millionaire?

278
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,490
We are millionaires!

279
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Good - good.

280
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,589
Well you can pay for these then!!

We are the dancers …

284
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:37,441
So you are millionaires, ay?

Or is it ears?

293
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,017
It's the landlady!
I'm off!

294
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:05,585
Quick, hide Hector!

295
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,923
Erm, in the bedroom!

296
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,406
Oh Bridget.

297
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,682
Yes.

298
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,660
Tell me.

299
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,437
What is a taxidermist?

300
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,733
Oh!!!!

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,477
Next time in EXTRA.

302
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,841
Hector wants to get a job.

303
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,070
Bridget and Annie have a surprise.

304
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:45,387
