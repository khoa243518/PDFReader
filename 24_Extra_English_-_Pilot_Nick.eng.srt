 This is the story
 ofBridget andAnnie,

00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,279

00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 and the boys next door -  Nick,
 and his friend Hector from Argentina.

00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,559
 Bridget and Hector

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,879
 Annie works for the environment

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,880
 and Nick works as little as possible.

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,399
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,999
 One for the party
 and one for the party hostess.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 One for the party
 and one for the party...

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 accountant.

11
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,599
 Hey, it's Builder Barbie!

12
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,319
 Very funny.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,478
 Eunice wants some building work done

14
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,119
 and guess who has to organise it.

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 Builder Barbie?

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 Hey, not for you, for the party.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 We're having a party?
 What shall I wear?

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,919
 It's a street party.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 We're having a party in the street
 to protest and stop the cars.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
 Nice!

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,760
 Hey, what's this?

22
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:07,279
 Don't touch it.
 It belonged to my grandmother.

23
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,198
 Your grandmother? It's lovely.

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,199
 Yes. It's very special to me.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 Well, what do you think?

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 Captain Chip Hardy,
 Pilot Extraordinaire.

27
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,199
 Nick, is that you?

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,279
 It can't be.

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
 Women love uniforms.

30
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,839
 Hey, hey,
 Builder Barbie and Pilot Ken!

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 But why are you dressed like a pilot?

32
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,639
 I am in a play - 

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire - 

34
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,279
 for a theatre festival in Paris.

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,840
 Now, who is going
 to help me rehearse?

36
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
 Sorry, got to go.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,880
 Come on, you know you want to.

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
 -  Come fly with me.
 -  What?

39
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,399
 Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
 about you all the time.

40
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,439
 -  Nick, I really think...
 -  Don't tell me, I feel it too - 

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,639
 something's not quite right.

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,158
 I have got it.

43
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,159
 Here. There. Beautiful.
 Now, I can fancy you.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,160
 Oh, no, Nick, please.

45
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:02,158
 Did you miss me, sweet thing?

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,159
 Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
 about you all the time.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
 When we get to Barbados...

48
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,958
 Sorry.

49
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,959
 But now, we have work to do.

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is
 your captain Chip Hardy speaking.

51
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,519
 We will now go through
 the safety routine.

52
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,519
 Exits are here, here and here.

53
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,078
 In the event of cabin decompression,

54
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,079
 place oxygen masks
 over your face, like so.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 But please, attend to your own mask
 before helping children.

56
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,079
 Life jackets can be found
 under your seat.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 In case of forced landing,
 adopt the following position.

58
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,518
 Eunice,

59
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,519
 -  I've got the builders on the phone.
 -  About time.

60
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
 Hello. You can start today?

61
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,519
 Oh, Jean- Pierre,
 how nice to hear from you.

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,158
 We really need the job done quickly.

63
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,159
 We should meet tonight? Oh, yes.

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,439
 Ah, yes, where to start?

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 Where? Mm,
 that's a very good question.

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,320
 Where would you like
 the building work to start?

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 I was thinking...in my flat.

68
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,079
 -  In your flat?
 -  Oh, yes. In my flat.

69
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,199
 Hello? We want you
 to start work in Eunice's flat.

70
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,919
 Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 -  It's 31 Evergreen Street.
 -  It's 31 Evergreen Street.

72
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,599
 That's right. Bye.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 -  Tea? Coffee?
 -  No, no, no!

74
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,599
 Make it musical, feel the words.

75
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,799
 Tea! Or coffee!

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 Tea! Or coffee!

77
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,239
 Thanks.

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 Hey, Nick, do women really
 go for you in that uniform?

79
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,799
 Yeah.

80
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,399
 But do they know
 that you are not a real pilot?

81
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,719
 Well...

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
 You tell them you are a real pilot?

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Maybe.

84
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

85
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,758
 Oh, hi, Tiffany.

86
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,759
 I love this uniform!

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,038
 Yes, that's right, sweetie.

88
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,039
 Currently flying at 20,000 feet,
 heading for Barbados.

89
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,959
 Yes, that's right, darling,
 above the clouds, above the clouds.

90
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,839
 Mayday, mayday...

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,638
 No, no, no, we're just...

92
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,639
 We're not being attacked,
 it's just a bit of turbulence.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 Look, I've got to go. Bye- bye.

94
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,760
 -  Hi, Eunice.
 -  Guess where this came from.

95
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,119
 -  DIY shop?
 -  No. From my flat.

96
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,920
 Ah, yes. Have the builders started?
 Excellent.

97
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 Excellent? Excellent?!
 My flat is a mess.

98
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,199
 You told the builders
 to work in my flat?

99
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,239
 Yes, you said.

100
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 But the builders were supposed
 to work at Channel 9.

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,278
 Your mistake, you fix it.

102
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,279
 -  But you...
 -  And until you do,

103
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 I'm going to stay in your flat.

104
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 We want you to start work
 in Eunice's flat.

105
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

106
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
 Captain Chip Hardy,
 Pilot Extraordinaire.

107
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
 I want to ride the pony!

108
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,998
 Bridget, I want my breakfast now.

109
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
 Of course.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,719
 -  What would you like?
 -  I want...

111
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 fresh coconut milk,
 two rashers of crisp bacon,

112
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
 preserve of morello cherries - 
 on French toast - 

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 and coffee -  Italian coffee.

114
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,038
 Fresh coconut milk, Italian coffee?

115
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 -  I don't have...
 -  So, go out and buy them for me.

116
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,159
 Horrible!

117
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,879
 Captain Hardy,
 what are we going to do?

118
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,119
 It will be OK.

119
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,079
 I am too young to die.

120
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,319
 -  You have to save us.
 -  Try to be calm.

121
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,999
 But what about my family?
 What about my cat?

122
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 Pull yourself together, woman.

123
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 Excellent! You're really good.
 That was like...

124
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,759
 Catherine Zeta- Jones.

125
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,918
 You didn't have to slap me for real.

126
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,919
 Sorry, but I...

127
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,759
 Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

128
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,918
 What?

129
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,919
 It's the director.

130
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 What? What?!

131
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,319
 Just a minute.

132
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,998
 The actress? She's ill?

133
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,439
 But we must still do the play.

134
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 No, we don't have much time.

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 Don't worry, I know the perfect
 person to play the part.

136
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,639
 Oh, yes, the perfect person. Bye.

137
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,759
 I...have an extra ticket for Paris.

138
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,558
 -  Do you want to come with me?
 -  Paris?

139
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,559
 -  Oui, oui.
 -  Excellente!

140
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,679
 You call this a breakfast?

141
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,280
 That's what I think of this.

142
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,399
 And this.

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 And this.

144
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,639
 And I have a little washing for you.

145
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,239
 In the bedroom.

146
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 Now, what shall I eat?

147
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
 You call this, 'a little washing?'

148
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,999
 Be quiet and do it.

149
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
 Hi. I got some polish
 for Granny's chest.

150
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,198
 -  Nice.
 -  Oh, I love it so much.

151
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,199
 It really reminds me of her.

152
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,799
 Hey, you're eating my party food.

153
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,199
 Yes, but...

154
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 it's not very good.
 Here, Charley boy!

155
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 Annie, Annie, please.

156
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 I don't want to lose my job.
 It's only for a few days.

157
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,959
 Now, which of you lucky girls
 is going to cut my toenails?

158
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,879
 I'm going to kill that woman!

159
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,278
 No, no, let me.

160
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,279
 Are you having fun with Eunice?

161
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,319
 Why don't you stay here
 while we are away?

162
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,039
 No, thank you.

163
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
 Good luck in Paris.

164
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 Oh, Paris, c'est magnifique!

165
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 Hector, where were you?
 Our play starts soon.

166
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:15,479
 OK, good luck.

167
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,599
 Hector, there's something
 I've got to tell you.

168
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,519
 Your play, it starts very soon.

169
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,399
 Where is the actress
 who plays the stewardess?

170
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 Well, actually she's right here.

171
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,439
 Good joke.

172
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,238
 The actress, she's ill.

173
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,959
 You are going to play the stewardess.

174
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,838
 Look, there's your costume.

175
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,718
 You are not serious?

176
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,598
 You are serious.

177
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,599
 Listen, Sylvia,
 I am going to fly this plane,

178
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
 I will need all my crew.
 You are a professional.

179
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,759
 I am your captain.

180
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 Will you fly with me?

181
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,239
 No, no. No, no, no.

182
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 I am not doing it.

183
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 Sylvia, I'm proud of you.

184
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,679
 Oh, shut up.

185
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 What's that?

186
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,599
 -  Come and have something to eat.
 -  The shape looks familiar.

187
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
 You've guessed.

188
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,878
 It is that chest.

189
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,879
 I did some work on it for you.

190
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,039
 It looked so boring.
 I gave it a whole new look.

191
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 My grandmother's chest!

192
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,679
 Annie, Annie, please.

193
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 Annie, Annie, please.

194
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:54,199
 Where is the actress
 who plays the stewardess?

195
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
 Well, she's ill.

196
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,438
 You are going to play the stewardess.

197
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:06,439
 Oh, shut up.

198
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,118
 That was close!
 We nearly missed the plane.

199
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,118
 Look at the reviews.

200
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,119
 'Irresistible.'

201
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,879
 'Dazzling.'

202
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 And that was just her legs.

203
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,479
 'The hostess was beautiful...

204
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,199
 in a masculine way.'

205
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,479
 What's going on?

206
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 we're experiencing some turbulence.

207
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 There's nothing to worry about except
 that the pilot and co- pilot are ill.

208
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,679
 Does anybody know how to fly a plane?

209
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,079
 Don't worry, I will fly this plane.

210
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Nick, you cannot fly this plane.

211
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
 I am Captain Chip Hardy.

212
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,359
 I can do anything.

213
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,518
 You are just an actor.

214
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,519
 Captain Chip Hardy is your character.

215
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,279
 But I have the heart of a pilot.

216
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 Tea? Coffee?

217
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,759
 Wait a minute.

218
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
 Hello?

219
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,559
 Oh, really? Oh, excellent!

220
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,158
 Goodbye.

221
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,318
 Who was that?

222
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,319
 The builders.
 Eunice's flat is finished!

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,519
 Really?

224
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 Her flat is ready!

225
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,279
 Our flat is ours again!

226
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
 Hello, girls.
 Have you had a nice time?

227
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,758
 What happened here?

228
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,759
 Just a little party.

229
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,559
 It was really fun.

230
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,678
 OK, Eunice,

231
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,719
 we've spoken to the builders.

232
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,879
 Your flat's ready.

233
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 You can go home now.

234
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,319
 I like it here.

235
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,639
 I think I'm going to stay.

236
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 Where's my cocktail?

237
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,879
 Bring my new wig.

238
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 -  What do you mean?
 -  What do I mean?

239
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,640
 I am going to stay.

240
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,118
 We are back!

241
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,719
 Paris was great and...

242
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 Pilot Ken and Stewardess Barbie.

243
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,959
 But he really is a pilot - 
 he flew the plane!

244
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
 Well, for a moment.
 Till the co- pilot punched me.

245
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
 What happened here? A hurricane?

246
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 Yes, something like that.

247
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 Well, Nick, what's this? A new job?

248
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,919
 Yes, sort of.

249
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 So, Mr Pilot, shall we have some fun?

250
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,598
 Yeah, OK.

251
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,599
 Will you take me flying?

252
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,359
 OK.

253
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,398
 Shall we stay here or go to my place?

254
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,399
 Let's go to your place.
 This place is a mess!

255
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 Really, girls,
 you should tidy up a bit.

256
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 It is the uniform.

257
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,639
 At last, she's gone!

258
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,518
 I'm exhausted.

259
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,519
 Well, if you are tired, can I
 offer you some tea or coffee?

260
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,998
 Next time in Extra - 

261
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,958
 Bridget is interested in modern art,

262
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,959
 Annie is fighting
 to free farm animals,

263
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,638
 and who else is coming to dinner?

264
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:17,638
 andwho else is coming to dinner?
