butterflies all of these things are

6
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,830
mysteries to me

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,949
there are so many questions that are
unanswered

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,19
I think I should go to the library and
get a book to find out why people grow

9
00:00:41,20 --> 00:00:42,70
old

10
00:00:42,70 --> 00:00:47,890

to know where electricity comes from

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,479
I wonder if I'll ever find out the
answers to all of my questions

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,000
I think I'll have to study hard and stay
in school to find out everything that I

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,960
want to know some questions never get
answered it is good to be curious people

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,240
who are curious about things are the
ones who learn a lot and some curious

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,829
people go on to invent things and make
important discoveries

23
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,740
creative people some people are just
born to create that's what I think some

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,780
people just have the need to write
stories composed beautiful music or

25
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,570
paint pictures creativity seems to be
inside them and they need to let it out

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,840
it's good that we have people like that
composers like Mozart and Chopin have

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,900
given us music that is incredibly
beautiful

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,890
it's not just the classical composers
who have given us great pieces of music

29
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,529
there are modern composers who have
written great songs also Elton John is

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,610
an example of someone who has composed
many wonderful songs

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,540
andrew lloyd webber has given us some
very popular musicals like cats and the

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
Phantom of the Opera

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,950
there are so many talented and creative
people in this world when you visit an

34
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,920
art gallery you marvel at how artists
are able to recreate realism or make up

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,220
something that seems totally unreal yet
beautiful

36
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,130
the American artist Norman Rockwell
painted some pictures that actually look

37
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
like photographs

38
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,109
he tried to portray life as it was in
America through his paintings one can

39
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,590
get a good sense of American life
through the years

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,140
on the other hand artists like Jackson
Pollock did not portray realism Jackson

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,190
Pollock painted

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,799
abstract pictures his paintings are just
as good as Norman Rockwell's but they

43
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,410
are entirely different some books that
we read our classics

44
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,799
Mark Twain portrayed american life
through his characters

45
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,780
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn Charles
Dickens brought Victorian England to

46
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,579
life through his books

47
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,989
most people are familiar with his
Christmas Carol where the mean and

48
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,890
miserable Scrooge learns the true
meaning of Christmas

49
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,660
people don't have to read the classics
there are modern writers who entertain

50
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,579
readers through their stories

51
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,580
Stephen King has written a number of
horror stories some of his books

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,40
have even been made into movies we are
lucky to have creative people who share

53
00:04:14,40 --> 00:04:18,779
their gifts with us if you are lucky
enough to be creative

54
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,549

works of art that we can all share

headaches

I told my mother about it and she made
an appointment with the up tom at rest

96
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,210
I went to a place where they made me
read words and letters on a chart some

97
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,479
of the words were big and some were very
small

98
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,340
I tried to read everything but sometimes
I couldn't see some of the small letters

99
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,820
the optometrist would cover one of my
eyes while i read the charts

100
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,909
then she would cover my other eye

101
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,940
she even put some drops in my eyes

102
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,920
I asked the optometrist if I had passed
or failed the test

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,570
she laughed and said it wasn't that kind
of tests that you passed or failed

104
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,280
she was just tried to find out if I
needed classes

105
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,830
I did meet glasses my mother and I
looked around there were many pairs of

106
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,909
frames

107
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,220
I wanted something that was in style I
tried on many pairs of frames

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,510
some of them look good on me and some of
them look really funny on me

109
00:08:16,20 --> 00:08:19,409
I finally chose a frame that was my
favorite

110
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,740
I gave them to a lady who did some
measurements

111
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,80
she told me to come back on Friday to
get my classes on friday i got my

112
00:08:28,80 --> 00:08:34,199
glasses my friends like them they said i
looked smart in my classes I wore them

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,810
to school on monday and i was able to
see the blackboard clearly I didn't

114
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,30
realize how much I hadn't been able to
see now I don't get headaches anymore

115
00:08:45,30 --> 00:08:48,329
i'm glad that i have my glasses

116
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,110
everything is a lot clearer now

117
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,689
I am clumsy my mother says that I am
clumsy

118
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,000
my father says that I am clumsy i know
that i am clumsy

119
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,979
I do things all the time that are clumsy

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,269
I fall down for no reason at all if
there is a crack in the sidewalk

121
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,630
I will be sure to trip on it and fall
down if I carry a plate of food in the

122
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,920
cafeteria

123
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,300
I almost always either drop it or bump
into someone with it

124
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't try to do these things it just
happens when i drink juice

125
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,630
i miss my mouth and get juice all over
my shirt

126
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,779
I always have something spilled on my
clothes

127
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,519
last week I opened a jar of peanut
butter the jar flew out of my hands and

128
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,130
landed upside down on the floor

129
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,260
there was a big glob of peanut butter on
the floor yesterday I knocked over the

130
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,310
sugar bowl

131
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,739
there was a big sticky mess on the floor
I bumped my head when I get into the car

132
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,899
I ripped my pants on things I lose my
money out of my pockets

133
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,670
I step on the cat's tail I always feel
bad when i do that because the cat

134
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,229
thinks I don't love her

135
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,10
I don't need to do these things I am
just a clumsy person

136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,120
my parents tell me to slow down

137
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,329
I am always in a hurry maybe that's why
I'm so clumsy

138
00:10:25,19 --> 00:10:28,380
maybe it's just the stage that I'm going
through

139
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,649
if it is I hope it is over soon

140
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,829
being clumsy is no fun at all

141
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,510
home alone I remember the first time
that my parents left me home alone

142
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,870
I was very grown-up and I thought that I
would be just fine

143
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,790
I was fine for a while i watch
television and had something to eat

144
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,910
I called my friend on the phone and we
talked for a while then I sat down to

145
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,50
read a book

146
00:11:03,50 --> 00:11:06,410
the house was quiet very quiet

147
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,530
I found myself listening very carefully

148
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:14,000
I heard a tap tap tapping noise I
wondered where it was coming from

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,670
it seemed to be coming from the window I
turned out the lights so that nobody

150
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,150
would see me and I peeked out the window
carefully

151
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,600
I was expecting to see a robber tapping
at my window

152
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,940
there was nobody there it was just a
tree branch swaying in the breeze and

153
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,270
tapping at my window I felt silly

154
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,630
I turned on the lights and sat back down
to read my book

155
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,440
a few minutes later I heard some
creaking noises

156
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,270
I listen carefully then I heard a
clunking noise

157
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,510
I think it might have been the furnace
then there was a whirring noise my

158
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,150
imagination began to play tricks on me

159
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,500
I was imagining that there were all
kinds of creatures in the house

160
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,810
I told myself to grow up I wouldn't let
my imagination run away with me

161
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,840
I was glad when my parents got home I
told them about all the noises that i

162
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,340
had heard my parents laughed and said
that all houses make noises

163
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,10
we're usually just so busy that we don't
hear all the noises that go on

164
00:12:22,10 --> 00:12:25,490
I have stayed home alone many times now

165
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,570
I just ignore all the little creaks and
noises that I here

166
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,570
I'm still alert and listen for anything
suspicious

167
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,710
but i know that there are lots of noises
that are harmless that tree that taps of

168
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,260
my windows still frightens me sometimes
but I'm a lot braver now then I was the

169
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,260
first time that I stayed home alone

170
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,249
family what does the word family means
to you

171
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:06,310
the easiest way to define family is to
talk about who you are related to

172
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:13,540
usually there is a mom and a dad and
children who are brothers and sisters

173
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,349
this would be the core family then there
is the extended family which would

174
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:27,639
include grandparents aunts and uncles
cousins nieces and nephews and in-laws

175
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,680
people married to your brothers or
sisters husband or wife

176
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:41,50
however i think the word family has a
much deeper meaning the word family

177
00:13:41,50 --> 00:13:51,758
brings words to my mind like love
support help kindness fun love trips

178
00:13:51,759 --> 00:14:02,19
closeness love for giving sharing love
understanding respect and love

179
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:08,110
you'll notice one word that is repeated
over and over again love

180
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,990
I believe if a family has real love for
one another they will be able to

181
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,920
overcome any problems they may have
actually they may not have too many

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,339
problems if they all love and respect
one another

183
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,959
however there are things that cannot be
helped

184
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,319
like death sickness or accidents

185
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:37,809
it is during those hard times that our
families love helps them to go through

186
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:44,199
those experiences we had quite a few
children in my family there were

187
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,750
brothers and sisters which included an
adopted brother and a number of foster

188
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,990
children - I was also very fortunate
that I had both my mom and dad to live

189
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,379
with and do things like vacations
together we had a lot of fun and there

190
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,990
were sometimes of tears -

191
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,310
above all we love one another family is
a wonderful thing

192
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I am so lucky

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,600
my first job my first real job was
during my last year of high school I had

194
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,190
taken classes in various business
subjects in that last year of high

195
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,000
school

196
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,730
we could do a co-op that meant we could
work part of the time instead of going

197
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,540
to school it would count as a credit
towards our diploma

198
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,500
the place i got a job was at a men's
tailor shop

199
00:15:48,10 --> 00:15:53,620
the owners were a very nice older german
couple they had two other men working

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,60
for them to one of the men had had brain
surgery for cancer

201
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,349
he had a big long scar all around the
top of his head

202
00:16:03,70 --> 00:16:08,50
he told me all about it he was always
happy and full of fun

203
00:16:08,50 --> 00:16:13,930
I thought he was very brave the tailor
shop made suits to order one of the

204
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,969
salesmen would measure the man and the
customer would choose a fabric and style

205
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,190
for he or his wife

206
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,550
light the people in the back of the shop
would then cut and sew the suit suits

207
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,439
cost a lot of money

208
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,390
there were also suits already made that
the customer could buy instead if they

209
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,140
wished they could also rent suits or
tuxedos for weddings or parties i worked

210
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,580
at a little desk

211
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,500
I answered the phone wrote letters filed
papers and did some bookkeeping

212
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,500
it was about a mile walk from my school
to work i passed many clothing shops

213
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,870
that wasn't good because i spent a lot
of my money that I earned in those shops

214
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,230
I worked at the tailor shop for almost a
year

215
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,360
it was a good experience and helped me
get my next job with the United States

216
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,319
Navy

217
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,319
that was fun too

218
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,109
first trip away from home today I'm
going to my friends house

219
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,439
her name is Valerie this is going to be
my first trip away from home without my

220
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,720
parents my dad is driving me to
Valerie's house and i'll be staying

221
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,580
there for two weeks

222
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,39
her mom will drive me back home it takes
about one and a half hours to get there

223
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,110
I have to pack enough clothes for play
work and church

224
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,49
i hope i'll pack the right things of
course i have to remember my toothbrush

225
00:17:52,49 --> 00:17:53,760
and hairbrush

226
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,730
Valerie lives on a farm I'll be helping
her dad with milking the cows

227
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,820
I think we'll play up in the hayloft

228
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,309
after we have helped put that Bales into
the barn will be all bitchy when the job

229
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,149
is done

230
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,510
there are a lot of things to do on a
farm

231
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:19,260
her mom is a good cook and will feed us
well there is a nice pond where we can

232
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,760
go swimming

233
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,559
I mustn't forget my bathing suit I
wonder if the farm dog comes into the

234
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,960
pond to that would be funny

235
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,159
my dad and mom are giving me money just
in case we go shopping

236
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,49
I hope we do go shopping because i want
to buy lots of candy

237
00:18:37,49 --> 00:18:40,710
I won't tell my mom that oh dear

238
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,650
I hear dad yelling let's go I haven't
even finished packing my things yet i

239
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,890

get busy fast

240
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,890
bye

241
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:57,890
my job

242
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,340
I work at a conservation park called
balls falls

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I've only worked there for three weeks
now

244
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,370
I am a tour guide and I tell people the
history of all the old buildings there

245
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,110
somebody told me that one of the houses
i work in is haunted

246
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,370
now I get chills every time I walk into
that house

247
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,50
my boss told me that the stories are
real but i have an active imagination

248
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,490
balls balls is very beautiful

249
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,70
it has two different waterfalls the
upper falls and the Lower Falls there

250
00:19:34,70 --> 00:19:40,189
used to be tons of water cascading over
them which turned a big water wheel to

251
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,510
grind grain

252
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,700
however through the years the amount of
water has really lessened

253
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,710
I love working at balls balls because i
get to work outside a lot i'm getting a

254

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,720

crafts and thinking of fun new games to

256
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,830
play

257
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,720
