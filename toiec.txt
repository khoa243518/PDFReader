pushes you

494
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,180

strong a hurricane or tornado is very

495
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
dangerous

496
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,100

there will be snow flurries

499
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,270

of snow

500

forecast is wrong

505
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,790
the weatherman might say that it will be
a sunny day but then the clouds come in

506

and it rains

507
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,530

you must stop and all stop signs you
must also stop at a red light

302
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,909
a green light means go and a yellow
light means to be careful if you see a

303
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,830
sign that says school crossing

304
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,669

places where people cross the street

way

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,389
if you hear a siren behind you you must
pull over an emergency vehicle like a

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:11,300
police car or an ambulance might need to
get somewhere fast when a school bus

310
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,370
puts on its flashing signals

311
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,350

school bus because children may be

312
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,629
crossing the street from the bus

313
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,780
you should always obey the speed limit

314
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,170

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,418
would you play a tuba a trumpet or a
saxophone

321
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,379
perhaps you would prefer a stringed
instrument like a violin or cello

322
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,988
maybe you would enjoy percussion more
you could play the kettle drum

323

there are instruments that have
keyboards a piano and an organ have

things that you would hit with a stick

330
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,980

but she has red hair and i have dark
hair she has a loud voice and i have a

453

we wear the same size shoes and we both
have the same favorite color

458

disagree about things we are alike in

459
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:46,29
many ways and different in many ways if
we were all exactly the same the world

I am myself and i am glad that I'm
special

462
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:59,950
you are special to use your own special
talents and take the time to meet other

463
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,910
people

464
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,190
the world is made up of a lot of
different people and that's what makes

465
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,190
life exciting

466
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
my cat

467
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,610
I got my cat when she was just a tiny
kitten

468
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,840
I named her puff because her fur is soft
and fluffy

469
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,560
she has white fur butter tail

470
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,9
pause and ears are black she has a
little pink nose and yellow eyes

471
00:36:43,10 --> 00:36:46,760
she says meow whenever she wants a bowl
of milk

472
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,759
I feed her cat food and treats she
washes her face with her paw paw

473
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,160
when she is finished eating my whole
family loves her and we can tell that

474
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,359
she loves us

475
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:06,410
she loves to curl up in our laps she
purrs whenever we pet her she is very

476
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,850
playful

477
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,770
we sometimes roll out the piece of paper
and throw it to her she loves to chase

478
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,350
the paper and hit it with her paws

479
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,380
she also chases bugs last night she
chased a spider but she was afraid to

480
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,610
touch it at night she curls up in my bed
with me

481
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,50
she likes to be warm I have given her a
blanket of her own

482
00:37:30,50 --> 00:37:35,240
but when i put her on it her tail
twitches her tail twitches whenever

483
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,370
she's upset or angry

484
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,670
I know she doesn't want to be on her
blanket

485
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,710
she wants to be in my bed I let her into
my bed and she falls asleep

486
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,550
purring loudly

487
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,119
music

488
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,470
my family is very musical my father
plays the guitar he plays in a band the

489
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,538
band plays country music

490
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,809
my mother is a singer in the band

she also plays the piano I took the
flute in music class at school I play

I also sing in the school choir I have a
low voice

494
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,799
my sister has a high voice she is a
soprano at home

495
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:37,819
I like to practice the drums but my
mother says that it's too loud

496
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,619
sometimes I place so loudly that I break
a drumstick

497
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:46,519
I practice whenever she goes out

498
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,499
I would like to be in a rock band some
of my friends and I are thinking of

499
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,328
starting our own rock band

500
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:56,809
my sister is a very good piano player

501
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,349
she has won many awards at music
festivals

502
00:39:01,9 --> 00:39:06,259
she likes to play classical music but
sometimes i get her to play rock music

503
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:07,309
with me

504
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:10,549
she is also a very good singer

505
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,999
I like to sing with her we sing and
harmony

506
00:39:15,19 --> 00:39:18,49
I listen to music all the time on the
radio

507
00:39:18,49 --> 00:39:23,329
I know a lot of songs I can sing along
with most of the songs that come on the

508
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,230
radio

509
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:30,140
i memorize the lyrics of the songs my
sister and I sometimes get together and

510
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,390
sing our favorite songs

511
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,578
maybe someday we will start our own rock
band and i will be the drummer

512
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,330
spring

513
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:58,240
it rains a lot in the spring the trees
are full of buds and the flowers are

514
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,629
starting to bloom my favorite spring
flowers are tulips and daffodils the

515
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,490
birds come back from the south

516
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,859
I can always tell that spring is here
when I see my first Robin of the season

517
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,780
the Robins pull worms from the wet
ground when it isn't raining

518
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,410
my friends and I go outside and toss a
ball around

519
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,50
we look forward to the summer but we are
glad to get outside after the long

520
00:40:26,50 --> 00:40:26,950
winter

521
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,950
the air smells so fresh in the spring

522
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,939
my mother always tells me not to track
mud into the house

523
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,720
it's very muddy in our yard in the
springtime

524
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,410
I wipe my muddy feet before i go into
the house

525
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,529
there are a lot of puddles in my yard

526
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:49,900
I sometimes splash in the puddles and I
get wet and cold so i have to go into

527
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,740
the house

528
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,350
I like it when the snow has melted the
rain has stopped and the sun comes out

529
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,540
on sunny days

530
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,360
I always get together with my friends on
those days we either ride our bikes or

531
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,350
play ball

532
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,660
my parents like to go for walks on
spring evenings they also like to clean

533
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,339
up the yard in the spring

534
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:18,70
everyone seems to be outside the
springtime brings people out of their

535
00:41:18,70 --> 00:41:21,70
houses

536
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,29
the birthday party

537
00:41:29,29 --> 00:41:32,59

538
00:41:32,59 --> 00:41:32,859

Jane had her 10th birthday her house was
decorated with balloons and streamers

540
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,930

541
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,640
happy 10th birthday Jane written on it
there were ten candles on the cake

542
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:52,569
Jane blew out the candles and make a
wish

543
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:58,299
I wonder what she wished for your wish
won't come true if you tell anyone what

544
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:03,489
it was we saying happy birthday to you

games so I got a prize

546
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,710
we also swam in Jane swimming pool

547
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,180
Jane opened her gifts her gifts were
wrapped in bright paper and bows

548

compact discs some clothes and some

Jane thanks everyone we ate a lot of
food at Jane's party we had hot dogs

551

552
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,930
then we ate cake and ice cream we had
popped to drink

553
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,609

cream I was very full by the time the

554
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,808

555
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:46,930

good time I hope Jane had a happy 10th

557
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,440
birthday

558
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,970
my classroom

559
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,890
my classroom is a large room

560
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,000
it's full of brightly colored pictures
my teacher hangs pictures up all over

561
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,930
the walls

562
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,640
there are black boards at the front of
the room my teacher always has writing

563
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,379
all over the blackboards

564
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,100
sometimes the chalk squeaks when she
writes on the blackboard

565
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,110
we cover our ears when that happens our
classroom is full of desks

566
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,120
there are a lot of students in our class
our desks are full of books notebooks

567
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,470
and pens

568
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,000
I try to keep my desk neat but I have a
lot of things in there

569
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,370
my ruler and pencils are always falling
out of my desk at the back of the room

570
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,650
is a bookcase full of books we can sign
those books out and take them home to

571
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,470
read i have read a lot of the books I
like mysteries and biographies

572
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,509
so i have taken many of those home there
are also tables at the back of the room

573
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,90
that's where we do our artwork we spread
out big sheets of paper and use paints

574
00:44:08,90 --> 00:44:12,770
or crayons to make pictures sometimes we
cut things out of magazines with

575
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,620
scissors and we glue pictures to the
paper

576
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,620
I like our class after school

577
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,549
my friends and I often erase the
blackboards for the teacher then we take

578
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,660
the erasers outside and clap them
together to get the chalk dust out of

579
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,319
them

580
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,820
my friends and I walk home together and
talk about what we did in school and

581
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,820
what we're going to do after supper

582
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,670
vacation

583
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,619
my family and I went on vacation to Lake
here on the water is beautiful and blue

584
00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:01,69
there and the sand is nice and white the
week that we were there was very hot the

585
00:45:01,69 --> 00:45:04,250
Sun was hot but the water was still very
cold

586
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,780
I went swimming and tried to catch
little fish in my hands

587
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,630
I was careful not to get sunburned we
stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a

588
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,770
game room

589
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:20,900
I played pinball and video games
sometimes I like to swim in the hotel

590
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,650
pool

591
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:26,720
but i like the beach better I would lie
on a big beach towel and get warm

592
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,808
then i would jump in the water and cool
off

593
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:35,210
sometimes I would just lie on the sand
and watch the waves roll up on shore

594
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,530
I found some seashells and saw a crab
walking on the sand

595
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,900
at first I was a bit lonely because I
didn't know anyone there

596
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,529
it wasn't long before I met some other
kids my age

597
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,250
we built sand castles together and swim
in the lake

598
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,470
the other kids were from different towns
so we told each other stories about our

599
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,240
schools and friends

600
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,140
we found that we had a lot in common
even though we were from different

601
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,279
places

602
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,960
our families got together and went to
restaurants together we played

603
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,920
volleyball on the beach and we SAT
around a campfire at night and sang

604
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,880
songs at the campfire we would roast
marshmallows on a stick

605
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,130
I always burned my marshmallows that is
ok I like them that way

606
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,540
mostly we just swim in the lake until we
were very tired

607
00:46:27,49 --> 00:46:32,30
I was sorry when our vacation was over I
had a good time at like here on

608
00:46:32,30 --> 00:46:35,809

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,69
if he has a friends stay over one of
them can sleep on the top bunk and the

630
00:48:14,70 --> 00:48:16,200
other can sleep on the bottom bunk

631
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,410
you can see the backyard from his
bedroom window

632
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,470
there are rose bushes and a picnic table
in the back yard

633
00:48:23,70 --> 00:48:27,630
there is also a white fence that has a
gate in it in the basement

634
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:33,390
there is a recreation room this is where
we watch television and have friends

635
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:37,589
over to visit the larger room is also in
the basement

636
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,900
there's a washing machine and a dryer in
there beside our house is a garage

637
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,649
we keep the car in the garage whenever
the weather is bad

638
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,640
our house is just the right size for our
family friends are always welcome at our

639
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,640
house

640
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,609
my family

641
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:05,210
my grandparents are coming to visit us
from Calgary Alberta

642
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:11,480
my father is very happy because they are
his parents and he's glad that he will

643
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,349
see them

644
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:17,749
we don't see them very often because
calgary is a long way from Toronto my

645
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:19,910
grandparents have two sons

646
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:26,359
my father and my uncle bill uncle bill
is married to my aunt susan they have a

647
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:32,180
daughter who is my cousin my cousin is a
lot older than I so we do not have a lot

648
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,200
in common

649
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,499
they also have a son who is the same age
as me

650
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:41,808
he is my favorite cousin because we both
like the same television shows and the

651
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:43,9
same games

652
00:49:43,9 --> 00:49:48,349
I have two brothers and one sister my
brothers are both younger than I they

653
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:49,430
are twins

654
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:55,339
so they have the same birthday my sister
is one year older than I people say that

655
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:57,529
my sister and I look alike

656
00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:02,690
we both have blonde hair and blue eyes
my mother's parents live near us

657
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:08,29
they are my grandmother and grandfather
who visit us often my mother does not

658
00:50:08,29 --> 00:50:10,339
have any brothers or sisters

659
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:14,839
she is an only child I like it when all
my family is together

660
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:19,640
I don't have a lot of cousins like some
people do but I have fun with my

661
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,808
relatives my uncle will often take my
cousin and me to the movies

662
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,380
I like to take my grandparents for walks

663
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,480
so they can see my school and they can
meet my friends my parents talk to my

664
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,269
brothers and my sister and I a lot

665
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:41,58
we are a very close-knit family people
who have closed families are very lucky

666
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,450
winter

667
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,810
once the fall is over and the snowflake
start to fall

668
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,790
I get very excited I can hardly wait for
the ground to be covered with a blanket

669
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,410
of white snow

670
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,710
I put on my mittens my scarf my hat coat
and winter boots and I run out into the

671
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,329
fluffy snow

672
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:16,700
I have to be careful not to slip on the
ice it can get very icy and cold in the

673
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,720
winter

674
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,779
the first thing that I do is to build a
snowman

675
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:26,300
I sometimes build a snow fort to my
friends and I have a good snowball fight

676
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,440
we laugh a lot and our cheeks and noses
get very red

677
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,730
when we get too cold we go into the
house and have a cup of hot chocolate

678
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,609
my father fills the backyard with water
that freezes and turns into an ice rink

679
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,140
when the ice is hard enough my friends
and I get our skates and we go out on

680
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,790
the ice to play hockey

681
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:52,279
all of my friends on hockey sticks I am
usually the goalie and I have to keep

682
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,770
the puck from going into the net

683
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,830
my sister and her friends don't really
like to play hockey

684
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:03,200
they would rather just skate around on
the ice I took skating lessons so I

685
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,29
don't usually fall down

686
00:52:05,30 --> 00:52:09,140
my little brother is just learning to
skate so he falls down a lot

687
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:14,60
my father has to shovel the snow off the
paths and the driveway in the winter

688
00:52:14,60 --> 00:52:17,599
I help him shoveling snow is hard work

689
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,950
when my dad and I finish shoveling the
driveway we go into the house and warm

690
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,430
our hands and feet in front of the
fireplace

691
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,259
there is probably nothing more beautiful
than fresh fallen snow on the trees in

692
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,280
the morning when the Sun shines on the
snow it glistens

693
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,589
I like to leave my footprints in the
snow winter can be very beautiful and

694
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,589
exciting

695
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,538
autumn

696
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,450
some people call autumn the fall

697
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,759
all you can call it either one autumn is
the time when the leaves change color

698
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,680
they change from green to beautiful
shades of gold orange and red

699
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:06,619
it looks like an artist has come along
and painted all the trees the air starts

700
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:10,910
to get a little colder in the autumn we
begin to wear jackets or sweaters

701
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,770
we go back to school in the autumn the
teachers sometimes gets us to make leave

702
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:20,990
collections we collect different types
of leaves and make a display of them

703
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,759
autumn is the time when old friends get
back together and talk about what they

704
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,710
did on their summer vacations Halloween
comes in the autumn we dress up in

705
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,760
costumes

706
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,790
some of them are scary and some of them
are funny

707
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:39,560
we go from door to door and say Trick or
Treat and people give us candies

708
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,578
we wear masks on our faces and we have a
lot of fun

709
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:48,710
the autumn winds start to blow the wind
blows the leaves right off the trees

710
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,530
until the trees have bare branches

711
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,970
my friends and I have a lot of fun
outside before the winter leaves of

712
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:01,970
shivering we play football and soccer at
school after school we ride our bikes

713
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:06,410
through the piles of dry leaves the
leaves go flying through the air as we

714
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,670
drive through them

715
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,900
my parents rake the leaves up and put
them in a big pile

716
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,160
I like to jump in the big piles of
leaves but then my parents just have to

717
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,569
rake them up again

718
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:22,430
the skies get a little cloudier in the
autumn and we know that soon there will

719
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,419
be snow so we enjoy the brisk autumn
weather while we can

720
00:54:36,10 --> 00:54:38,640
summer

721
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,49
yeah who school is over we are free for
the summer

722
00:54:43,50 --> 00:54:43,320
my

723
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,880
friends and I run out on the last day of
school into the bright summer sun we

724
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,190
sing a song about no more pencils and no
more books we can hardly wait to do all

725
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,510
the summer things that we like to do we
go swimming we play baseball

726
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,210
we ride our bikes and we go to the beach
we go on vacations or some of us go to

727
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,380
summer camp

728
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,90
it is just nice to run barefoot through
the grass or lie on your back and look

729
00:55:09,90 --> 00:55:14,430
up at the clouds summer days are lazy
days we don't have to do school work

730
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:20,9
we listened to the buzzing of the bees
we watch the birds as they fly from tree

731
00:55:20,10 --> 00:55:24,750
to tree we go down to the pond and toss
rocks into the water

732
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:30,780
we eat ice cream and we have BBQ years
some of my friends parents have boats so

733
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,820
we go for rides in their boats

734
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:38,10
some of my friends go to their cottages
they have cottages on legs

735
00:55:38,10 --> 00:55:41,400
some of my friends even have summer jobs

736
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,160
my best friend works at a supermarket my
father pays me to do jobs for him

737
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,450
I cut the grass take out the garbage and
wash the car

738
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,589
I like to be outside in the sunshine on
Sundays

739
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,550
my mother will pack a picnic lunch and
we go down to the park

740
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:04,410
sometimes we play baseball there is also
a tennis court at the park

741
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:09,750
I'm a very good tennis player my sister
just likes to swing on the swings and

742
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,340
slide down the slide

743
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,80
we eat our sandwiches and watch out for
the ants that always seem to be a pic

744
00:56:16,80 --> 00:56:18,450
mix after we have our lunch

745
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,720
my sister and I run off to play with the
other children

746
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,779
my dad has a nap and my mother read her
book my skin gets Brown from the Sun in

747
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,140

that come with the Summer Sun summer is

749
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,250

750
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,250
I wish summer could go on forever

751
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,770
the doctor

752
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,970
I didn't feel very well last week I had
a sore throat and a fever

753
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:07,189
my mother took me to see the doctor when
we got there the nurse took my name and

754
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,710
said that the doctor would be with me
soon

755
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,950
the doctor was a very nice man in a
white jacket

756
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,870
I had seen the doctor before when i had
my tonsils out at the hospital the

757
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,569
doctor took a light and looked in my
ears

758
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,290
he put a stick on my tongue and he shone
his light into my mouth

759
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:30,350
he looked at my throat he said that my
throat was a bit swollen and red

760
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,770
he felt my neck and said my glands were
swollen

761
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,40
he took my temperature and said that it
was quite high

762
00:57:37,40 --> 00:57:40,550
he listened to my heart and he made me
cough

763
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:45,50
he asked me some questions he said he
might have to do some tests

764
00:57:45,50 --> 00:57:48,380
he sent me to get some blood taken out
of my arm

765
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,780
I was scared but it didn't really hurt
the doctor gave me some pills and told

766
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,60
me to take one in the morning and one at
night he told me to drink lots of fluids

767
00:57:59,60 --> 00:58:04,580
he told me to get plenty of sleep I did
exactly what the doctor told me to do it

768
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:09,350
wasn't very long before I was feeling
well again I think that I might like to

769
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:12,799
be a doctor when I grow up I would like
to make people feel better

770
00:58:26,99 --> 00:58:29,519
the dentist

771
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,899
my friend's father is a dentist he has
an office near my house

772
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:39,89
I went to see him on thursday his nurse
told me to sit in a very big chair

773
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:45,659
she tied a bit under my chin the dentist
came in he examined my teeth with some

774
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:47,399
shiny silver tools

775
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,819
he looked at my front teeth and my back
teeth

776
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:54,58
he told me that the back teeth were
called molars

777
00:58:54,59 --> 00:58:59,99
he told me to open wide he had a little
mirror that he used to look at my teeth

778
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,29
he said that I had good strong teeth

779
00:59:03,29 --> 00:59:07,890
he told me that I didn't have any
cavities I told him that I didn't need a

780
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,609
lot of candies and that I always brush
my teeth after every meal

781
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:18,118
he said that was very good he asked me
if i flossed my teeth and I said yes I

782
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,279
use dental floss every day he told me
that my teeth were healthy because i

783
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:25,259
took very good care of them

784
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:28,499
he left and told me to keep up the good
work

785
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:32,759
the dental hygienist came in and she
said that she would clean my teeth for

786
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:33,419
me

787
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:38,98
she's great my teeth with a sharp tool
and then she put some polish on my teeth

788
00:59:38,99 --> 00:59:43,289
and began to clean them when she was
done she told me to spit into a bowl and

789
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,659
then I rinse my mouth out with water

790
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:51,299
I looked into a mirror and saw that my
teeth were very shiny and white if I

some people will sew costumes and some
people will be makeup artists

798
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:30,310
the teacher is the director of the play

799
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,730

814
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,440

815
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,540
this is a musical play and the trees and
flowers will sing to Hansel and Gretel

816
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,670
as they walk through the forest

817
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:39,140
I can hardly wait for opening night I
want my family and friends to see me

818
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,520
acting on stage

819
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,380
I hope they will like the play we have
all learned our lines and worked very

820
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,380
hard at making this play a success

821
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,560
emotions

822
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,790
do you ever think about your emotions
what kinds of things make you sad

823
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:14,230
I get sad when i get a bad mark in
school or when someone that I like moves

824
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,950
away

825
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,980
I sometimes see sad movies that make me
cry

826
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,280
I don't like to be sad I don't like to
have a frown on my face

827
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:28,149
I like to be happy I'm happy most of the
time parties make me happy being with my

828
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,680
friends makes me happy

829
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,609
lots of things make me happy if someone
tells me a joke

830
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:38,170
i laughs I enjoy laughing funny movies
make me laugh

831
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,350
I think that people look the best when
they smile

832
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:45,580
what kinds of things make you mad I get
mad when my brother breaks one of my

833
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,509
toys

834
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:51,250
I try not to show it when I get mad my
parents get mad at me if i come home

835
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:51,940
light

836
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:57,400
I don't think anger is a good emotion it
is best to stay calm and talk things

837
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,270
over

838
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,930
emotions come from inside you but they
show on your face

839
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:05,799
people can tell when you're mad or sad
or happy

840
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:13,29
I prefer to look happy sometimes I even
smile when I'm feeling sad and the smile

841
01:03:13,30 --> 01:03:16,30
makes me feel a little better

842
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,430

there are cans of things which also need
to be placed on the shelves yesterday

857
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,40
the lie

858
01:04:34,40 --> 01:04:36,300
yesterday I told

859
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,520
I don't feel very good about it I was
bouncing a ball in the kitchen and the

860
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,130
ball bounced up and broke up

861
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:50,100
it was one of my mother's best cops so I
was afraid that she would be mad i put

862
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,480
the broken cut back on the table and I
didn't tell anyone that I had broken it

863
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,650
that night my mother asked who had
broken the cup

864
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,30
my brother said not me my sister said I
didn't do it

865
01:05:03,30 --> 01:05:07,170
I said I didn't break the cup but I was
lying

866
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,740
my mother said that we would all be
punished if someone didn't tell the

867
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,290
truth and say who broke the cup

868
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:18,180
I still did not tell her that I had
broken it she gave us one more chance

869
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,629
and she said she wasn't mad about the
cup

870
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,380
she just wanted us to be honest I still
didn't say anything

871
01:05:26,70 --> 01:05:31,110
my brother sister and I all got sent to
our rooms we had to stay in our rooms

872
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,190
all morning

873
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:37,530
my brother said it wasn't fair I felt
very bad because my brother and sister

874
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,600
were being punished because of me

875
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,680
I went to my mother and told her that I
had broken the cop

876
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,40
she said that she was not upset about
the broken Cup

877
01:05:47,40 --> 01:05:52,350
she knew that it was an accident she was
disappointed in me because I hadn't come

878
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,509
forward and told the truth

879
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,380
she said that she wouldn't have punished
me if I had been honest with her

880
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,590
I told my brother and sister that I was
sorry

881
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,430
I felt bad because they were punished
because i was dishonest

882
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,390
I told my mother that I was sorry that I
had lied to her

883
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:13,859
I told her that I had learned a lesson
honesty is the best policy

884
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,320
it is better to tell the truth it is not
a good feeling when people don't trust

885
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,10
you

886
01:06:20,10 --> 01:06:25,470
I have learned that lying just hurts
people sometimes it is hard to be honest

887
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,569
but it is the best way to be

1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,920

trees smell nice

35
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,250
but you have to be careful that they
don't dry out and start a fire

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,260
this year we have an artificial tree we

we place gifts under the tree there is a
gift for me under the tree

54
00:03:40,40 --> 00:03:41,840
afford to have Christmas

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,350
my family is collecting things for a
poor family who live near here

56
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,000
we had fun deciding which toys to buy
for the children in that family

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,260
it was a good feeling to share with
people who do not have as much as you do

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,179
my parents have always taught us that
christmas is a time for giving not

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,40
receiving I think that

60
00:04:01,40 --> 00:04:04,40
right

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,769
the garden

62
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,800
the garden is very interesting

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,920
I sometimes go outside and i watch all
the things that go on in the garden

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,520
it smells wonderful in the flower garden

65
00:04:24,30 --> 00:04:30,419
there are red white pink and yellow
roses that have a sweet smell

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,489
i watch the bees as they take pollen
from the roses

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,510
there are tiny bugs that live on the
rose bushes

68
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,780
my mother tries to get rid of the little
bugs but it is difficult to get rid of

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,500
them

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,480
she is glad to see the red lady bugs who
eat the little bugs the birds like the

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,710
sunflowers

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,620
they like to eat sunflower seeds there
is a bird bath in the garden

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,750
the Blackbirds and swallows go in there
to take a drink or have a bath

74
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,700
I sometimes see a Robin or a blue jay in
there too

75
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,420
in the dirt there are little holes where
the ants go in and out

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,250
the ants are hard workers i watch them
as they work together as a team to bring

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,930
food to their nests there are snails in
the garden -

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,830
they carry their homes on their backs
they move slowly and leave a silvery

79
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,109
trail as they go they eat the leaves
from my mother's plants

80
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,670
my mother also has vegetables growing in
her garden

81
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,380
she grows green peas we like to pick
those and eat the peas raw right out of

82
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,580
their pods

83
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,580
she grows lettuce and tomatoes -

84
00:06:00,90 --> 00:06:05,369
we have so many tomatoes that we always
give some to our neighbors

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,530
my mother sends us outside to pick
lettuce and tomatoes

86
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:17,669
whenever we have a salad my favorite
vegetables are carrots their tops grow

87
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,240
above the earth

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,550
but the carrots are below the dirt when
you pick them you have to pull the

89
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:32,80
carrots out from under the soil weeds
also grow in the garden after a good

90
00:06:32,80 --> 00:06:33,219
rain fall

91
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,490
it seems that the weeds just spring up

92
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,509
I pull the weeds out by their roots so
they won't grow back

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,90
weeds choke the good plants so we don't
want them in our garden

94
00:06:46,90 --> 00:06:54,638
gardening is a good hobby you get fresh
air sunshine and exercise you even get

95
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
beautiful colorful flowers and nice
fresh food

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,950
the pet store

97
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,979
on Saturday my parents took us to the
pet store

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,80
they had everything that you would need
if you had a pet

99
00:07:25,80 --> 00:07:32,490
they had dog food collars and leashes
for dogs they had treats to give your

100
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:40,620
dog and brushes to brush your dog for
cats they had food toys and litter boxes

101
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,910
for birds they had seed and cages

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,190
there was a section for fish they had
fish in big tanks and little bowls in

103
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,450
the big tanks

104
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,270
there were colorful fish swimming around
the girl who worked there said that they

105
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,120
were tropical fish there were gold fish
in the smaller fish bowls

106
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,560
I saw the girl get a goldfish out with a
little net

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,160
she sold it to a boy who said he had
another goldfish at home there was a

108
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,520
very large cage with a parrot in it

109
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,270
I walked up to the cage and the parents
said hello

110
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,929
I was surprised that the parrot could
talk

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,490
it could say a few things it said I love
you

112
00:08:33,30 --> 00:08:39,839
pretty bird and bye bye I told my mother
that I would like a parrot

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,470
but she said that parents need a lot of
care and attention at the back of the

114
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,310
store

115
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,910
there were some puppies they seemed glad
to see me

116
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,170
I stuck my hand into the cage and one of
them licked my hand

117
00:08:56,40 --> 00:09:03,30
they were very lively they were running
around and chasing their own tails in

118
00:09:03,30 --> 00:09:04,290
the next cage

119
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,770
there were two kittens one of them was
playing with a toy and the other one was

120
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,730
asleep

121
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,820
the kittens were very small the one that
was sleeping was curled up into a ball

122
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,410
I couldn't even see her face

123
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,629
I didn't want to leave the pet store I
was wishing that I could take all of the

124
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,629
animals home with me

125
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,370
my first day of school

126
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,730
I remember my first day of school

127
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,000
I was excited but I was afraid I held my
mother's hand as we walk to the school

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
when we got near the school

129
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,400
I wouldn't let her hold my hand anymore
I didn't want to look like a baby

130
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,319
we got to the school the school looked
very big and frightening

131
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,490
there were children outside on the
playground

132
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:15,660
they all looked very big I looked at
them and some of them looked at me I

133
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,579
felt very small

134
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,680
my mother and I went into the school and
found the kindergarten room

135
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,620
there were children in their most of
them were the same size as me

136
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,470
my mother spoke to the kindergarten
teacher the teacher was very nice

137
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,60
she said my name and she introduced me
to some of the other children

138
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,400
I already knew some of the children
because they lived near me

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,140
I began to play with some of the things
that were in the classroom

140
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,540
there were tight rucks coloring books
and even a dull house

141
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,490
I soon forgot to be scared and I began
to play with the other children

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,690
I didn't even notice that my mother had
left the room

143
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,980
in school we sang songs played some
games and listened as the teacher read

144
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,89
us a story

145
00:11:12,89 --> 00:11:15,89
I had a lot of fun on my first day of
school

146
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,199
I even drew a picture of my teacher

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,370
I took the picture home and my mother
put it on the refrigerator

148
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,20
I like school it is a good place to meet
new friends and learn all about the

149
00:11:31,20 --> 00:11:34,20
world

150
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,780
transportation

151
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,529
people move from place to place there
are lots of ways you can move around

152
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,200
from one place to another

153
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,410
sometimes you can just move your feet
and walk walking is good for you

154
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:07,550
some places are too far to walk to you
might have to ride a bicycle or ride on

155
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,170
a skateboard

156
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:15,290
some places are too far away to ride
your bicycle to you might have to drive

157
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,610
in a car or a van or even a truck

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,940
my father has a car my uncle has a van

159
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,709
I have never been in a big truck trucks
are usually used to carry big loads from

160
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,540
one city to another

161
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,599
I would like to be a truck driver

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,670
I would travel all over and sit high up
in the cab

163
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,729
I have been in a taxicab

164
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,630
once my mother and i took a taxi to the
hospital

165
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,440
there was a special meter in the taxi
when we finished our taxi ride the

166
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,240
driver looked at the meter to find out
how much money we owed him

167
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,610
I once rode a horse i sat in the saddle
and held on tight to the reins the horse

168
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,440
ran very fast

169
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,60
it was a bumpy ride and I was afraid
that I would fall off the horse

170
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,980
not too many people around here use
horses for transportation

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,000
they used to use horses for
transportation in the old days if you

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,520
want to travel very far away

173
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,600
you have to go on a train a plane or a
boat

174
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,949
if you are in a hurry it is best to take
a plane planes fly through the air

175
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,880
very fast trains go along the tracks

176
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:54,209
sometimes I can hear the train whistle
from my house boats take a long time to

177
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,919
cross the ocean

178
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,720
great big boats that cross the oceans
are called ships

179
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,289
if you like to take it easy and look out
at the water than ships are a good way

180
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,609
to travel

181
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:15,449
they say that the world is a lot smaller
now because of Transportation people can

182
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:19,378
travel to all parts of the world quickly
and easily

183
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,399
the world is not really smaller but it
has become easy to get to faraway places

184
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,470
television

185
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,270
do you watch television my mother says
that i watch too much television

186
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,560
i watch cartoons on saturday mornings

187
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,979
cartoons make me laugh my brother and I
each have our favorite cartoons

188
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:07,240
we have trouble deciding which cartoons
we will watch on Saturday afternoons we

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,220
like to watch sports

190
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,710
my brother really likes to watch
baseball but usually my mother tells us

191
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,890
to go out and play on a Saturday
afternoon on weeknights

192
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,980
we have our own favorite shows I like
shows about outer space and monsters

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,810
my brother likes comedies he likes to
laugh my mother like shows about real

194
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,459
life situations

195
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,580
she likes to watch the news she says
that the news is important

196
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,170
she watches the news and weather to find
out what is going on in the world

197
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,900
sometimes she watches real-life shows
about doctors or policemen

198
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,829
my father doesn't watch television

199
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,720
he says that he would rather read a good
book or the newspaper

200
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,620
my dad gets all his news from the
newspaper

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,90
my favorite thing is to sit in front of
the television with a bag of popcorn and

202
00:16:13,90 --> 00:16:18,430
a bottle of pop I sit there and change
the channels with the remote control

203
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,50
I change channels and watch a few
different shows at once

204
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,710
my mother won't let me watch too much
television

205
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,460
she doesn't want me to get lazy
television is good if you don't spend

206
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,410
too much time watching it you can learn
a lot from television

207
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:44,770
if you watch the educational channels I
learned about dinosaurs and rainforest

208
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,790
last week

209
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,790
just from watching television

210
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,449
my country

211
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,898
i live in canada it is a very large
country that is made up of ten provinces

212
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,658
and three territories

213
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:18,600
most of the provinces and territories
are quite unique for example in

214
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,859
Saskatchewan

215
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,309
the land is flat and it is not
surrounded by water

216
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,970
they grow wheat in Saskatchewan British
Columbia has mountains

217
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,590
I have never been to British Columbia
but I hear that it is very beautiful

218
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,518
nova scotia is on the Atlantic Ocean

219
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,428
so there are many fishermen out there
the people in the provinces are even

220
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:50,669
different from each other in Quebec many
of the people speak french in the

221
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,460
Maritime Provinces the people like to
play their own kind of music they play

222
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,720
fiddles and accordions and many of them
dance very well known of it is in the

223
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,590
north

224
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,899
so life is quite different they're the
people who live in the new territory of

225
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,899
Nunavut are very close to wildlife

226
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,340
they do a lot of hunting and fishing it
can get very cold up in the Arctic where

227
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:28,289
none of it is i live in ontario even
within Ontario life can be quite

228
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,279
different

229
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:36,419
the capital of ontario is toronto
toronto is a very busy city with lots of

230
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,600
apartments offices and shops

231
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,709
toronto is an exciting place and it has
a lot to offer

232
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,459
there are theaters and restaurants to
suit every taste the culture in toronto

233
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,559
is very diverse

234
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,928
if you drive a few miles north of
Toronto you will find places that are

235
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:04,710
tranquil and peaceful many people leave
Toronto on the weekends and drive to

236
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,889
their cottages where they find rest and
relaxation

237
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,659
canada is made up of many different
cultures

238
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,80
people of many different ethnic
backgrounds live in harmony in Canada

239
00:19:19,80 --> 00:19:24,750
that is why i like Canada in Canada we
celebrate our differences

240
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,168
food

241
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,619
what kind of food do you like to eat

242
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,389
I am lucky because in Canada there are
many foods to choose from

243
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:51,39
I like to eat hot dogs hamburgers &
steak

244
00:19:51,609 --> 00:20:00,39
these are all meat products i also like
cheese ice cream and yogurt these are

245
00:20:00,39 --> 00:20:02,289
all dairy products

246
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:10,59
I like vegetables my favorite vegetables
are broccoli cabbage carrots and peas

247
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:19,119
I eat a lot of fruit I eat which ever
fruit is in season in strawberry season

248
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,480
I eat a lot of strawberries in peach
season

249
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:30,249
I eat many peaches sometimes my mother
will make a peach pie many different

250
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:36,639
crops grow in canada we have many
orchards and farms fresh fruit and

251
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:43,748
vegetables are plentiful in Canada meat
and fish are also plentiful here in

252
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:49,840
canada we have a lot of different foods
to choose from in my city there are a

253
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,238
lot of Italian restaurants

254
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:56,559
my favorite food at the italian
restaurant is pizza

255
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,730
my parents would rather have spaghetti
or lasagna

256
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,230
there are Greek restaurants mexican
restaurants and chinese restaurants in

257
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,590
fact there are restaurants from most
cultures

258
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,139
I can go around from restaurant to
restaurant and pretend that I am

259
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,580
traveling the world and trying all the
different foods from around the world

260
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,600
sometimes I eat things that aren't good
for me

261
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,389
I eat potato chips and candies these
foods aren't part of a nutritious diet

262
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,389
but they are fun to eat

263
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,870
the zoo

264
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,260
my class took a trip to the Toronto Zoo

265
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,870
I

266
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,909
I had a wonderful time they're my
favorite animals were the Lions

267
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,120
they look very powerful and strong

268
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,510
they say that the lion is the king of
the forest and I think that title suits

269
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,379
him

270
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,290
the monkeys were funny they were looking
at us just as much as we looked at them

271
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,720
they were swinging from branches and
doing tricks to impress us

272
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,980
there was a baby monkey that was
clinging to its mother's back

273
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,440
it was very cute the Tigers were pacing
back and forth

274
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,290
they seemed Restless the stripes on a
tiger are very beautiful

275
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:42,10
we watched the toll giraffes as they
nibbled leaves off the tallest trees

276
00:22:42,10 --> 00:22:49,210
we spoke to a colorful parrot that spoke
back to us we saw exotic animals that we

277
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,70
had never seen before

278
00:22:51,70 --> 00:22:56,320
some of them were very strange there
were different types of bears they're

279
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,780
there were black bears

280
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,809
I saw a black bear once when I was
camping up north we saw polar bears

281
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,649
polar bears are white they like the cold

282
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,220
we even saw panda bears one of my
friends bought a toy panda bear from the

283
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,120
gift shop because she thought that the
pandas were so cute

284
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,630
we saw slippery snakes some of the
snakes had very bright skins

285
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:31,270
most of the girls were afraid of the
snakes the zookeeper was looking after

286
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,840
the snakes and one of them hissed at him
he has to be very careful when he works

287
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,980
with the snakes

288
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,570
the last thing that we saw at the zoo
was the elephant

289
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,870
he was enormous he looked at us

290
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,660
then he raised his trunk and made a loud
sound it made us jump

291
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
the museum

292
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,50
the museum was very interesting there
were so many things in the museum that I

293
00:24:13,50 --> 00:24:16,800
would need more time to really see
everything

294
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,200
there were clothes from the past I don't
know how people wore some of those

295
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,230
things they look like they would be
uncomfortable

296
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,340
I like to wear my jeans

297
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,850
there were things from Wars there were
bullets and cannons and even uniforms

298
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,350
from the soldiers

299
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:43,590
I don't think that war is a good thing
but it is good to remember the past and

300
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,919
honor the people who died for your
country

301
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,920
there was an old fire truck at the
Museum this fire truck was pulled by a

302
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,940
horse

303
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,890
there were some very old photographs of
the firemen putting out fires

304
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,960
there were rooms in the museum that were
set up like an old house

305
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,280
there were antique irons and sewing
machines

306
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,120
the women used to clean the clothes with
a washboard

307
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,139
there were no modern appliances back
then

308
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm glad that we have electricity and
modern appliances the things that we

309
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,560
have make life so much easier

310
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,340
there were mummies from Egypt at the
Museum

311
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,370
I was fascinated by those there were
artifacts from the Indians

312
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,439
there were arrowheads and cradles that
the babies slept in

313
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,970
I tried my best to see everything but it
was almost impossible

314
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,460
the museum is a good place to learn
about your past

315
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,410
I tried to imagine my grandparents using
some of the things that were on display

316
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,410
at the Museum

317
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
the police

318
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,540
my mother always told me that if I was
lost I could go up to a policeman and

319
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,000
that he would help me to find my way
home I never did get lost

320
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,620
but I always remembered what my mother
told me about the police

321
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,580
I think policeman look very nice in
their uniforms

322
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,570
I see police officers drive by in their
police cars in my town

323
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:48,429
we even have police officers on bicycles
policeman and police women have a job

324
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,190
that can sometimes be dangerous

325
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,190
they have to catch people who break the
law

326
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:01,600
sometimes they have to chase people or
try to calm people down to be a police

327
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,500
officer

328
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,140
you need a lot of training it's
important to be able to deal with people

329
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,250
effectively a police officer came to our
school

330
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,970
he had a police dog with him

331
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,930
the officer showed us how the dog could
track down criminals

332
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,930
the dog was very smart he could even
find things that were hidden

333
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,230
criminals sometimes hide things that
they don't want the police to find the

334
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,610
policeman told us that he and his dog
were partners

335
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,620
his dog lives at his house with the
policeman and his family

336
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,750
sometimes I see police cars on the side
of the road

337
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,000
the police stopped at people who are
speeding or are not wearing their

338
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,230
seatbelts

339
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,160
the police officers warn people or give
out tickets

340
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,390
sometimes they even have to arrest
people

341
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:09,220
police officers are just doing their job
when they arrest people some people need

342
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,20
to be arrested and put in jail to make
it safer for the rest of us

343
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:26,418
pretending

344
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,169
I like to pretend i like to make up
things that aren't real

345
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:34,159
I use my imagination I was pretending
that i was in a time machine

346
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,529
I set the date for a prehistoric time I
turned on the time machine and it buzzed

347
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,909
in Word and spud madly when it stopped
spinning i opened the door and stepped

348
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,129
out into a very thick jungle

349
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,359
I listened carefully to the sounds of
the jungle I could hear strange animal

350
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,830
noises and the leaves were rustling I
wasn't sure if I'd gone back in time or

351
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,830
just landed in a jungle somewhere in the
21st century

352
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,230
it didn't take me long to realize that I
had indeed gone back in time a very

353
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,950
strange bird-like creature with a large
beak flew overhead

354
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,779
I've never seen anything like it in my
life I took a few steps out into the

355
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,460
long grass and ferns

356
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I didn't want to go too far away from my
time machine

357
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,259
I heard a noise over on my right side
there was a man who looked quite

358
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,340
different from me

359
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,340
he was dressed in an animal skin and he
carried a big stick

360
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:29,149
I didn't want him to see me so I hid
behind a tree

361
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,379
he didn't speak any language that i
could understand he grunted at someone

362
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:35,238
who must have been in the distance

363
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,450
then I felt the earth shake beneath my
feet

364
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,559
I heard giant thumps on the ground as
the floor of the jungle shook the man

365
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,779
and the animal skin began to run

366
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,279
I saw why he was running a giant
dinosaur appeared above the tops of the

367
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,29
trees

368
00:29:50,29 --> 00:29:54,710
it was bigger than anything I'd ever
seen my heart began to pound my chest it

369
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,90
was coming toward me

370
00:29:56,90 --> 00:30:00,590
I ran toward my time machine and jumped
in I set the dial for the 21st century

371
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,90
the Machine word and buzzed my time
machine landed in the 21st century

372
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
I got away just in time

373
00:30:17,10 --> 00:30:19,450
a baby

374
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,309
my and just had a baby girl

375
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,999
we went to the hospital to visit my end
and to see the new baby

376
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,840
my aunt was feeling fine although she
was just a bit tired

377
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,759
she walked with us to a big window that
had lots of babies behind it

378
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,769
she pointed to a crib with a baby in it
the baby was wrapped in a pink blanket

379
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:42,639
we all said how pretty the baby looked I
couldn't believe how tiny the baby was

380
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:47,498
she was asleep so we couldn't see her
eyes when the baby went home

381
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:51,700
we went to visit her we heard the baby
she was crying

382
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,320
my aunt said the baby was hungry my aunt
had a baby bottle full of warm milk

383
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,320
she fed the baby with it the baby was
happy after that my and patted the baby

384
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,460
on the back until the baby burp and then
the baby fell asleep

385
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,289
I held the baby I looked at her tiny
fingers and tiny toes

386
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,340
I was very careful with her she opened
her eyes and looked at me

387
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,549
I spoke to the baby but I knew that she
could not understand me

388
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,330
babies have to learn to walk and talk

389
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,39
my aunt change the baby babies wear
diapers so they need to be changed often

390
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:32,769
the baby has a lot of toys but she is
still too young to play with them by and

391
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,999
says that it won't be long before the
baby is crawling and trying to talk

392
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:42,340
babies are cute I have seen pictures of
myself when I was a baby and it's hard

393
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
to believe that I was once that small

394
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,640
a wedding

395
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,380
the church bells are ringing I am inside
the church waiting for my cousin to walk

396
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,430
down the aisle

397
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:08,190
today is her wedding day she has a bride
the organist is playing a song on the

398
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,910
organ

399
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,420
we all stand up and watch my cousin walk
down the aisle

400
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,860
she is our man armed with her father she
is dressed in a long white dress and

401
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,879
veil

402
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,330
she looks so beautiful she looks like a
princess

403
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,350
the man who she is going to marry is
standing at the front of the church

404
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,740
he is the groom he looks nice too he is
wearing a suit and he has a flower in

405
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,760
his lapel

406
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,90
the minister says words to the couple
which will make them man and wife

407
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,860
the bride and groom smile at each other
but they seem to be a little bit nervous

408
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,680
they give each other gold rings - where
to symbolize that they are married they

409
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,670
kiss each other and walk out of the
church as the organist plays joyous

410
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,570
music

411
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,439
some of the people in the church cried
at the wedding but not because they were

412
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,340
sad

413
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,470
everyone in the church is very happy for
the couple a photographer takes pictures

414
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,760
of the happy couple

415
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,570
we wish them well and look forward to
the reception where we will have dinner

416
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,50
and we will dance and have a good time
until it is very late

417
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,150
the bride will throw her bouquet of
flowers and it is said whoever catches

418
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,760
the bouquet will be the next bride

419
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,790
the next day the bride and groom will
leave for their honeymoon

420
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,540
my cousin and her husband are going to
Mexico for their honeymoon

421
00:33:35,10 --> 00:33:37,870
my dad

422
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,870
my dad is the man whom I respect the
most in my life

423
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,919
he works very hard to make the money
that supports us

424
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,130
my mother has a job too and she also
works very hard

425
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,100
my dad is the principal of a high school
he works at the school all day and often

426
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,230
has to go to meetings at night

427
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,910
he deals with parents students and staff
there was always something that he has

428
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,990
to deal with

429
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:07,690
he has a lot on his mind it doesn't
matter how much work my dad has to do he

430
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,610
always has time for my brother's my
sister and me if I go to him with a

431
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,360
problem

432
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,720
you will sit down and discuss it with me
he doesn't yell

433
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,859
he is always very logical and he tries
to think of the best way to deal with

434
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,700
things

435
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,830
my dad is a very patient man once I
spilled some ink on papers that he was

436
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,819
working on

437
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,850
I thought he would be mad but he didn't
get angry he said it was ok he takes

438
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,529
time out to do things with us

439
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,120
he has taken my brother's fishing he
takes me to the arena to skate and he

440
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,120
helps my sister to write your essays and
assignments

441
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,549
he always makes us laugh he makes us
feel like we are very special to him he

442
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,870
is a very good father and on father's
day I always buy him a car that tells

443
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,759
them just how much he means to me

444
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,60
I think it is important to have good
parents

445
00:34:58,60 --> 00:35:02,170
I hope that when I have children I will
be a good parent like my parents are to

446
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,40
me

447
00:35:03,40 --> 00:35:06,460
parents give children the foundation
they need to live good lives

448
00:35:19,30 --> 00:35:21,530
my mother

449
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,970
my mother does so many things she has a
job at a dress store

450
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,250
she cooks our meals she cleans the house
she feeds the pets and she still finds

451
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,780
time to spend with us

452
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,610
my mother is always busy but she says
that her favorite time is time that she

453
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,780
spends with us

454
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,460
my mother works from monday to friday
when she comes home from work she makes

455
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,80
something for supper

456
00:35:45,80 --> 00:35:49,910
we usually do the dishes so that she
won't have to do them after supper she

457
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,60
helps us with our homework or she sits
down to watch television

458
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,680
some nights she go shopping and she
takes whoever wants to go with her

459
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,680
mother's are a little bit of everything

460
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,730
my mother is like a teacher when she
helps us with our homework

461
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,770
she is like a nurse when she looks after
us all when were ill she is like a cook

462
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,420
when she makes meals for us

463
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,160
she says that cleaning the house is
released favorite thing she says that

464
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,859
the house gets dirty again right after
you clean it

465
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,200
she gets my father my brothers sister
and me to help her with the cleaning my

466
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,759
mother washes all our clothes and
sometimes she irons them if they need it

467
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,970
my mother says that there are not enough
hours in a day

468
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,560
we try to help my mother as much as we
can there's a lot of work involved in

469
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,900
keeping a home neat and organized

470
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,730
most of my friends mother's work mothers
are the people who you go to when you

471
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,300
need to be comforted mothers are the
people who could make you feel better

472
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,910
i'm glad that i have the mother that I
have my mother is caring and funny

473
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,910
she has fun to be around

474
00:37:06,99 --> 00:37:08,880
a surprise

475
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,259
last Friday my dad came home from work
and said that he had a surprise for us

476
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,879
we tried to guess what the surprise
might be my brother gets that we were

477
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,230
going out for dinner

478
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,180
my dad said no my other brother asked if
my father had tickets to a hockey game

479
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,980
my dad said no my sister asked if we're
going on a trip

480
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:34,619
my dad said no my mother knew what the
surprise was so she just stood and

481
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,609
smiled at us

482
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:41,220
I guess that we might be getting a
swimming pool my dad said no we were

483
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,660
getting very frustrated trying to guess
what the surprise might be my brother

484
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,339
asked how big the surprise was my dad
said that the surprise was quite small

485
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,379
we were not sure what the surprise could
be well we all like it

486
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,119
I ask yes my dad replied every one of
you will love this surprise

487
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:06,150
we heard a noise it was a crying noise
your surprise wants to see you my dad

488
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,160
said he opened the door to the bedroom
and a tiny puppy came running out

489
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,819
we were all very excited our surprise
was a puppy

490
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:18,390
it was a little baby spaniel the puppy
loved all of us

491
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,308
she ran around and let all of our faces
we had always wanted a dog

492
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,940
we take turns feeding the puppy and
taking her out for walks

493
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,420
she is growing quickly and will soon be
an adult dog

494
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,230
we all agree that the puppy was the
nicest surprise my dad could have given

495
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,230
us

496
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,460
rhyming words

497
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,140
sometimes my friends and I play a game
it's something we made up so it doesn't

498
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,220
have a name

499
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,299
we like to take words that rhyme we put
them together line by line

500
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,600
do you get the picture now we're playing
the game and this is how i might say I

501
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,279
like to drive a car

502
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,480
I really don't like to go very far if i
decide to take a walk

503
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,549
I'd go with a friend so that we could
talk do you see that these lines rhyme

504
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,900
play the game

505
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,670
if you have the time we could talk about
school or even playing

506
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,50
do you know what i am saying rhyming
words is easy to do

507
00:39:25,50 --> 00:39:30,960
it's fun for me it can be fun for you
just join in and say something or make

508
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,60
it into a song that you can sing

509
00:39:33,60 --> 00:39:38,460
there are so many words that rhyme with
others like smile and mile and mothers

510
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,600
and brothers

511
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,770
I could spend all day just making up
these things i could let my imagination

512
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:49,950
fly on wings up to the clouds and back
to my mind there are so many rhymes that

513
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:55,439
i can find there are some words that are
hard to find rhymes for I don't use

514
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,970
those words anymore

515
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:03,810
I like to choose words that are easy to
rhyme like cat and bat or lime and time

516
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:09,330
so give it a try I know you'll have fun
I'll say goodbye my rhyming is done

517
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,589
homework

518
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,420
sometimes my teacher gives us homework I
don't mind doing my homework

519
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,859
except when the weather is really nice
and all my friends are outside those

520
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,210
nights I'd rather be outside with them
so I try to get my homework done quickly

521
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,329
tonight i have some english homework

522
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:40,259
we have been reading a book we have to
read a chapter of the book and answer

523
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,390
the questions at the end of the chapter

524
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,960
it is an interesting book so the
homework for this is quite easy

525
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:49,710
my math homework is not so easy

526
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,210
I have to do some addition and
subtraction I don't mind that but there

527
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,289
are some problems that need to be solved
the problems involve addition

528
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,289
subtraction and multiplication

529
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,660
I am not too good with numbers I need to
work harder on my math I just finished a

530
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,460
project for history

531
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,269
I had to make a map of canada with
diagrams showing the roots of all the

532
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:16,439
Explorers it was an interesting project
because i have been to some of the

533
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,599
places that the Explorers went to I
don't have any science homework at

534
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,309
school we are growing bean plants we go
in every day and see how the plants have

535
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,420
grown we write down all the changes that
occur in the plant every day

536
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,930
the only other homework that i have is
geography

537
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,819
I have a map of canada and i have to
write the names of all the provinces and

538
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:40,380
their capitals on it

539
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,89
it won't take me long to do that because
i know all the provinces with my

540
00:41:45,89 --> 00:41:49,410
homework is all done i will go inside
and play ball with my friends until it's

541
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,549
time to come in

542
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:55,229
I am a good student I get good marks
because I like school my favorite

543
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,598
subjects are physical education

544
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,700
english and history math is my least
favorite subject but I'm trying to

545
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,19
improve my marks in that

1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,490
I want to dye my hair green

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,660
many of my friends have dyed their hair
different colors

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,100
I don't mean normal hair colors like
brown or black

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,810
my friends have dyed their hair orange
purple and blue

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,950
I told my mother that I would like to
dye my hair green

6
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,340
I explain to my mother that I would only
use food coloring the green would not

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,989
last forever

8
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,700
my mother said that dying your hair was
a silly fad

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,120
she said that I would not look good with
green hair

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,480
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair
green

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:51,400
maybe I could get a nose ring my mother
said no I said that maybe a tattoo on my

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,660
arm would be nice

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,110
my mother said no way my mother said
that she did some crazy things when she

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,180
was a young girl she said that she used
to iron her hair to make it straight

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,840
that sounds quite boring to me my friend
Joan came over her hair is dyed bright

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,770
pink

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,320
my father said nice hair Joan I don't
think that he really meant it

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,429
my mother says that when I am an adult I
can dye my hair

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,320
whatever crazy color I like but for now
she would like me to leave my hair its

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
natural color

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,60
I tried to tell her that all my friends
were doing it

22
00:01:31,60 --> 00:01:36,549
my mother asked if all your friends were
jumping off a cliff would you do it - I

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,560
said no I think I'll have to wait to
have green hair but maybe by the time

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,80
i'm old enough to dye my hair green

25
00:01:44,80 --> 00:01:48,640
I won't want it that color my mother
says that fads change all the time

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,229
one day something might be popular and
the next day it's not in style at all

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,49
I'll just have to live without green
hair for now I wonder what the Fed will

28
00:01:59,49 --> 00:02:02,49
be next month

29
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,620
why do people dislike other people

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,780
some people don't like other people just
because they look different

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,690
I think that is silly I don't think that
it is fair to judge someone by the way

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,650
they look

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,400
some people look very nice but they are
mean or cruel

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
some people look very ordinary but they
are incredibly nice

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,980
I remember when I was in grade one I saw
a girl across the room she had a mean

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,239
look on her face

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,50
I thought to myself that she was
probably not a very nice person

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,270
I stayed away from her and played with
the other children then we had to play a

39
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,230
game and the teacher said that she would
pick partners for us

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,738
the teacher picked the girl with the
mean face as my partner

41
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,820
I didn't think that the game would be
much fun at all with a partner who

42
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,859
seemed as mean as that girl

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,690
I walked up to her and said hello the
girl's face changed

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,989
she smiled at me and she began to talk
to me

45
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,190
hermine face disappeared we had lots of
fun playing the game

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,900
we laughed a lot and enjoyed each
other's company that girl became my best

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,890
friend

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,40
now when I look at her I see what is
inside her

49
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,530
sometimes she doesn't smile but I know
what she is like she is a kind and funny

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,430
person

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,459
I have learned that you can't judge a
book by it's cover

52
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,739
it is not fair to dislike someone just
because they don't look like you want

53
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,160
them to look you have to get to know a
person

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,79
it doesn't matter to me what color a
person's skin is it doesn't matter to me

55
00:03:56,79 --> 00:04:01,30
if they are short or tall skinny or fat
or happy or sad looking

56
00:04:01,30 --> 00:04:06,310
I judge people by how they treat me and
I try to treat people like I would want

57
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,310
to be treated

58
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,180
the birthday gift

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,930
it is going to be my father's birthday
what can I give him

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,910
I don't have much money i have looked
all through the stores and i have not

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,570
found anything that I think he would
like or that i can afford

62
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,800
I have thought very hard about what to
buy for him

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,810
I thought that he might like some candy
but my father really doesn't eat many

64
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,740
sweets

65
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,910
I thought that he might like a new shirt
but he has lots of clothes

66
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,630
I can't afford a new car or computer for
him

67
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,30
I was watching him on the weekend he cut
the grass wash the car took out the

68
00:04:58,30 --> 00:04:58,809
garbage

69
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,139
we did the garden and water the plants I
got an idea

70
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,550
I went to my room and took out some
paper

71
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,000
I cut out pieces of paper and I wrote on
them

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
I wrote on one piece of paper that i
would wash the car every weekend for the

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,250
summer

74
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,810
I wrote on another piece that I would
take out the garbage every week for the

75
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,710
summer

76
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,900
i also wrote that I would cut the grass
weed the garden and water the plants

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,940
every week for the summer

78
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,550
I made a birthday card for my dad and I
put the pieces of paper inside it

79
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,800
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my
dad my dad thought that the gift was

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
very thoughtful

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,610
he said that it was a gift from the
heart I did all those things for my dad

82
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,510
all summer

83
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,770
he said that he had a lot of free time
because I helped him so much

84
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,780
my dad and I are good friends I don't
mind doing things for him because I know

85
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,270
that he is always there to help me out a
good gift doesn't have to be something

86
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,250
that costs a lot

87
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,320
my dad says that the best gifts are the
ones that show how much you care for the

88
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,430
other person

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,430
I'm glad my dad liked his gift

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,80
New Year's Day

91
00:06:28,80 --> 00:06:31,560
on New Year's Day people start a new
year

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,909
many people make resolutions they
resolved to be better people

93
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,818
some people decide that they will lose
weight so that they can be healthier

94
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,849
some people decide to give up smoking

95
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,310
they also want to be healthier there are
all kinds of resolutions that people

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,629
make some people try not to lose their
tempers

97
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,370
some people say that they will work
harder there are people who try to give

98
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,780
up bad habits

99
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,378
every year my brother says that he will
stop biting his nails

100
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:10,620
he stops biting his nails in January but
my februari he always starts again

101
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,289
that is the thing about New Year's
resolutions people seldom keep them

102
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,940
everybody starts out with good
intentions but it is very hard to stick

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,840
with them

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,219
I don't make new year's resolutions I
find that I just break them

105
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,29
I just work day by day to break my bad
habits

106
00:07:30,29 --> 00:07:34,620
I know that they eat too many sweets
every day I just try to resist them

107
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,279
I think that every day is a new day

108
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,900
regardless of whether it is New Year's
Day or not bad habits are hard to break

109
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,469
the best thing is never to start any bad
habits

110
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,419
I don't know if my brother will ever
stop biting his nails but I know that

111
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,210
each January he intends to stop

112
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,960
maybe one of these new years days he'll
get over that habit

113
00:08:06,60 --> 00:08:09,270
if I could fly

114
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,960
I sometimes imagine what it would be
like if I could fly like a bird

115
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,450
just imagine what it would be like to
soar into the sky flying high above the

116
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,950
trees you could stand on high rooftops
and never be afraid of falling

117
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,719
you would see so many things as you flew
over rooftops and forests you would feel

118
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,190
incredibly free as you traveled from
place to place not bothered by road

119
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,410
signs or traffic jams

120
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,589
if I could fly like a bird I would start
from my backyard and travel through town

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,540
I would look down on the houses and
factories when I got tired i would land

122
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,819
in a field and take a nap

123
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,410
I would travel above rivers and follow
them as they wound along and emptied

124
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,209
into lakes and oceans

125
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,920
I would fly above parks and i would call
out to the children as I flew high above

126
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,910
them

127
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,880
I would dip and dive as I flew I would
soar up high and dive down low so that I

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,910
could almost touch the tree tops

129
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,709
have you ever flown I know that you
can't fly like a bird but you might have

130
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,990
taken an airplane ride when you're in an
airplane you pass through clouds

131
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,60
it is exciting to take an airplane ride
I love taking airplane flights

132
00:09:24,60 --> 00:09:27,810
I like to look down at the earth when
you're up that high

133
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,489
everything below you looks tiny that's
the closest i'll get to flying like a

134
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,980
bird but i can still use my imagination
and spread my wings and soar high above

135
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,980
the world just like a bird

136
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,570
what I look for in a friend

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,850
what is it that makes somebody your
friend some people are nice and you have

138
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,900
fun with them

139
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,579
some people are nice to talk to but they
don't become special to you

140
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,800
some people become very close to you
those people are the ones who become

141
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,780
your good friends

142
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,939
did you ever wonder why certain people
do become your good friends friends

143
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,130
usually have something in common

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,850
often friends enjoy doing the same
things as each other

145
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,800
maybe they like the same sports or the
same music or maybe they can even talk

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,170
about problems or schoolwork friends
usually find a common bond

147
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,969
friends share ideas and listen to each
other sometimes people who don't have

148
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,790
similar interests even become friends

149
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,839
you can learn a lot from a person who
likes different things than you

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,740
the most important thing about friends
is that they must communicate with each

151
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,520
other

152
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,800
a good friend is a person who takes the
time to listen to the other person one

153
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,790
of the most important things that i
think a friend should have is a sense of

154
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,819
humor I like to laugh with my friends

155
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,530
I like to feel comfortable around my
friends it is nice to be able to talk

156
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,560
and laugh with people who have similar
interests

157
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,790
it is nice to share things with people
and learn about their interests you

158
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,810
become a better person if you are able
to learn things from others

159
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,810
life is a journey on that journey you
meet many people some of those people

160
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,589
will change your life you have to choose
your friends with care

161
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,670
a good friend is worth more than all the
gold in the world

162
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,310
a good friend will make your journey
through life more pleasant make friends

163
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,550
along the way and the path through life
will be very rewarding

164
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
a funny thing happened on the way to
school

165
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,280
last Friday it was very windy I was
walking down the street with my friend

166
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,380
John we were having a difficult time
walking against the wind the wind was

167
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,490
pushing against us and we felt the force
of it pressing against us

168
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,640
we even had a hard time breathing we
were walking slowly we watch the leaves

169
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,40
as they danced and twirled in the wind

170
00:12:16,40 --> 00:12:21,260
we watched a plastic bag as it flew by
us we saw a little boy whose baseball

171
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,600
cap flew right off his head his cap flew
along the sidewalk and he had to chase

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,260
it

173
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,460
he finally caught it and he held it in
his hands tightly after he got it back

174
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,460
the trees were swaying frantically their
branches swished and waved in the wild

175
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,270
wind

176
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,829
John and I were hit by flying bits of
paper and leaves

177
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,660
we laughed when a garbage can lid rolled
along and hit John in the leg

178
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,699
we saw another garbage can rolling along
the road as if it was alive

179
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,219
everything was moving because of the
wind then the funniest thing happened

180
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,770
I wasn't paying any attention and a
paper bag came flying up the street

181
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,000
toward us

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,780
it hit me right in the face and covered
my whole face

183
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,70
at first I didn't know what had happened
I was blinded

184
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,650
I couldn't see where I was going I
stopped and held out my hands when I

185
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,439
stopped the bag fell off my face

186
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I looked at John he was laughing very
hard

187
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,910
he was laughing so hard that tears were
rolling down his cheeks

188
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,69
he said that I looked very funny with
the brown paper bag stuck to my face

189
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,449
I started to laugh - we laughed about it
all the way to school

190
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,199
John said that he wished he had a camera

191
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,410
he would have taken a picture of me with
a bag on my face

192
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,579
advice

193
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
sometimes my mother gives me advice

194
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,820
she tells me to save my money for a
rainy day

195
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,410
she says that I should eat my vegetables
if I want to be strong when I grow up

196
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,20
she says that you reap what you sow I
didn't know what that one meant so i

197
00:14:16,20 --> 00:14:21,660
asked her she said that if you are good
to people they will be good to you if

198
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,930
you do bad things and bad things will
come back to you

199
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,420
my mother is always giving me advice she
says that a penny saved is a penny

200
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,410
earned

201
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,490
I am still thinking about that one some
of these things are difficult to

202
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,610
understand my mother is very wise

203
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
she says that she has learned from her
mistakes

204
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,740
she tells me that she would like me not
to make mistakes but she says that

205
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,170
everyone does make mistakes

206
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,170
the important thing is that we learn
from our mistakes

207
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,980
my mother says that nobody is perfect

208
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,980
my mother tells my sister that time is
precious

209
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,210
my sister wastes time and my mother
doesn't like that

210
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,450
my mother tells me to be true to myself

211
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,600
she says that I should not follow the
crowd

212
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,140
I should listen to my own conscience and
do what I think is right

213
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,880
she says that it doesn't matter if you
fail at something the important thing is

214
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,870
that you try if you've done your best
then that is all that matters

215
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,489
I listened to my mother I think she
gives very good advice

216
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,580
my mother has a lot of common sense i
hope i am as wise as she is

217
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,560
when I have children of my own sometimes
I wish that she would not give me so

218
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,729
much advice

219
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,500
I think that I know what I'm doing but
in the end i always remember what she

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,420
has said and I try to live by the
standards that she has set for me take

221
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,490
the advice that your parents give you

222
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,490
they only have your best interests at
heart

223
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,950
a trip to the hospital

224
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,750
I have to get my tonsils out I'm not
really happy about it but I'm tired of

225
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,270
being sick and having sore throats

226
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,890
I have to go to the hospital two hours
before my surgery my mother will go with

227
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,640
me

228
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
the nurses will take my temperature and
check my blood pressure

229
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,270
they will make sure that i am ready for
my operation

230
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,430
I will be dressed in a white gown and i
will be wheeled down the hall to the

231
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,750
operating room

232
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,880
I can't have anything to eat or drink
for a long time before my surgery my

233
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,530
mother will walk down the hall with me
then she will wave goodbye as they will

234
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,850
me into the operating room the doctor
and the nurses will be busy in the

235
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,930
operating room

236
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,239
they will be getting ready to perform my
surgery the doctor will say hello to me

237
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,570
and tell me that he is going to put me
to sleep

238
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,310
he will put something into my arm he
will tell me to count backwards from ten

239
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,109
I think that I will only say ten nine
and then i will be fast asleep

240
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,79
I won't be awake for the surgery when I
wake up I will be surprised that the

241
00:17:14,79 --> 00:17:18,369
surgery is over my throat will hurt and
i probably won't feel very good

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,79
my mother will be there with me the
nurses will give me a drink and try to

243
00:17:23,79 --> 00:17:24,430
make me comfortable

244
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,100
I won't be in the hospital overnight I
will go home later in the day my parents

245
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,129
will have to make sure that i have a lot
to drink

246
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,580
I can't eat any hard foods or they will
hurt my throat

247
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,600
I will sleep a lot because I will not
feel very well for a couple of days

248
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,260
it won't take long before I recover from
my surgery

249
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,60
sometimes we need surgery to make us
feel better hospitals can be a bit

250
00:17:49,60 --> 00:17:53,770
frightening but the doctors and nurses
are very nice and their job is to make

251
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,770
you better

252
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,658
what my cat did

253
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,19
one day I was sitting in a chair
drinking a cup of tea

254
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:21,840
my cat came into the room and sat on my
lap she was quite content and she SAT

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,299
there purring my cat likes to drink
water and sometimes she drinks milk

256
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,158
I would never give her tea to drink cats
just don't drink tea

257
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,919
we were sitting there quietly when
suddenly my cat stood up she was looking

258
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,749
at something on the floor

259
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:43,200
she crouched down low and got ready to
pounce

260
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,39
I saw what she was looking at it was a
huge centipede

261
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:52,919
I think that centipedes are ugly they
have many legs and they move very fast

262
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,129
I would hate to have one crawl over me
my cat jump to the floor and she ran

263
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,689
over to the centipede

264
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,609
she was incredibly fast I was surprised
that she caught the centipede

265
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:11,369
she put her paw on it and then she
reached down and ate the centipede the

266
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:14,428
centipede must not have tasted very good

267
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,299
my cat got a funny look on her face and
she looked like she was trying to get a

268
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,668
bad taste out of her mouth

269
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:26,340
I was thinking that I would be sick if I
ate a centipede my cat looked at B and

270
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,289
jump back up in my chair

271
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,99
she stuck her face in my teacup and took
a big drink of tea

272
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,570
I was shocked i had never seen a cat
drink tea before I think that the

273
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,249
centipede must have tasted so bad that
my cat just needed something to wash the

274
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,320
taste out of her mouth

275
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,830
guess what I didn't finish my tea

276
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,949
I threw it out and washed out the cup my
cat has never had a drink of tea since

277
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,559
that day she has also never eaten
another centipede if a centipede walks

278
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,590
by she just pretends that she doesn't
see it

279
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,300
if I was tiny

280
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,780
imagine what life would be like if you
were two inches tall

281
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,760
you would have to be careful that nobody
stepped on you you would have to watch

282
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,610
out for cats dogs and birds

283
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,570
it would be very dangerous but just
think of the things that you could do

284
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,810
you could live in a dollhouse or even a
shoebox

285
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
you could use a bottle cap for a plate

286
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,600
you would have to wear dolls clothes a
stamp would make a lovely picture to

287
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
hang on your wall

288
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
you could hide in a Mousehole or a
drawer

289
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,330
you wouldn't need much food you could
probably live comfortably on the crumbs

290
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,30
that people would leave on the table a
thimble would make a good cup if you

291
00:21:06,30 --> 00:21:10,350
went outside the grass would seem like a
jungle an insect would be huge and

292
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,980
frightening a puddle would seem to be an
ocean

293
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,710
you could cross the puddle in a paper
cup and use a spoon for or a matchbox

294
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,120
would make a good bed with a
handkerchief as a bedspread you brush

295
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,840
your hair with a toothbrush but you'd
never find anything small enough to

296
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,340
brush your teeth with you could take a
ride on the back of a mouse

297
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,510
you wouldn't find any books that were
small enough to read but you might read

298
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,310
the back of a pill bottle

299
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:44,250
you could ride in a toy car and have a
super ball for a swimming pool a leaf

300
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,960
could be your umbrella and a mitten
would make a great sleeping bag if you

301
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,340
use your imagination

302
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,550
you could think of something to use for
almost all your purposes

303
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,840
being small might be fun but then again
it would be frightening

304
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,520
I'd be afraid of my pet cat I wouldn't
want a book to fall on me I would be

305
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,879
afraid of being swept away by a big gust
of wind

306
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I think I'd rather be my size

307
00:22:19,10 --> 00:22:22,10
do people have the right to smoke in
public

308
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,330
my father used to small

309
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,330
he got very ill

310
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,350
the doctor told him that he had to quit
smoking

311
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,760
my father tried for a long time to quit

312
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,730
it was very difficult for him smoking is
an addiction

313
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,840
after many months

314
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,300
my father finally gave up smoking but he
still craved a cigarette once in a while

315
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,460
he says that quitting smoking is the
hardest thing that he has ever done

316
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,629
when my father did smoke he smoked
everywhere

317
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,510
he smoked in restaurants stores and many
public buildings

318
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,820
now you are not allowed to smoke in a
lot of public places

319
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:22,730
when my father smoked the rules were not
so strict people could smoke just about

320
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,900
anywhere

321
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:31,309
it really wasn't fair to the people who
didn't smoke their clothes always

322
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,580
smelled like smoke and they breathe in
secondhand smoke some people think that

323
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,970
the second hand smoke is actually worse
for you than if you smoke yourself

324
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,280
people with smoke in their houses and
very young children would inhale the

325
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,260
smoke that was in the air

326
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,120
some people still smoke in their houses
and their children breathe in the smoke

327
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,70
some restaurants have areas for smokers
and non-smokers

328
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,149
but usually the smoke drifts from one
area to the other

329
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,590
there are some businesses that have been
smoking altogether

330
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,789
personally I think that smoking in
public places should be completely

331
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,919
banned

332
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,940
I don't think that I should have to
breathe in another person smoke if I

333
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,970
choose not to smoke myself it wouldn't
be fair for a nonsmoker to get lung

334
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,169
cancer because they had to be in a place
where smokers were allowed to light up

335
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,620
I know that smoking is a powerful
addiction and that it is very difficult

336
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,178
to quit but smokers should restrict
their smoking to places where there is

337
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,570
nobody else around

338
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,570
lung cancer is an awful disease

339
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,320
nobody should have to suffer with monk
answer people should be educated about

340
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,460
the dangers of smoking smoking should be
banned in public places but eventually I

341
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,519
would like to believe that fewer people
will smoke it would be nice to live in a

342
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,519
smoke-free environment

343
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,169
if I were a giant

344
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,909
if I were a giant I wouldn't be able to
fit in my house I'd have to live in a

345
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,749
building that had a high ceiling but i
probably have a hard time getting

346
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,859
through the door

347
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,789
I'd have to make my own clothes but
where would I get a giant needle and

348
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:45,59
thread to sew with I couldn't ride in a
car or a plane

349
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,499
I suppose I would just have to take
giant steps to get from place to place

350
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,238
I would have to be very careful not to
step on anybody or anything

351
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,840
when I talked people would cover their
ears my voice would sound very loud to

352
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,408
them I wouldn't find the shoes to cover
my feet

353
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,909
I wouldn't find a knife and fork to eat
my dinner with I might have to use a

354
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,499
rake as a fork

355
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:14,39
my dinner would be huge what would I
cook my dinner in

356
00:26:14,39 --> 00:26:19,289
I certainly wouldn't find an oven big
enough to put my dinner and if I sneezed

357
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,90
it would be like a hurricane

358
00:26:21,90 --> 00:26:24,418
if I fell down it would be like an
earthquake

359
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,230
I wouldn't have any friends because
everyone would be too tiny for me to

360
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,159
talk to

361
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,279
I think that being a giant would be very
lonely

362
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,749
I couldn't have just one Apple I would
have to have a lot of apples to fill me

363
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:37,379
up

364
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:40,379
I would have to drink gallons and
gallons of water to quench my thirst

365
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,359
I could never relax under a tree I would
be taller than all the trees

366
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,418
I don't think that being a giant would
be fun

367
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,100
I won't ever make a wish to be a giant i
would rather be my height

368
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm very happy the way I am yeah

369
00:27:06,60 --> 00:27:09,60
superstitions

370
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,270
I am NOT superstitious are you yesterday
was Friday the 13th

371
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:25,330
some people think that friday the 13 is
an unlucky day I think that it is just

372
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,679
like any other day

373
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,980
some people believe that if a black cat
crosses your path you will have bad luck

374
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,630
I don't believe that either

375
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,560
my mother always gets upset if i open an
umbrella in the house

376
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,790
she says that is bad luck she is
probably right about that one because an

377
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,780
open umbrella would take up a lot of
space and you might not things over

378
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,940
if your left hand is itchy you are
supposed to get money i have had an

379
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,110
energy left hand before but I haven't
received any money because of it

380
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:13,100
it is bad like to walk under a ladder
that is probably true because you might

381
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,639
knock somebody off the ladder or have a
can of paint fall on top of you

382
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,470
if you are acting in a play it is bad
luck if someone says good luck to you

383
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,330
this is very confusing you were supposed
to tell an actor to break a leg

384
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
it doesn't mean that you want the actor
to break his leg

385
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,310
it means good luck to the actor actors
have a lot of superstitions that are

386
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,550
very unusual

387
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:50,639
I am NOT superstitious I don't believe
in superstitions at all

388
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,690
it is just fun to learn about
superstitions

389
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,420
some of them are very old and have been
passed down from generation to

390
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,550
generation

391
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,669
I once did a project at school on
superstitions

392
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,200
it was a very interesting topic and they
got a good mark for it

393
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
my favorite bedtime story

394
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,559
every night when I was little my mother
would read me a bedtime story

395
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,270
my favorite story was Tom's midnight
garden

396
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,970
this was a story by Filipa pierce it was
quite a long book and it took quite a

397
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:51,230
few nights for my mother to read the
entire book to me in Toms midnight

398
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,920
garden

399
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,460
Tom moves to the city to stay with his
aunt and uncle he is very bored at their

400
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,570
apartment

401
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,919
they have no children so tom has nothing
to do

402
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,800
one night the clock strikes 13 times

403
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
tom knows that this is impossible

404
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,940
a clock can only strike up to 12 times
he sneaks downstairs and goes outside

405
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,119
when he goes outside there is a
wonderful garden

406
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,119
that wasn't there the day before

407
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:35,480
the next day Tom goes outside and finds
there is no garden the garden only seems

408
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,929
to appear at night every night

409
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:43,190
Tom slips out to this wonderful garden
and meet some people in the garden

410
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:51,110
he meets a girl named caddy happy and
Tom become very good friends in this

411
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,110
garden

412
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,370
some very strange things happen in this
book

413
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,10
there are some coincidences that keep
you guessing about what is really going

414
00:31:03,10 --> 00:31:06,520
on the surprise ending is wonderful

415
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,910
I really enjoyed Tom's midnight garden
and I was very sad when my mother and I

416
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,830
came to the end of the book

417
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,490
I felt that I had visited the magical
garden with tom

418
00:31:19,30 --> 00:31:22,30
it is a book that i will remember all my
life

419
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
if I found a magic lamp

420
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,270
if I was walking down the beach one day
and I happened to bump my toe on a magic

421
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,990
lamp

422
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:50,409
I would pick it up and rub it if it was
a real magic lamp

423
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,880
but i don't believe that there really is
a magic lamp a genie would pop out in a

424
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
cloud of smoke and he would call me
master

425
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,230
he would say that he would grant me
three wishes

426
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:08,379
I would have to think very hard about
those wishes because I wouldn't want to

427
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,490
waste them

428
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,659
I don't think I'd want millions of
dollars

429
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:18,70
money doesn't buy happiness or so they
say

430
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,760
I might wish for good health

431
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,899
because if your health isn't good you
won't be able to enjoy anything

432
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,929
some people might wish for beauty but
beauty is only skin deep

433
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,959
some people would wish for a mansion or
a beautiful car or a big boat

434
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,580
I don't want any of those things some
people would want Fame

435
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,419
some people would want talent

436
00:32:51,80 --> 00:32:58,340
some people would wish for happiness
that might be a good thing to wish for

437
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,000
yes maybe I'd wish for health and
happiness

438
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,690
but what would my third wish be I could
wish for something enormous something

439
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,200
global I could wish for world peace

440
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,270
that would be a wonderful thing if
somebody could grant me that

441
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,650
yes that would probably be my third wish

442
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,960
it's too bad there aren't any genies
inside magic lamps

443
00:33:28,10 --> 00:33:31,160
I won't get my three wishes

444
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,120
I can still work toward getting my
wishes

445
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,830
I can eat well and exercise to stay
healthy

446
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,949
I can be involved with a lot of things
and be with my friends to stay happy

447
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,860
I can volunteer my time two different
organizations to help achieve world

448
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,260
peace

449
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,379
I can do my fair share in my community
to help others

450
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,409
that's how i can get my three wishes not
through a magic lamp

451
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,610
I can only get what I want through self
determination and hard work that is the

452
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,610
key to getting your wishes fulfilled

453
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:25,418
help

454
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,859
did you ever have to call for help

455
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,859
were you ever in a situation that was an
emergency

456
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,509
it is good to know what to do in case of
an emergency

457
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:42,488
you should always know how to get in
touch with the police and fire

458
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,629
departments

459
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,538
i have read stories were very young boys
or girls have called the police and

460
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,829
saved their friends or family members
lives because they knew just who to get

461
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,260
a hold of

462
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,380
if you see a fire you should call the
fire department

463
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,410
a lot of tragedies have been prevented
because the calls have been made quickly

464
00:35:08,30 --> 00:35:11,570
it is important than emergency vehicles
arrived very quickly

465
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:20,150
that is why those vehicles have sirens
when their sirens go

466
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,480
it means to get out of the way

467
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,490
policemen firemen and ambulance
attendants are trained to handle very

468
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:36,770
difficult situations they often save
people's lives they go through a lot of

469
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,290
training to become good at what they do

470
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,380
they never panic in emergencies

471
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,29
for your part you should keep emergency
numbers near the phone or know what the

472
00:35:49,30 --> 00:35:51,470
emergency numbers are

473
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,490
where I live there is a special number
that you call for any emergency

474
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,950
we teach that number to everyone even
very tiny children

475
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,299
it is important to remain calm if you
need help

476
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,410
if you call an emergency number

477
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,700
you have to be able to speak clearly and
tell the person you are talking to

478
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,950
exactly what the problem is

479
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,868
I hope you are never in an emergency
situation but it is a good idea to be

480
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,869
prepared

481
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,149
the peach orchard

482
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,50
when I was very young I lived in erie
peach orchard

483
00:36:43,50 --> 00:36:46,980
now there is a park where the orchard
used to be

484
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,70
I always remember the peach orchard
because my grandmother and I used to go

485
00:36:53,70 --> 00:36:56,310
there and pick peaches

486
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,310
the owner of the orchard would let all
the neighbors pick peaches

487
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,730
it's not the fact that I used to get
many ripe tasty peaches that I remember

488
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,650
it's the time that I used to spend with
my grandmother that I remember my

489
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,770
grandmother was very old but she was
very healthy

490
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,970
she used to walk a lot i think that is
what kept her fit

491
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,750
she had a lot of energy so she like to
go to a lot of places

492
00:37:27,30 --> 00:37:31,470
she would get a fruit basket and then
she would ask me if I wanted to go to

493
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,399
the orchard

494
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,650
I always said yes because I enjoyed
walking through the orchard on a sunny

495
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,340
day

496
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,240
we never climbed up on a ladder to reach
the peaches

497
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,490
we just reached for the low hanging
fruit my grandmother and I used to talk

498
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,439
all the time that we were out there

499
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,910
it was nice to spend time with her

500
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,390
she told me many stories about when she
was a young girl

501
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,390
we laughed and got to know each other
better

502
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
my grandmother only visited us during
the summer

503
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,370
she lived in california and i lived in
Niagara Falls

504
00:38:08,60 --> 00:38:11,60
so we didn't get to spend a lot of time
with each other

505
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,900
we enjoyed the hot summer days in the
orchard

506
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,689
you could smell the peaches and the bees
buzz lazily bias

507
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,210
my grandmother would point out different
insects and birds to me

508
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,210
I learned a lot about nature from her

509
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,430
we would end up with a big basket of
peaches

510
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,609
when we got home my mother would wash
the peaches and often she would bake a

511
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,770
peach pie for us

512
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,750
nobody bakes the peach pie like my
mother it's good to have memories like

513
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:53,660
that childhood memories of time spent
with my grandmother are very precious to

514
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:00,259
me sometimes is just the simple things
that you do in life that leave you with

515
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
the nicest memories

516
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,379
learning to dance

517
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,539
I went to England with my mother she
used to be a singer in a band

518
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:33,269
we went to the hotel that she used to
sing at it was a big fancy hotel

519
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:38,98
some of the people that she knew when
she saying in the band were still there

520
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:44,430
they remembered my mother and they had a
good time talking to her and remembering

521
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,690
old times

522
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,799
many people told me that I looked like
my mother

523
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,480
in the hotel they had a fancy hall where
they had ballroom dancing

524
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,20
i am not used to that kind of dancing

525
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,620
I always danced to rock music

526
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,780
a man told me that he would teach me how
to dance

527
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:16,520
it looked very easy i held one of his
hands and put my other hand on his

528
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,740
shoulder

529
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,740
he told me exactly how to move my feet

530
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I was very clumsy and I stepped on his
toes

531
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,90
he was patient with me and he counted
one two three

532
00:40:32,90 --> 00:40:40,70
I tried to waltz with him i would start
out pretty well but then i would get

533
00:40:40,70 --> 00:40:42,680
mixed up and stand on his toes again

534
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,390
the man laughed about it I told him that
I wasn't a very good dancer but he said

535
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,220
that I was good for a beginner

536
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,368
I think he was just being polite

537
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,170
the man asked my mother to dance my
mother is a very good dancer

538
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,160
I didn't know that about her

539
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,330
she never stepped on the man's toes once
the man thanks for Dancing with him and

540
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,330
I thank him for giving me dancing
lessons

541
00:41:18,70 --> 00:41:21,280
I don't think i'll ever be very good at
that type of dancing

542
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,480
each generation has a specific type of
dancing

543
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:32,830
the way that I dance is different from
the way that my mother dances the way

544
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,40
that I dance doesn't involve moving your
feet too much

545
00:41:36,40 --> 00:41:39,40
I'm not too good at fancy steps

546
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,590
superheroes

547
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,750
when my brother was very young he loved
superheroes

548
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,269
he could

549
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:06,269
the plastic figures of all the
superheroes

550
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:14,39
I think he had every superhero figurine
that there was he used to tie a towel

551
00:42:14,39 --> 00:42:16,709
over his shoulders and run through the
backyard

552
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:20,98
he pretended that he was rescuing people

553
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:27,179
one time he stood on the roof he really
thought that he could fly with this

554
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,829
superhero cape on

555
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:35,249
he would have hurt himself if he had
jumped my dad saw him and told him to

556
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:39,299
get down my dad explained to my brother

557
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:44,999
the superheroes are not real real people
cannot fly from rooftops

558
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:51,989
my brother was disappointed he thought
that the superheroes really existed

559
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,950
my dad explained that most superheroes
were created as comic book characters

560
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,649
somebody used their imagination to make
them up and then an artist through them

561
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:10,249
my brother was not impressed he said
that he wanted to meet the superheroes

562
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,339
my father told him that he might meet
someone dressed up as a superhero but it

563
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,69
wouldn't really be a superhero in the
classroom

564
00:43:19,69 --> 00:43:23,269
it is hard to explain two small children
that the things that they see in comic

565
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,269
books and on television aren't really
real

566
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,799
my brothers still pretty

567
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,500
he is a superhero he doesn't jump from
rooftops but he runs around and makes

568
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,230
noises like he is flying

569
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,290
I look at him and remember when I used
to do things like that

570
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,649
I'm more mature than my brother I know
that superheroes aren't real but I know

571
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,50
that he is having fun and using his
imagination

1
00:00:03,80 --> 00:00:08,870
being a princess sometimes i think that
i would like to be a princess a Princess

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,790
would live in a palace and wear
beautiful clothes she would have

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,640
servants to do chores for her and she
would probably marry a handsome prince

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,910
people would recognize her they would
wave to her as she drove by it seems

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,130
like it would be a lot of fun to be a
princess but maybe it wouldn't be so

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,750
nice

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,809
maybe it would be terrible to be
recognized by everyone

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,199
maybe a princess would feel like
everyone was watching her she would have

9
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:42,979
to look nice

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,330
every time she left the palace there
would always be people with cameras who

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,119
wanted to take her picture a princess
would have no privacy even in her own

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,839
palace

13
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:59,330
there would be servants around so she
would never really be alone if I were a

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,260
princess

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,260
I would worry about security for my
family

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,780
sometimes people who are in high
positions are threatened by other people

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,990
that would be a worry I'm not so sure
that being a princess would be all that

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,979
much fun

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,610
I think it might be better to be just a
normal person like me

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,990
I don't have to worry about looking
wonderful all the time

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,820
people don't follow me around and take
my picture whenever you see a picture of

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,679
a princess she is smiling

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,540
I wonder if she's smiling on the inside
or just smiling for the camera

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,810
my worst fear I am afraid of water

25
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't know why i am afraid i have
never had a bad experience in the water

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,600
I just never learned to swim I should
have done that when I was just little it

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,789
would be easier for me to swim now if i
had started when i was young i will go

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,990
into the shallow water but I start to
panic when the water gets higher than my

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,980
chest

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,880
I don't like the feeling of not being
able to put my feet on the bottom of the

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
pool or the lake

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I don't like to get water up my nose I
choke and cough when that happens my

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,120
friends just tell me to relax and i will
float but i find it hard to relax in

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,170
deep water

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,570
they keep telling me that if I panic i
will think most of my friends have had

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,829
swimming lessons

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,440
some of them are even lifeguards they
have tried to teach me to swim but I

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
think I need to go to a place where they
actually teach swimming

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,000
it would be nice to jump into a pool of
cold water on a hot summer day

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,709
that would be so refreshing if I go out
onto a boat

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,130
I always wear a life jacket I think it
is wise to do that everyone should wear

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
a life jacket on a boat

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:08,830
I would rather be safe than sorry I have
decided that I will overcome my fear I

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,750
will go and take swimming lessons

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,110
I have a goal by this time next year

46
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,950
I would like to be able to swim the
length of the pool without being afraid

47
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,30
it is best to face your fears and deal
with them

48
00:03:22,30 --> 00:03:25,30
I hope that I can overcome my fear of
water

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,420
if I live to be 100 i think i would like
to live to be 100

50
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,819
it seems like an awfully long time to
live it is an entire century

51
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,290
imagine all the changes that you would
see if you live to be 100

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,260
I had a neighbor who was 85 she used to
tell me what things were like when she

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,880
was a little girl she told me what my
town used to look like what her clothes

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,280
were like and what her school was like I
used to enjoy listening to her stories

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,370
everything was so different when she was
young

56
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,370
listening to her was like having history
come to life

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,250
I used to try to imagine what life was
like for her back then if I was a

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
hundred and I had grandchildren and
great-grandchildren

59
00:04:21,29 --> 00:04:26,10
I would tell them stories about my
childhood I would hope that I had a good

60
00:04:26,10 --> 00:04:28,860
memory so that I could remember
everything

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
if i do want to live to 100

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,510
I'll have to have a healthy lifestyle
not too many people live to be that old

63
00:04:37,20 --> 00:04:42,570
if I do get to be that old I hope I'll
still be mentally alert and physically

64
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,390
agile in my country

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,650
the Prime Minister sends a letter of
congratulations to anyone who has their

66
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,969
hundredth birthday

67
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,970
people who live to be 100 are very
special

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,330
maybe in the future with better medical
care and healthier lifestyles more

69
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,680
people will live to be 100 if I live to
be 100 all have a birthday cake but I

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,140
won't put 100 candles on the cake

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I could never blow out 100 candles

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,490
what I like most and least about myself
I was trying to think of the best and

73
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,530
the worst things about myself

74
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,888
I think the best thing about me is that
i am very friendly

75
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,69
I have a lot of friends and they all
like me

76
00:05:38,69 --> 00:05:43,229
I try to be good to my friends I don't
often have arguments with people i think

77
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,210
that i am quite easy to get along with
the worst thing about me is that I

78
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,940
sometimes feel sad sometimes I don't
feel sad for any particular reason I

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,909
just get into moods where I am depressed
sometimes there is a reason to be sad I

80
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:05,940
was sad when my pet frog died I was sad
when I lost my favorite baseball card on

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,750
those days

82
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,979
I'm still nice to my friends but inside
I feel like there is a heavyweight in my

83
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,909
chest

84
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,949
I think that everyone feel sadness
sometimes I try to do things that make

85
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:17,819
me happy

86
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,250
whenever I get into one of my sad moods
last Saturday I felt a bit sad so I

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,550
called up my friend John and asked him
if he wanted to go to the movies

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,860
we went to a comedy we laughed all the
way through the movie so that by the

89
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,190
time the movie was over I didn't feel
sad anymore

90
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,610
my friendliness is my best trait and my
sad moods are my worst traits i have to

91
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,979
work at getting over my sad moves more
quickly being sad doesn't do anyone any

92
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:47,849
good

93
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,849
there is no use and feeling sorry for
oneself

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,740
the trunk in the Attic last month my
grandmother asked me if I could help her

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,120
to clean out her attic

96
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,860
I was happy that she asked me my
grandmother says that our attic is full

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,60
of junk

98
00:07:14,60 --> 00:07:18,530
I think that our attic is full of
treasures I helped her to dust and

99
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,849
vacuum the Attic

100
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,60
I pulled and pushed around boxes and
crates

101
00:07:23,60 --> 00:07:26,210
I helped her to wash the floors and
walls

102
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,919
my favorite thing that I did was to sort
through the old trunk that she had up

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,790
there

104
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,320
the trunk had a rusty latch on it it was
a bit difficult to open

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,260
but my grandmother got a knife and pride
the latch open the trunk was full of all

106
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,670
kinds of things

107
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,800
there are lots of clothes some of the
clothes had been my grandmother's there

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,220
was a blue velvet dress that she had
worn to a dance when she and my

109
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,720
grandfather were dating

110
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,560
it was a beautiful dress but there were
a few more holes in it

111
00:07:58,70 --> 00:08:02,480
there were some of my mother's old
clothes there was a pair of bell-bottom

112
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,730
slacks that had bright flowers on it

113
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,780
I couldn't believe that my mother had
ever worn something like that

114
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,840
there were some of my mother's old
report cards

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,000
some of her marks weren't very good I
had fun reading the report cards

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,830
there were photographs there was a
picture of my grandparents holding my

117
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,570
mother when she was a baby

118
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,409
there was an old baseball glove that one
of my uncle's had owned

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,390
there was even one of my old dolls in
there one of her legs was missing my

120
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,679
grandmother said that I was rough on my
dolls when i was little i should have

121
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,719
taken better care of my toys

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,910
there was even some old jewelry I tried
on some of the old clothes and jewelry

123
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,930
I told my grandmother that I like
looking through old things

124
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,140
my grandmother told me to keep whatever
I wanted

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,950
she said that it was all junk I still
say that her trunk was full of treasures

126
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,199
hot and cold I noticed that whenever it
is summer people complain about the heat

127
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,99
but whenever it is winter people
complain about the cold

128
00:09:19,29 --> 00:09:22,29
it seems that people are never satisfied

129
00:09:23,50 --> 00:09:28,839
I don't like the winter it is usually
much too cold for me my teeth chatter

130
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,300
and my fingers turn them whenever the
weather gets cold it is hard for me to

131
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,339
warm up once i start to freeze

132
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,470
I try to wear layers of clothes but
winter winds go through my clothes

133
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,480
no matter how much i wear my feet feel
like they are blocks of ice on a cold

134
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,850
January day when I walk home from school
I would not like to live in a place that

135
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,130
had cold climate all year long

136
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,189
I am not comfortable when it is too cold

137
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,949
I like the summer some people say that
it is hot and sticky in the summer but I

138
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,810
don't mind the heat at all

139
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,529
I love to feel the warm sunshine on my
skin

140
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,790
I like the freedom of not having to wear
heavy coats and boots

141
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,50
I am the happiest when there is a
slightly cool breeze that comes along to

142
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:19,389
refresh you on a hot summer day

143
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,870
I could live in a place with a hot
climate I would enjoy that

144
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:28,540
of course when you are in a place with a
hot climate there are more bugs than in

145
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,370
places with cooler climates

146
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,670
I don't care for bugs where I live

147
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,750
it is very humid the heat and moisture
combined to make it uncomfortable

148
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,260
sometimes it is nicer when the heat is
high but the humidity is low it would be

149
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,100
better if I live somewhere where it was
hot but not humid

150
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
that would be just perfect

151
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,630
walk a mile in my shoes have you ever
heard the saying walk a mile in my shoes

152
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,569
I think it's a very good thing do you
know what it means it means that before

153
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,490
you judge someone you should put
yourself in his or her position for

154
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,530
example if someone was running in a race
and they did very poorly and came in

155
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,430
last

156
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,849
it wouldn't be fair to say oh he's just
a terrible runner

157
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,750
you would have to look at all the
circumstances that made the person lose

158
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,590
the race

159
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,590
maybe they pulled a muscle in their leg
the day before

160
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,290
maybe this is their very first race
maybe they are not in good form because

161
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,910
something isn't right in their lives
there can be so many things that affect

162
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,610
a person's life performance and moods

163
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,550
there can be so many things that affect
a person's life performance and moods

164
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,870
if someone was very quiet at a party you
couldn't just assume that they weren't

165
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,920
friendly

166
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,689
you don't know what is happening in
their lives they could be feeling ill or

167
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,60
they might have just had a bad
experience

168
00:12:07,60 --> 00:12:12,819
nobody can know exactly how another
person feels even if someone tells you

169
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,620
what he or she is experiencing you still
won't fully understand what is going on

170
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,50
inside the other person everyone
perceives and feels things differently

171
00:12:23,50 --> 00:12:28,479
to walk a mile in someone else's shoes
is to try and understand things from

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,310
that person's perspective we are all
shaped by the events that have taken

173
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,229
place in our lives

174
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,890
no two people have gone through the
exact same things

175
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,990
so before you are quick to judge someone
stop and think about what it is that

176
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,790
they might have gone through

177
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,260
you won't always understand why people
do what they do but you can try to

178
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,260
understand and put yourself in their
position

179
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,710
if I could go back in my life if I could
go back in my life and do some things

180
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,640
differently

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,140
this is what i would do I would not
waste so many hours in front of the

182
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,790
television set

183
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:23,459
I would get out and enjoy my life rather
than watching actors and shows i would

184
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,370
be a little more considerate of other
people

185
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,440
I would realize that my mother has more
to do and pick up after me i would pay

186
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,460
more attention in school tests are
easier when you have paid attention

187
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,650
rather than fooling around in class I
would save more money rather than spend

188
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,380
it on useless things i would read more
reading is enjoyable and it opens the

189
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,320
doors into all kinds of wonderful places
both real and imagined I would learn to

190
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,410
play an instrument music is always
appreciated if it is played well I would

191
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,640
eat better foods

192
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,300
I would try to stay healthy through my
diet and exercise

193
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I would take more pictures and I would
keep a journal

194
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,420
memories are very precious i would take
the time to listen to what people have

195
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,349
to say

196
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,839
people appreciate a good listener I
would take the time to enjoy each day as

197
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:19,890
it comes

198
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,540
sometimes I am so busy looking forward
to what is coming up that I don't take

199
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,150
the time to enjoy the day that i am
living in

200
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,150
that's what I would do if I could go
back in my life

201
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,100
in fact I think I'll just make a habit
of doing all of those things all through

202
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
my life

203
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,829
joking joking is good jokes can be very
funny jokes can also be hurtful jokes

204
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,810
can be tasteless -

205
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,69
it is not an easy thing to find jokes
that do not offend anyone

206
00:15:00,70 --> 00:15:04,89
some jokes make fun of different races
those jokes are not funny

207
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,570
they are hurtful it is not right to tell
racist jokes many jokes use bad language

208
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,990
or are about questionable subject matter

209
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,779
these jokes are also not acceptable many
people are highly offended by rude jokes

210
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,779
what some people find funny others will
not

211
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,160
comedy is a very personal thing some
people like slapstick comedy

212
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,689
that is the kind of comedy that the
three stooges use some people like very

213
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,70
subtle humor

214
00:15:33,70 --> 00:15:37,300
some people will laugh at just about
anything sometimes it is not appropriate

215
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,389
to laugh but you feel like laughing
anyway

216
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,230
did you ever see anyone fall down did
you feel like laughing when they fell

217
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,980
down

218
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,449
you are probably worried that they had
hurt themselves yet the way that they

219
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:54,310
fell was so funny that you felt like
laughing it's not funny when someone

220
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,89
falls but you can't help but laugh even
though you try to hide it

221
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:04,240
jokes and comedy differ from culture to
culture many people from other countries

222
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,970
come here and don't understand our
comedy jokes and comedies are often

223
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,160
geared toward our environment sometimes
comedians make fun of the things that we

224
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,630
do in our day-to-day lives like going to
the bank are going grocery shopping

225
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,500
we can all relate to that being a
comedian is not an easy job telling

226
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
jokes and making people laugh is
extremely difficult

227
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,889
jokes are fun and they are funny if they
are good jokes can get you into a lot of

228
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,660
trouble if they are inappropriate and
sometimes they're just not funny

229
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,850
and nobody laughs here's a joke why does
the cow wear a bell

230
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,600
because its horns don't work do you get
it

231
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,660
do you think it is funny

232
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,579
well maybe it's not that funny I told
you that it was difficult being a

233
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,579
comedian

234
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,859
drugs there are two different types of
drugs

235
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,839
there are legal drugs and there are
illegal drugs legal drugs are the type

236
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,419
of drugs that the doctor gives you when
you were sick

237
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,480
illegal drugs are the drugs that people
sell on the street

238
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,960
illegal drugs are very dangerous if
someone ever wants you to try any type

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,660
of substance that you are not sure about
you should always say no people who sell

240
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,880
drugs on the street are criminals

241
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,150
if they get caught they will be sent to
jail

242
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,790
they sell drugs to get money they don't
care that people's lives are ruined from

243
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,930
taking drugs

244
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,950
if you take illegal drugs you can become
addicted to them

245
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,190
that means that you just have to have
the drug no matter what some people

246
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,40
steal from other people to get money to
buy drugs drugs affect your mind if you

247
00:18:03,40 --> 00:18:03,879
take drugs

248
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,160
you will not be able to think clearly
your marks in school drop your memory

249
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,750
won't be very good

250
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,750
your personality won't be the same

251
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,870
it is very unfortunate that some people
do try drugs they think that it won't

252
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,989
hurt them they are wrong if you are
smart you will stay away from all drugs

253
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,50
except for the ones that the doctor
gives you

254
00:18:29,50 --> 00:18:33,790
drugs are just bad news if you know
someone who is thinking about trying

255
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,820
drugs tell them that their entire life
could be ruined

256
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,560
in America they have a saying just say
no to drugs

257
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:48,310
it is a good saying but i think i would
rather say I'm just too smart to take

258
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,310
drugs

259
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,740
divorce

260
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,809
Mary's parents just got a divorce Mary
is very upset

261
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,370
she thinks that her parents don't love
her anymore she thinks that they got a

262
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,370
divorce because of her she is wrong

263
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,290
her parents love her just as much as
they always did they aren't getting

264
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,210
divorced because of Mary

265
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,679
sometimes marriages just don't work out
it isn't really anyone's fault

266
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,929
marriage isn't easy it is hard for two
people to stay together for a lifetime

267
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,158
sometimes people change as they get
older and they move on

268
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,210
some people have perfectly good
marriages and they stay together for

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,890
their entire lives

270
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,480
divorce doesn't happen because the
parents don't love the children anymore

271
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,710
a lot of children feel that it is their
fault but it isn't their fault at all

272
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,850
children either caused the divorce nor
can they prevent it

273
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,408
it is up to the parents divorce isn't
the end of the world

274
00:19:57,10 --> 00:20:00,279
children can still see both parents and
stay with them

275
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,559
life goes on sometimes children can get
new stepmothers or stepfathers that can

276
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,730
be a good thing

277
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,659
you just have to be understanding and
know that your parents still love you

278
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,610
life doesn't always go the way that we
planned it but it has its twists and

279
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,750
turns

280
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,750
life is an adventure if your parents got
a divorce

281
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:25,149
just be understanding know that they
love you and that this is a hard time

282
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,20
for them

283
00:20:26,20 --> 00:20:30,158
it is a hard time for you to but these
things have a way of working themselves

284
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,159
out in the end

285
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,130
if my fish could talk

286
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,880
I have a goldfish he swims around in his
bowl all day

287
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,000
he looks bored I look inside the bowl
and watch him his mouth always moves

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,730
he looks like he is talking I imagine
what my goldfish would say if he really

289
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,80
could talk

290
00:21:00,80 --> 00:21:03,740
I think he would say hey i'm bored in
this little Bowl

291
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,70
why don't you get me a bigger tank with
more fish in it

292
00:21:07,70 --> 00:21:10,70
I would like to have some friends to
swim around with

293
00:21:11,90 --> 00:21:14,659
I went out and bought a bigger tank for
my goldfish

294
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,440
I put some plants at the bottom of the
tank and I got a miniature deep sea

295
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,50
diver to put at the bottom of the tank

296
00:21:21,50 --> 00:21:25,820
I looked into the tank and imagine what
my goldfish was saying he seemed to be

297
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,639
saying this is a nice tank

298
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,20
it's roomy in here and you decorated it
well but i still don't have any friends

299
00:21:33,20 --> 00:21:38,480
to swim with i went to the pet store and
bought three more gold fish

300
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,770
I put them into the tank all of the
goldfish seem to look at each other they

301
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,129
swim near each other and seem to be
playing games

302
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,200
I knew which one was my goldfish because
he has a black spot on his fin

303
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,10
I looked at him and imagine that he was
talking again

304
00:21:55,10 --> 00:22:01,10
he said this is great i have a big new
home and friends to swim with these are

305
00:22:01,10 --> 00:22:03,680
nice goldfish that you brought home for
me

306
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,800
thank you goldfish can't really talk

307
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,120
i know that i just like to pretend that
my goldfish talks he seems very happy

308
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,360
now with his nice new home and his new
friends

309
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't think goldfish can smile either
but it looks like my goldfish has a

310
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
smile on his face

311
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:32,630
the best teacher

312
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,40
I have had a lot of teachers some of
them are good and some of them are

313
00:22:37,40 --> 00:22:37,940
boring

314
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,650
there is one teacher whom I remember
very well he is the best teacher that I

315
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,880
ever had

316
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,60
his name was mr. Alvin he was a history
teacher

317
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,440
history is not my favorite subject

318
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,60
I don't really enjoy history a lot when
I was in mr. albums class he made

319
00:22:56,60 --> 00:22:57,860
history seem exciting

320
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,149
he was more of an actor than a teacher
if he was describing a war he would make

321
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,600
us feel all the emotions that the
soldiers and their families would have

322
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,550
felt we could almost hear the guns
firing and the people shouting he would

323
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,919
paint a picture in our minds that was
very vivid when I had a history test in

324
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,610
this class

325
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,409
I didn't have to study much I would
remember every word that he had said I

326
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,890
would see him doing the actions that
went along with his stories

327
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,570
he was very animated he would shout out
orders as if he was a general or you

328
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,110
would speak softly and reverently when
describing the death of a great hero

329
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,510
the most important thing that I learned
from mr. Albin was that I did really

330
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,890
like history

331
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,610
I just thought that I didn't like it
because most people had made a doll by

332
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,740
just reading from the textbooks

333
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,220
history is not just a series of dates
and all facts

334
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,310
history is what really happened history
is real life

335
00:23:53,90 --> 00:23:57,770
all the historical figures had real
families and emotions they weren't just

336
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,570
fictional people after i took history
for mr. Alvin I realized that I really

337
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,820
did have an interest in it

338
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,80
he was my favorite teacher and I will
always be grateful to him for making me

339
00:24:09,80 --> 00:24:12,350
aware of just how interesting history
really is

340
00:24:23,59 --> 00:24:25,59
weather

341
00:24:25,59 --> 00:24:28,629
sometimes I watch the Weathermen on
television

342
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:32,379
it is fascinating to watch them . to
different areas of the country on the

343
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,39
map

344
00:24:33,39 --> 00:24:36,549
he tells us where the weather will be
nice and where it will be bad

345
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,960
the weatherman is not always right
weather reporting is not an exact

346
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,740
science

347
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,179
nothing is very exact when it comes to
the weather the weather department does

348
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,659
a lot of research but they can never be
sure of exactly what will happen

349
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,490
sometimes it looks like it will be clear
but the wind changes direction and

350
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,869
clouds move in the weatherman can warn
people if there is a chance of a

351
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,580
hurricane or tornado

352
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,320
the weatherman can also warn people of
floods sometimes entire towns have to be

353
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,570
evacuated because of bad weather

354
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,39
it is important to be aware of the
weather for example it is not good to be

355
00:25:12,39 --> 00:25:15,309
caught in the middle of a field when
there is going to be a thunderstorm

356
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,399
you might want to take extra precautions
if there is going to be a heavy

357
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,479
snowstorm

358
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,379
you would need to be in a secure place
of a hurricane or tornado was predicted

359
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:28,240
you might want to cancel a picnic if you
knew that it would rain that day the

360
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,369
weather affects us in so many ways

361
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,428
some people are really affected by dog
cloudy days

362
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,19
if there are no sunny days they become
very depressed heavy air pressure can

363
00:25:38,19 --> 00:25:42,789
cause some people to have headaches
weather affect all of us in one way or

364
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,999
another it is always a topic of
conversation

365
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:49,29
people often say things like hello it's
a beautiful day today

366
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:53,590
often we plan our lives and activities
around the weather

367
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,490
so if you are planning on walking home
tonight keep an eye on the sky

368
00:25:58,90 --> 00:26:01,90
are those rain clouds up there you might
need an umbrella

369
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
how to avoid catching a cold

370
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,20
how many calls do you catch in a year
most of my friends catch quite a few

371
00:26:20,20 --> 00:26:24,730
colts they cough sniffle and sneeze to
carry around tissues and blow their

372
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,230
noses all the time

373
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,30
their eyes water and they have scratchy
throats I don't get many colds in fact i

374
00:26:31,30 --> 00:26:33,940
can go for a whole year and never catch
a cold

375
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,420
this is why i consider myself an expert
on how not to catch a cold

376
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,150
I'll tell you how to avoid catching a
cult I think that you need to take a lot

377
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,410
of vitamin C

378
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,270
I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables I
drink fruit juice - I also take vitamin

379
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,320
c pills

380
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,100
whenever I begin to feel a cold coming
on I make sure that I have taken my

381
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,449
vitamin C pill and I drink a lot of
orange juice that usually knocks the

382
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,640
cold right out of my system

383
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,260
I make sure that I get a lot of fresh
air in the winter a lot of buildings are

384
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,340
shut up tight so that the air is stale
and people's germs circulate through the

385
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,340
building's I get outside and breathe in
fresh clean air if somebody is rude

386
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,570
enough to confer sneeze right in front
of me without covering his or her mouth

387
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,10
I just hold my breath for a second I'm
not sure if this works or not but I

388
00:27:24,10 --> 00:27:28,570
don't want to breathe in anybody's cold
germs many germs are passed through

389
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,530
hands

390
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,740
it is important to wash your hands
thoroughly if you touch anything in a

391
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,790
public place

392
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,970
if I hold a banister while I'm walking
down the stairs

393
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,750
I think of all the people who have used
that banister and I make sure that I

394
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,120
wash my hands before I eat

395
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,320
door knobs also have a lot of germs on
them money is another thing that is

396
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,710
passed from hand to hand and is covered
with germs

397
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,70
sometimes I see people stick money into
their mouths

398
00:27:54,70 --> 00:27:56,679
just think of all the germs that you
would be putting into your mouth if you

399
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,670
did that

400
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,960
if you just give it a little bit of
thought you can avoid a lot of germs

401
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,100
that cause colts if you eat good food
and stay fit your body will be able to

402
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,100
fight off the germs that cause colds and
other diseases

403
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,290
it is not always possible to avoid cold
but if you do catch a cold drink plenty

404
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,290
of fluids and get a lot of rest

405
00:28:25,49 --> 00:28:26,658
the future

406
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:30,979
I sometimes wonder what life will be
like in the future life has changed so

407
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,289
much in just the past few years

408
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,710
I'm sure that there are still big
changes that are coming

409
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,720
do you think will still drive cars maybe
we'll get into computerized vehicles

410
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,679
that we won't have to drive will just
push a few buttons and the vehicles will

411
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,19
take us to where ever we have to go

412
00:28:48,19 --> 00:28:51,320
maybe there won't be roads you might
just fly through space to get where we

413
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,509
want to go instead of telephones we'll
just use our computers will be able to

414
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:00,379
see each other when we talk that type of
thing is already happening

415
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:05,330
maybe we won't have to cook our meals we
might be able to push buttons to order

416
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,918
whatever we want a nice roast beef
dinner or an ice cream sundae might just

417
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,639
pop out of a machine would be nice to
have a robot to clean the house for you

418
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:19,99
in the past few years computers have
been extremely important people used to

419
00:29:19,99 --> 00:29:20,928
write to each other through the mail

420
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:24,499
now people communicate so much more
frequently through email

421
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,669
most of my friends own computers if we
had all of these things to do the work

422
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:29,419
for us

423
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:33,769
what would we do we would still need
people to program the computers we could

424
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,749
spend more time being creative

425
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:41,330
rather than doing everyday chores the
future holds many surprises

426
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,439
I'm sure that technology will become
even more and more amazing when my

427
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,529
parents were young they had never even
seen a color television

428
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,658
nobody owned a computer it doesn't take
long for things to change a lot

429
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,659
who knows what amazing things are in
store for us

430
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,370
giving a speech

431
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,110
I had to give a speech last week I gave
a speech - 300 people have to speak in

432
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,639
front of a group of students

433
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,970
I had to tell them about a campaign that
we were having to raise money for cancer

434
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,230
research

435
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,370
giving a speech can be a difficult thing
when you stand in front of a big crowd

436
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,930
you can get very nervous some people
feel like they have weak knees their

437
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,40
legs feel as if they are made of rubber
their heartbeats very hard inside of

438
00:30:28,40 --> 00:30:30,320
their chests their palms get sweaty

439
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,460
some people even become short of breath
for some people giving a speech is their

440
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,100
worst fear when you give a speech

441
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,270
everyone is looking at you they're
waiting to hear what you have to say

442
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,480
when you have 300 people looking at you

443
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
you have six hundred eyes that are on
you it is a little frightening when you

444
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,530
think of it that way before I give a
speech

445
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,870
I take three big breaths I call myself
and I remind myself that what I have to

446
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,610
say is important

447
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,389
I like to be sure of what i am going to
say so I practice my speech in front of

448
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,770
a mirror at home

449
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,889
I like to look like I am relaxed and
friendly

450
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,880
they say that practice makes perfect so
the more speeches that you give the

451
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,929
better you will become at it whenever I
have to give a speech

452
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,309
I imagine that the audience is just one
big person I look out into the audience

453
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,100
until I find a friendly smiling face

454
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,330
I focus on that person and I pretend
that I am just talking to them

455
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,520
I've become used to giving speeches I'm
more relaxed now than I used to be

456
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,850
people tell me that i do not look
nervous at all

457
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,199
I like to hear that sometimes I do feel
a little flutter of nervousness but I

458
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,960
just ignore it and do the best that I
can

459
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,920
giving a speech is not as scary as it
appears to be anyone can do it with a

460
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,920
little practice

461
00:31:54,70 --> 00:31:57,290
moving to another country

462
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,180
my friend Steve moved to another country
he had lived in Canada all his life and

463
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,380
he moved to Japan life in japan was very
different for Steve than what he was

464
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,640
used to at first steve suffered from
culture shock

465
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,990
his whole life seem different he was not
used to the way of life in Japan

466
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,580
steve was not used to the large crowds
of people that walked up and down the

467
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,550
streets in japan in his hometown in
Canada

468
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,930
the streets were fairly quiet Steve had
to get used to the food in Japan the

469
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,670
people eat a lot of fish

470
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,970
Steve had never eaten much fish before
Steve wanted pizza

471
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,800
but it was expensive in Japan steve said
that he had to adjust his eating habits

472
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,990
the people in Japan have different
customs then we do here in Canada

473
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,919
Steve didn't want to offend anyone so we
had to learn the customs

474
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,530
he had to learn about what Japanese
people considered polite and fruit

475
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,700
sometimes in a foreign country you can
do something to insult someone without

476
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,580
even realizing that you are being rude

477
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,260
at first steve had trouble with the
language he said that the only way to

478
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,810
really learn the language is to talk to
people

479
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,340
Steve talked to a lot of people he made
a lot of mistakes but people were

480
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,870
patients with him and they tried to help
him with his Japanese it wasn't long

481
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,870
before steve felt more comfortable in
his new surroundings

482
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,250
you have to be willing to learn new
customs and a new language if you move

483
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,110
to another country c feels very
comfortable in japan and in canada now

484
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,669
he is thinking about going to another
country now he thinks that he might like

485
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,410
to try and live in Italy

486
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,10
I'm sure that he would get over his
culture shock very fast if he moved

487
00:33:37,10 --> 00:33:37,670
there

488
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,230
moving to a new country can be difficult
but if you are willing to learn

489
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,230
it can be a very rewarding experience

490
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,190
look for the beauty

491
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,740
I've learned that things don't always go
the way that they were planned

492
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,120
if something doesn't happen the way that
I wanted to I try to make the best of

493
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
the situation

494
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
I always try to find something good and
everything that happens

495
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,780
last year I broke my ankle when I was
walking on an icy sidewalk at first I

496
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,30
was very upset i was missing school and
there was a party that I wanted to go to

497
00:34:18,30 --> 00:34:21,750
I couldn't do very much of anything my
ankle was very sore

498
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,650
I stayed home and I read a book it was
an excellent book and one that I

499
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,280
probably would not have had time to read
under normal circumstances

500
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,630
my friends brought my homework to my
house and we had some really nice visits

501
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,830
while they were here

502
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,29
I had to accept the fact that i couldn't
go anywhere on my broken ankle so i made

503
00:34:39,30 --> 00:34:41,430
the best of a bad situation

504
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,909
once I lost my way when I was out
camping

505
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,719
I ended up in a very large field was
afraid that nobody would find me but I

506
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,589
calmed myself down and took time to
examine all the interesting wildflowers

507
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,610
in the field

508
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,270
my family did find me they're surprised
at how calm I was

509
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,200
I've learned that there is something
valuable inside every adventure and

510
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,759
something beautiful inside every person
we had a new boy who came into our class

511
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,20
his clothes origin style and he was not
particularly handsome

512
00:35:10,20 --> 00:35:14,130
some of the boys and girls made fun of
him sometimes people can be really cruel

513
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,300
he seemed to handle it all right but
inside I knew that it must hurt

514
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,40
some of my friends and i invited him out
with us we found out that he had a

515
00:35:23,40 --> 00:35:27,240
terrific sense of humor and he is
probably one of the nicest people I've

516
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,379
ever met

517
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,850
he has since become one of my best
friends makes me ashamed when someone

518
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,460
that I know judge someone by how they
look

519
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,870
it isn't fair to do that you'll find
that something good comes out of almost

520
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,759
every situation

521
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
you'll find something good about almost
everyone that you meet

522
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,660
if you look hard enough if something
doesn't work out the way you planned it

523
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,680
just make the best of the situation look
for the beauty in everything

524
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,290
my doll

525
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,90
when I was an infant I got a rag doll it
was a very plain little doll and it wore

526
00:36:04,90 --> 00:36:06,430
a clown outfit and a clown's hat

527
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,149
I used to take back dolls to bed with me
every night I couldn't go to bed without

528
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,990
my doll

529
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,649
my mother used to pretend that the doll
was talking to me she would make the dog

530
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,420
dance and sing songs

531
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,920
I would talk to the doll my mother would
answer for the doll but I was a baby

532
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,510
I thought that the doll was actually
talking to me that doll was my best

533
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,380
friend

534
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,340
I took her everywhere one time I took
her to a store with me and I left her on

535
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,810
a shelf in the store

536
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,740
we were halfway home when I realized
that didn't have my doll with me

537
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,370
I was very upset my mother and I rushed
back to the store

538
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,720
my doll was still there I was so
relieved I hug my doll and I promised

539
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,629
myself I would never leave her anywhere
again

540
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,500
I couldn't imagine life without that
doll through the years the doll became

541
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,580
less important in my life and other
things to do but the dogs still sat on

542
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,200
my bed during the day and I still took
it to bed at night I gave that doll a

543
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
lot of love when I was little

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,470
in fact I loved that doll so much that
she looks tattered and torn now there

545
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,560
are parts of her face and hands are
almost worn away

546
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,820
I have a lot of other toys when I was
little but none of them were ever so

547
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,830
important as that doll

548
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,759
I don't play with toys anymore but that
doll is still in my room

549
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,870
she sits in a special chair in the
corner I'll always have that doll

550
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,190
no matter how worn out she is always
keep her and cherish her as part of my

551
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,710
early child

552
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,30
childhood child

1
00:00:03,70 --> 00:00:09,730
I am curious I am curious about many
things i would like to find the answers

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,139
to a lot of questions that i have one
holds the stars up in the sky

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,000
why does ice form on the top of the lake
when it is cold

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,269
is there life on other planets why do we
not fall off the face of the earth

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,448
how did caterpillars turn into
butterflies all of these things are

6
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,830
mysteries to me

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,949
there are so many questions that are
unanswered

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,19
I think I should go to the library and
get a book to find out why people grow

9
00:00:41,20 --> 00:00:42,70
old

10
00:00:42,70 --> 00:00:47,890
what makes a television work i also want
to know where electricity comes from

11
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,289
who is the strongest person in the world
who was the smartest person in the world

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,120
why does some people have blonde hair
and some people have black hair

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,529
why do people in different countries
speak different languages

14
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,710
why do people have to die why are no two
snowflakes are alike

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,610
what makes people fall in love

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,710
what makes the rivers run why does the
sunrise every morning

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,649
how did the oceans form why did the
dinosaurs vanish from the earth

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,479
I wonder if I'll ever find out the
answers to all of my questions

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,000
I think I'll have to study hard and stay
in school to find out everything that I

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,960
want to know some questions never get
answered it is good to be curious people

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,240
who are curious about things are the
ones who learn a lot and some curious

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,829
people go on to invent things and make
important discoveries

23
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,740
creative people some people are just
born to create that's what I think some

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,780
people just have the need to write
stories composed beautiful music or

25
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,570
paint pictures creativity seems to be
inside them and they need to let it out

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,840
it's good that we have people like that
composers like Mozart and Chopin have

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,900
given us music that is incredibly
beautiful

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,890
it's not just the classical composers
who have given us great pieces of music

29
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,529
there are modern composers who have
written great songs also Elton John is

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,610
an example of someone who has composed
many wonderful songs

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,540
andrew lloyd webber has given us some
very popular musicals like cats and the

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
Phantom of the Opera

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,950
there are so many talented and creative
people in this world when you visit an

34
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,920
art gallery you marvel at how artists
are able to recreate realism or make up

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,220
something that seems totally unreal yet
beautiful

36
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,130
the American artist Norman Rockwell
painted some pictures that actually look

37
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
like photographs

38
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,109
he tried to portray life as it was in
America through his paintings one can

39
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,590
get a good sense of American life
through the years

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,140
on the other hand artists like Jackson
Pollock did not portray realism Jackson

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,190
Pollock painted

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,799
abstract pictures his paintings are just
as good as Norman Rockwell's but they

43
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,410
are entirely different some books that
we read our classics

44
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,799
Mark Twain portrayed american life
through his characters

45
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,780
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn Charles
Dickens brought Victorian England to

46

life through his books

47
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,989
most people are familiar with his
Christmas Carol where the mean and

48
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,890
miserable Scrooge learns the true
meaning of Christmas

49
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,660
people don't have to read the classics
there are modern writers who entertain

50
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,579
readers through their stories

51
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,580
Stephen King has written a number of
horror stories some of his books

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,40
have even been made into movies we are
lucky to have creative people who share

53
00:04:14,40 --> 00:04:18,779
their gifts with us if you are lucky
enough to be creative

everything is blurry i keep getting
headaches

95
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,180
I told my mother about it and she made
an appointment with the up tom at rest

96
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,210
I went to a place where they made me
read words and letters on a chart some

97
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,479
of the words were big and some were very
small

98
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,340
I tried to read everything but sometimes
I couldn't see some of the small letters

99
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,820
the optometrist would cover one of my
eyes while i read the charts

100
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,909
then she would cover my other eye

101
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,940
she even put some drops in my eyes

102
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,920
I asked the optometrist if I had passed
or failed the test

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,570
she laughed and said it wasn't that kind
of tests that you passed or failed

104
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,280
she was just tried to find out if I
needed classes

105
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,830
I did meet glasses my mother and I
looked around there were many pairs of

106
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,909
frames

107
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,220
I wanted something that was in style I
tried on many pairs of frames

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,510
some of them look good on me and some of
them look really funny on me

109
00:08:16,20 --> 00:08:19,409
I finally chose a frame that was my
favorite

110
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,740
I gave them to a lady who did some
measurements

111
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,80
she told me to come back on Friday to
get my classes on friday i got my

112
00:08:28,80 --> 00:08:34,199
glasses my friends like them they said i
looked smart in my classes I wore them

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,810
to school on monday and i was able to
see the blackboard clearly I didn't

114
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,30
realize how much I hadn't been able to
see now I don't get headaches anymore

115
00:08:45,30 --> 00:08:48,329
i'm glad that i have my glasses

116
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,110
everything is a lot clearer now

117
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,689
I am clumsy my mother says that I am
clumsy

118
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,000
my father says that I am clumsy i know
that i am clumsy

119
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,979
I do things all the time that are clumsy

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,269
I fall down for no reason at all if
there is a crack in the sidewalk

121
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,630
I will be sure to trip on it and fall
down if I carry a plate of food in the

122
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,920
cafeteria

123
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,300
I almost always either drop it or bump
into someone with it

124
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't try to do these things it just
happens when i drink juice

125
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,630
i miss my mouth and get juice all over
my shirt

126
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,779
I always have something spilled on my
clothes

127
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,519
last week I opened a jar of peanut
butter the jar flew out of my hands and

128
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,130
landed upside down on the floor

129
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,260
there was a big glob of peanut butter on
the floor yesterday I knocked over the

130
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,310
sugar bowl

131
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,739
there was a big sticky mess on the floor
I bumped my head when I get into the car

132
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,899
I ripped my pants on things I lose my
money out of my pockets

133
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,670
I step on the cat's tail I always feel
bad when i do that because the cat

134
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,229
thinks I don't love her

135
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,10
I don't need to do these things I am
just a clumsy person

136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,120
my parents tell me to slow down

137
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,329
I am always in a hurry maybe that's why
I'm so clumsy

138
00:10:25,19 --> 00:10:28,380
maybe it's just the stage that I'm going
through

139
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,649
if it is I hope it is over soon

140
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,829
being clumsy is no fun at all

141
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,510
home alone I remember the first time
that my parents left me home alone

142
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,870
I was very grown-up and I thought that I
would be just fine

143
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,790
I was fine for a while i watch
television and had something to eat

144
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,910
I called my friend on the phone and we
talked for a while then I sat down to

145
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,50
read a book

146
00:11:03,50 --> 00:11:06,410
the house was quiet very quiet

147
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,530
I found myself listening very carefully

148
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:14,000
I heard a tap tap tapping noise I
wondered where it was coming from

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,670
it seemed to be coming from the window I
turned out the lights so that nobody

150
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,150
would see me and I peeked out the window
carefully

151
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,600
I was expecting to see a robber tapping
at my window

152
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,940
there was nobody there it was just a
tree branch swaying in the breeze and

153
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,270
tapping at my window I felt silly

154
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,630
I turned on the lights and sat back down
to read my book

155
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,440
a few minutes later I heard some
creaking noises

156
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,270
I listen carefully then I heard a
clunking noise

157
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,510
I think it might have been the furnace
then there was a whirring noise my

158
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,150
imagination began to play tricks on me

159
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,500
I was imagining that there were all
kinds of creatures in the house

160
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,810
I told myself to grow up I wouldn't let
my imagination run away with me

161
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,840
I was glad when my parents got home I
told them about all the noises that i

162
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,340
had heard my parents laughed and said
that all houses make noises

163
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,10
we're usually just so busy that we don't
hear all the noises that go on

164
00:12:22,10 --> 00:12:25,490
I have stayed home alone many times now

165
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,570
I just ignore all the little creaks and
noises that I here

166
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,570
I'm still alert and listen for anything
suspicious

167
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,710
but i know that there are lots of noises
that are harmless that tree that taps of

168
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,260
my windows still frightens me sometimes
but I'm a lot braver now then I was the

169
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,260
first time that I stayed home alone

170
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,249
family what does the word family means
to you

171
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:06,310
the easiest way to define family is to
talk about who you are related to

172
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:13,540
usually there is a mom and a dad and
children who are brothers and sisters

173
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,349
this would be the core family then there
is the extended family which would

174
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:27,639
include grandparents aunts and uncles
cousins nieces and nephews and in-laws

175
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,680
people married to your brothers or
sisters husband or wife

176
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:41,50
however i think the word family has a
much deeper meaning the word family

177
00:13:41,50 --> 00:13:51,758
brings words to my mind like love
support help kindness fun love trips

178
00:13:51,759 --> 00:14:02,19
closeness love for giving sharing love
understanding respect and love

179
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:08,110
you'll notice one word that is repeated
over and over again love

180
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,990
I believe if a family has real love for
one another they will be able to

181
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,920
overcome any problems they may have
actually they may not have too many

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,339
problems if they all love and respect
one another

183
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,959
however there are things that cannot be
helped

184
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,319
like death sickness or accidents

185
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:37,809
it is during those hard times that our
families love helps them to go through

186
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:44,199
those experiences we had quite a few
children in my family there were

187
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,750
brothers and sisters which included an
adopted brother and a number of foster

188
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,990
children - I was also very fortunate
that I had both my mom and dad to live

189
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,379
with and do things like vacations
together we had a lot of fun and there

190
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,990
were sometimes of tears -

191
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,310
above all we love one another family is
a wonderful thing

192
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I am so lucky

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,600
my first job my first real job was
during my last year of high school I had

194
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,190
taken classes in various business
subjects in that last year of high

195
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,000
school

196
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,730
we could do a co-op that meant we could
work part of the time instead of going

197
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,540
to school it would count as a credit
towards our diploma

198
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,500
the place i got a job was at a men's
tailor shop

199
00:15:48,10 --> 00:15:53,620
the owners were a very nice older german
couple they had two other men working

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,60
for them to one of the men had had brain
surgery for cancer

201
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,349
he had a big long scar all around the
top of his head

202
00:16:03,70 --> 00:16:08,50
he told me all about it he was always
happy and full of fun

203
00:16:08,50 --> 00:16:13,930
I thought he was very brave the tailor
shop made suits to order one of the

204
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,969
salesmen would measure the man and the
customer would choose a fabric and style

205
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,190
for he or his wife

206
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,550
light the people in the back of the shop
would then cut and sew the suit suits

207
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,439
cost a lot of money

208
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,390
there were also suits already made that
the customer could buy instead if they

209
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,140
wished they could also rent suits or
tuxedos for weddings or parties i worked

210
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,580
at a little desk

211
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,500
I answered the phone wrote letters filed
papers and did some bookkeeping

212
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,500
it was about a mile walk from my school
to work i passed many clothing shops

213
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,870
that wasn't good because i spent a lot
of my money that I earned in those shops

214
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,230
I worked at the tailor shop for almost a
year

215
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,360
it was a good experience and helped me
get my next job with the United States

216
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,319
Navy

217
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,319
that was fun too

218
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,109
first trip away from home today I'm
going to my friends house

219
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,439
her name is Valerie this is going to be
my first trip away from home without my

220
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,720
parents my dad is driving me to
Valerie's house and i'll be staying

221
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,580
there for two weeks

222
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,39
her mom will drive me back home it takes
about one and a half hours to get there

223
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,110
I have to pack enough clothes for play
work and church

224
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,49
i hope i'll pack the right things of
course i have to remember my toothbrush

225
00:17:52,49 --> 00:17:53,760
and hairbrush

226
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,730
Valerie lives on a farm I'll be helping
her dad with milking the cows

227
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,820
I think we'll play up in the hayloft

228
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,309
after we have helped put that Bales into
the barn will be all bitchy when the job

229
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,149
is done

230
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,510
there are a lot of things to do on a
farm

231
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:19,260
her mom is a good cook and will feed us
well there is a nice pond where we can

232
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,760
go swimming

233
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,559
I mustn't forget my bathing suit I
wonder if the farm dog comes into the

234
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,960
pond to that would be funny

235
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,159
my dad and mom are giving me money just
in case we go shopping

236
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,49
I hope we do go shopping because i want
to buy lots of candy

237
00:18:37,49 --> 00:18:40,710
I won't tell my mom that oh dear

238
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,650
I hear dad yelling let's go I haven't
even finished packing my things yet i

239
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,890
guess i better stop writing this now and
get busy fast

240
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,890
bye

241
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:57,890
my job

242
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,340
I work at a conservation park called
balls falls

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I've only worked there for three weeks
now

244
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,370
I am a tour guide and I tell people the
history of all the old buildings there

245
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,110
somebody told me that one of the houses
i work in is haunted

246
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,370
now I get chills every time I walk into
that house

247
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,50
my boss told me that the stories are
real but i have an active imagination

248
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,490
balls balls is very beautiful

249
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,70
it has two different waterfalls the
upper falls and the Lower Falls there

250
00:19:34,70 --> 00:19:40,189
used to be tons of water cascading over
them which turned a big water wheel to

251
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,510
grind grain

252
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,700
however through the years the amount of
water has really lessened

253
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,710
I love working at balls balls because i
get to work outside a lot i'm getting a

254
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,810

with kids they're at a day camp

255
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,720
I am getting ready now making different
crafts and thinking of fun new games to

256
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,830
play

257
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,720
