1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 and the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector fro Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,078
 Hector and Annie are in love.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
 Bridget likes to party and party.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 And Nick will do anything
 to earn some money.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,198
 I love this time of year.

8
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
 Sleigh bells, mince pies,
 presents under the tree!

9
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,519
 What? Easter?

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 No, silly! Christmas!

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
 I'm going to show you what
 a traditional English Christmas is like.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 Starting with...mistletoe.

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,999
 Mistle-toe?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,958
 It's an English tradition.

15
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,959
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
 But I am not under any mistletoe.

17
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,919
 You are now.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,159
 Oh, you poor things!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,398
 You're stuck together again.

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,399
 Don't worry, I can help!

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,798
 There, panic over!

22
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,839
 - Right, I'm off.
 - What?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,918
 Another television party?

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,919
 Not a party, three more parties.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,118
 And that's just tonight.

26
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,119
 But you've been to a Christmas
 party every night for two weeks.

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,159
 I know.
 It's so difficult being so popular.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First, there's a champagne party
 at the Savoy,

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 then at nine o'clock
 I'll get a taxi to the Ritz

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,878
 and get changed on the way...

31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,599
 What? In the taxi?

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,439
 Naturally.

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 And then at 1 1 :30
 I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.

34
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,998
 Annabel - who is she?

35
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,999
 Annabel's - the night club.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
 Will you change your clothes
 in the taxi again?

37
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,519
 And there I hope
 I Will meet a young, handsome man.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 An early Christmas present!

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 I hate Christmas!

40
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,079
 Did you have a bad day
 at the grotto, dear?

41
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,759
 - Nick, is that snow?
 - No.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,398
 Well, what,s that on your beard then?

43
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,399
 I was holding this baby...

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 when suddenly...

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
 - Christmas!
 - But children Love Christmas.

46
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,358
 - Is the money good?
 - Yeah.

47
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,399
 Well, stop complaining then!

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 Hector and I are going to have
 a lovely Christmas, aren't we?

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 Christmas is all about
 parties and presents!

50
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,079
 So, Bridget, have you got your
 Christmas stocking ready?

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
 She's taking her stockings off
 in the taxi!

52
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,959
 Don't wait up.

53
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,518
 What is a Christmas stocking?

54
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,519
 On Christmas Eve,
 you hang up your Christmas stocking

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes
 and fills it up with presents!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 Who put that sleigh there?

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 My sleigh! I forgot!

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Mind my leq.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 Right, right...
 Whoa! Not too fast!

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,719
 I feel terrible!

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Poor Bridget. Are you in pain?
 - No.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,519
 But what about the parties?
 I can,t go like this!

63
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,599
 I could take you dancing!

64
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,759
 Christmas is cancelled!

65
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,719
 - Is that it?
 - Yeah, crackers are great!

66
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,359
 So, what else
 do you have at Christmas?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Mince pies. How do you make them?

69
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,559
 It's just pastry and mincemeat.

70
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,718
 - Mincemeat?
 - Yeah, it's traditional

71
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,719
 It's sultanas, raisins and spices.
 It's mince...

72
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,079
 - Meat.
 - Yeah.

73
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,159
 Listen to this.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 What do you get
 if you cross a chicken with a clock?

75
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,719
 - I don't know.
 - An alarm cluck!

76
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,319
 An alarm cluck!

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 I don't get it.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 An alarm cluck!

79
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,999
 One a cluck, two a cluck...

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,079
 A clock?

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,398
 Mistle-toe?

82
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,319
 It's an English tradition.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 When you stand under it,
 you can kiss someone.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 I was holding this baby...
 when suddenly...

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 It's so difficult being so popular.

86
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,639
 My sleigh! I forgot!

87
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,158
 Mince pies!

88
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,999
 First, the pastry!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And now the minced meat
 from the best butcher!

90
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,439
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

91
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,199
 Well, I've finished
 all my Christmas shopping.

92
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,198
 Oh, madam!

93
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,199
 Refreshment? Mince pie?

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
 Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,958
 I followed the re-ceep.

96
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,879
 - Pee.
 - Mince pee?

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,478
 No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.

98
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,479
 Re-ci-pe.

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,918
 Something wrong?

101
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
 Delicious...Delicious.

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 You know, Hector,
 Christmas is all about sharing.

103
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,279
 Would you like some, Charley?

104
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,439
 It's Saint Nicholas!

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,878
 What happened to your beard?

106
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,879
 One Christmas candle,
 one small child...

107
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,759
 Mince pies, yummy!

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 With best mince from the best butcher.

109
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 Hector. What did you put in the pies?

110
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,199
 Minced meat - from the best butcher.

111
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,598
 This is mincemeat.

112
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,599
 This is minced meat.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,958
 Isn't it the same thing?

114
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,959
 - Not quite.
 - Delicious!

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,278
 I've got an idea!

116
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
 Let's make this a special Christmas,
 just for Bridget.

117
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
 Night-night.

118
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,999
 Hey, Bridget.

119
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,239
 - Do you want to come carol singing?
 - Who is Carol?

120
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,439
 Carols are Christmas songs.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 You knock on people's doors
 and sing to them for money.

122
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,799
 - Let's do it!
 - For charity!

123
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
 For poor little children.

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Some children have no Christmas.

125
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,599
 Just like me.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
 And your job as Santa Claus
 is so important.

127
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,959
 You help children
 to believe in Christmas!

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.

129
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,958
 My job is important!

130
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
 I help children to believe!

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,039
 Right, let's go!

132
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,638
 And that Will make you happy?

134
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,639
 Here, have a mince pie.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 All right.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Away in a manger...

137
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 Dog in a manger more like! Good night!

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 Silent night...

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
 I wish you were - all night!

140
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
 We Three Kings of Orient are

141
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,518
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

142
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,158
 Get Iost!

143
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,399
 Merrlly on high...

144
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,159
 Get 'em, Gnasher!

145
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
 Come all ye faithful

146
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,479
 Joyful and tri...

147
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,879
 Hi, Annie. I like the tree.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Thank you. It's nearly finished.

149
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 Please, use these. My decorations.

150
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,558
 Oh, sweet, Hector.

151
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,559
 - Are they from Argentina?
 - No.

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 Oxford Street.

153
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 - Aren't they great?
 - Great.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Hi, Nick.
 How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?

155
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Great! Such nice children.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 One of them
 let me play with his binoculars!

157
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,558
 Really?

158
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,159
 And I've just finished
 my Christmas shopping.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 - But the shops are shut now.
 - No.

160
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,359
 The petrol station was open.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,958
 Look I've bought my mum this.

162
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,279
 A map of Watford.

163
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 - But your mum doesn't live in Watford.
 - I know.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,078
 She might go there one day, though.

165
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,838
 I bought shampoo for my sister.

166
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,438
 Car shampoo.

167
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,439
 Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.

168
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 I like the tree...but I Love these!

169
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,998
 I've got some too.

170
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,999
 It was the Iast day of the grotto today,
 so they were throwing these away.

171
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 Can you believe it!

172
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,319
 No!

173
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,759
 Perfect.

174
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.

175
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,319
 Why?

176
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties,
 let's have a party here!

177
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,839
 - When?
 - Oh, I don't know.

178
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 In about 15 minutes?

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 Look at the Christmas tree!

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I know. It makes me want to cry too.

181
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
 What's the point of having Christmas
 if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now Christmas just makes me cry!

183
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,118
 Bridget, cheer up.

184
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,119
 Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

185
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,559
 Have you got your stocking?

186
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 Yes.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,519
 And I've got mine!

188
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 What are you hoping for? A motorbike?

189
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,079
 Yes! Why not?

190
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 The only thing
 that Will make this Christmas worse

191
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,799
 is if you invited all my friends round
 for a surprise party to cheer me up.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Surprise!

193
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
 And now the minced meat,
 from the best butcher!

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 They smell good, don't they, Charley?

195
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,639
 We Three Kings of Orient are

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,959
 One on a scooter, one in a car...

197
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 Good night!

198
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,279
 Joyful and tri...

199
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 Surprise!

200
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,359
 Hang on, I,m coming!

201
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 - Merry Christmas!
 - Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.

202
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 I'm sorry,
 we had a little party Iast night.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,959
 I'm here for dinner.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,998
 Isn't it a bit early?

205
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,999
 Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 - Bernard, where's your mother?
 - At church.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Well, I'll just go and get dressed.

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 To Bernard, Love from Annie.

209
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,198
 Sherry. Thanks, Annie.

210
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,638
 Nearly finished this one.

211
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,639
 To Bridget, Love from Annie.

212
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,479
 A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!

213
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label.
 It was meant for Charley.

214
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,479
 Is she sure it was meant for Charley?

215
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 To Bridget, from Hector.

216
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,119
 Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,199
 What To Wear At Christmas Parties.

218
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,999
 I bought it before you...

219
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,239
 I've got a little something for you, Nick.

220
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,519
 Gorilla -
 because you are the original man.

221
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,838
 It smells like a gorilla.

222
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,839
 Well, you should know.

223
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,599
 I wonder what this could be.

224
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,759
 Merry Christmas, sugar plum.

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 One heart, forever.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 This Will stop it!

228
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
 Bridget, nothing Will stop
 my Love for Hector.

229
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,119
 Well...

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I just called to say Merry Christmas!

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Hector.

232
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,879
 Bridget, what has happened to you?

233
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,079
 - I had an accident.
 - Oh, what a pity!

234
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,119
 You've missed some fabulous parties -

235
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,639
 especially at the Beckhams'.

236
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 Elton John is a very naughty boy!

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Still, never mind,
 there is always next year.

238
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,438
 OK, must dash.

239
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,318
 Off to a top restaurant for lunch.

240
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,639
 - Eunice?
 - Yes?

241
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?

242
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,679
 I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.

243
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,039
 It's true, there is a Santa!

244
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 And she's a woman! Wait for me!

245
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 I want to tell you
 what I really want for Christmas!

246
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,879
 - Can you smell something?
 - Yeah.

247
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Is something burning?

248
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
 I forgot - the turkey!

249
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 Water, water! We need water!

250
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,439
 Not on me! On the turkey!

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 Move! Move!

252
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 There. The fire is out.

253
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,879
 Anyone for turkey?!

254
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,998
 Shall we just have pudding?

255
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,999
 No mince pies, thanks.

256
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,958
 I have another surprise for you.

257
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,959
 Another English Christmas tradition.

258
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,479
 Chocolate log. One slice or two?

259
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,799
 Next time in Extra...

260
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,559
 Nick wants to join the SAS,

261
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 Bridget and Annie
 train the boys for action

262
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 and why is Hector home so late?

263
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!

264
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,559
 Hello, Hector!
