1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,158
 This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,

2
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,199
 who share a flat in London.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
 And the boys next door, Nick,
 and his friend Hector, from Argentina.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,798
 Annie and Hector are in love.

5
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:30,799
 Bridget and Nick are still dating, just.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
 But Nick is desperate for ajob. Anyjob.

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,518
 Hector, stop being such a baby.

9
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,639
 But it hurts!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 I haven't touched you yet.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
 Now stay still. You will
 just feel a little needle prick.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
 Go on then. Hurt me, do it!

13
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,799
 Hector!

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 Hector! I've done it.

15
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,959
 I've removed the splinter.

16
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,039
 Yes, I knew that. I was joking.

17
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,639
 What is it? Are you scared of needles?

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,359
 Who, me?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,519
 Don't be silly.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,520
 But it was a very painful splinter.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 OK, so if you're not scared of needles,
 would you have a tattoo?

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 A tattoo?

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,558
 Yes. Yes, I would.

24
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,559
 Go on, then, tough guy.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
 OK, I'll have one if you have one.

26
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,559
 OK.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
 OK, it's a deal.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,878
 By the way, Hector...

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
 I had this done this morning.

30
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,039
 But then, a deal is a deal, isn't it?

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 I want a word with you.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
 Tough guy, eh?

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 Yeah? What do you want?

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,439
 I don't...

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
 I don't...

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,319
 I keep forgetting this bit!

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 I don't like your face.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 OK, so is this for television or theatre?

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 Nope. This is real. This is me.

40
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,118
 And you are...

41
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,119
 Can't you guess?

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
 Guys, you are looking at Muscles.

43
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,839
 -  Where?
 -  No, no, no. It's my new name.

44
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,879
 I am the new man on the door at Ice.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 What, you're a bouncer?

46
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,158
 What is a bouncer?

47
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,159
 It's someone
 who throws people out of nightclubs.

48
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,279
 I am an entry executive.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 -  So you throw people out of the club?
 -  Yeah.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
 Yeah. Nick, my granny could beat you up.

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 But if your granny came to Ice
 and caused trouble,

52
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,719
 I would have to ask her to leave.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
 Besides, I'd have Knuckles,
 Cruncher and Muncher to back me up.

54
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,559
 Who?

55
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,719
 -  The other bouncers.
 -  Yeah, right.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,558
 -  Hi, sweetie.
 -  Has someone died?

57
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,359
 No, not yet.

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,478
 Why are you dressed in black then?

59
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,318
 Because, baby,

60
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,319
 you are looking at the new man
 on the door at Ice.

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,678
 You are on the door at Ice?

62
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,679
 But that's... But that's wonderful news!

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,639
 What shall I wear?

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
 I'll call the girls
 to find out what they're wearing.

65
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,479
 The thing is, Bridget,

66
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 if your name's not on the guest list,
 then you can't come in.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
 Nick, if my name's not on the guest list,

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 then you can't come home.

69
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,679
 Hello?

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,279
 Hi!

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,319
 Yep, that's right.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
 I start on Friday? OK, baby!

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 No probs. Leave it with me.

74
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:48,239
 Ciao!

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 My mum. She wants me
 to do some...gardening for her.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 I am the new man on the door at Ice!

77
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,799
 I don't like your face.

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,638
 If your name's not on the guest list,

79
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,639
 then you can't come in.

80
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,518
 Hector, I just won...

81
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,238
 What are you doing?

82
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,839
 Just looking for a number.

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,918
 I see.

84
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,919
 Well, I just wondered if you wanted
 to share my chocolate with me

85
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,999
 -  before Bridget sees it.
 -  Yeah! Great! Thanks.

86
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,838
 Annie?

87
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,839
 Did I tell you about the time
 three people tried to fight me?

88
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,439
 -  All at once?
 -  Yep.

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 Really? Well, go on.

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 Well, three of them, they came at me.

91
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
 Oh, you poor thing!
 And what did they want?

92
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,799
 My sweets.

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 -  And how old were you?
 -  Six.

94
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,959
 And they were...?

95
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
 Five, three and two.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 Hector! Two years old! They were babies!

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
 Yeah, but the Sanchez sisters
 were really tough!

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
 Hector, you are sweet.

99
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,519
 Do you think I should be more macho?

100
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,399
 Hector, you don't have to be
 a tough guy for me.

101
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,318
 I love you just the way you are.

102
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,919
 Annie.

103
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
 Come on, let's eat this chocolate
 before Bridget finds it.

104
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,799
 Please, let me.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You're so strong!

106
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,919
 -  What is it?
 -  You are standing on my foot.

107
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,039
 Wimp.

108
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
 -  Hi, Nick.
 -  Hi.

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 Hey, listen to this.

110
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,719
 Bouncer of the month is Alex Smith,

111
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,159
 who last year stopped 955 people

112
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,438
 from going into his club.

113
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,439
 -  What is the name of the club?
 -  It doesn't say.

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 It shut down last week.
 Not enough people were going there.

115
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,118
 Nick?

116
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,119
 What is a wimp?

117
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,079
 Well, it's not...

118
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,839
 Annie just called me a wimp.

119
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,559
 I want to be a tough guy, like you.

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
 Can you teach me, please?

121
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,879
 Of course, I was born like this,

122
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,919
 but I can try to help you, Hector,
 I can try.

123
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,039
 Great!

124
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 Why don't you show me
 how to be a bouncer.

125
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,040
 Att...i...tude.

126
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,598
 Att...i...tude?

127
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,599
 Yeah. Like this.

128
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,479
 Are you looking at me?

129
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 Are you looking at me?

130
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,719
 Are you looking at me?

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Are you looking at me?

132
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,040
 Hey, great!

133
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,119
 So who am I looking at
 when I say that?

134
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,799
 Anyone who is looking for trouble.

135
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,559
 And how do I know
 they are looking for trouble?

136
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 You just know.

137
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,479
 Look.

138
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,479
 What is this?

139
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,718
 Bridget's old toys.

140
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,719
 What are they
 doing under your bed, then?

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,719
 I was looking after them for her.

142
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,758
 Yeah, anyway, look.

143
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,759
 Here, this is the club.

144
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
 You cannot come in!

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,918
 Let me in!

146
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,919
 Are you looking at me
 or chewing a brick, eh?

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 Cos either way, you'll lose your teeth.

148
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 You know, brick, teeth, chew.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,998
 Very good!

150
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,999
 You are a very scary guy.

151
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,119
 Look! It's handsome Nick!

152
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 Look at his muscles.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 Hello! You are looking lovely tonight.

154
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,959
 Leave my boyfriend alone!

155
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,079
 It's OK, Bridget. I'm just doing my job.

156
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,799
 If your name's not on the guest list,

157
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,079
 then you cannot come in.

158
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,879
 If your name's not on the guest list,

159
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 then you cannot come in.

160
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,358
 Please could I have your name, sir?

161
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,359
 What do you want that for?

162
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
 Because if your name's not on the g...

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 guest list, you cannot come in.

164
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,199
 And what are you going to do about it,
 pip...squeak?

165
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,318
 I...

166
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,358
 I'm...

167
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
 I...

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 So be a good boy!

169
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,839
 Didn't you hear what the man said?

170
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 He said,
 'Go. Disappear. Vanish. Evaporate. Now!'

171
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 OK, I'm going!

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,878
 Sorry you had to see that, Bridget.

173
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,879
 Course, I had the situation
 completely under control.

174
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,918
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,839
 So, Bridget, why are you here?

176
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,199
 What?

177
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 -  I've brought you some sandwiches.
 -  Bridget, how nice of you.

178
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,399
 -  Where are they?
 -  Where are what?

179
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,439
 The sandwiches.

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
 I must have left them behind. Never mind!

181
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,079
 So, who's here tonight?

182
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 I'm afraid I can't tell you.
 It's confidential.

183
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,038
 OK.

184
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,758
 Well, there's the usual crowd.

185
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,759
 Heidi, Kate, Naomi.

186
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,519
 Sorry, Bridget. I have work to do.

187
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 Good evening, ladies!

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
 Could I have your names, please?

189
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,359
 Thank you. Just one more thing. Bridget!

190
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,840
 Arms up, please, ladies.

191
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Let me see. Very nice.

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 Thank you.

193
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,318
 Thank you very much, ladies.

194
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,319
 Have a great evening.

195
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 All part of the job.

196
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
 OK, Nick. So when is it my turn?

197
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,239
 I want to go in!

198
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 Bridget, Bridget, Bridget. I promise.

199
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,519
 As soon as I can arrange it, I will.

200
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 Look, there's a big Latino night next week.

201
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,439
 -  J- Lo will be coming.
 -  J- Lo?

202
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,559
 Leave it to me.

203
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
 Thank you, Nick!

204
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
 Stand back. I need to take control.

205
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,359
 Good!

206
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 Everything is under control.

207
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
 Wimp!

208
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,879
 Good evening, ladies!

209
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 I have the situation
 completely under control.

210
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
 -  J- Lo will be coming.
 -  J- Lo?

212
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,039
 Annie?

213
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
 About the tattoo.

214
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,559
 Look.

215
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 You did it!

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
 And Hector, what a wonderful tattoo!

217
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,159
 I don't know what to say!

218
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,198
 It was nothing.

219
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,519
 And I mean it.

220
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 Hector and Annie forever.

221
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 And look!
 Charley likes the tattoo as well.

222
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 Charley!

223
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
 Hector!

224
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
 Please. I've just eaten!

225
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,759
 Bridget, look.

226
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 Hector has had a tattoo done just for me!

227
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,519
 Isn't it romantic?

228
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,799
 Hec- ni- ver.

229
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 Hec- ni- ver? It doesn't sound
 very romantic. What does it mean?

230
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,078
 What's happened?

231
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,079
 It's coming off!

232
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 Charley has licked it off.

233
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,679
 It's a fake!

234
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 Hector, you wimp!

235
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,278
 -  Hector.
 -  Hi, Nick.

236
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,279
 -  What's the joke?
 -  I am.

237
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,158
 Listen.

238
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,159
 J- Lo is coming to Ice tonight,

239
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,440
 so we need extra bouncers.

240
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,399
 So you will be working with me
 on the door!

241
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,078
 But I...

242
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,079
 And tell Bridget and Annie
 they are on the guest list.

243
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,959
 -  OK, tough guy?
 -  OK.

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 Yeah.

245
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 Good evening, ladies!

246
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 You are looking lovely tonight.

247
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Hector, you look so handsome.

248
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,279
 I'm sorry I laughed at your tattoo.

249
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 Annie, Annie, Annie, I am on duty.

250
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,479
 Is J- Lo here yet?

251
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,358
 She's here.

252
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,359
 Goodie! I love mixing with the stars.

253
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,999
 -  Hi.
 -  Hello.

254
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,438
 She's cute.

255
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,439
 Hi, gorgeous.

256
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,959
 -  What did he say?
 -  Nothing.

257
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
 Was he...?

258
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,079
 -  What are you looking at?
 -  I am looking at you looking at her.

259
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,318
 I can look at her.

260
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,319
 Not when I am looking at her
 looking at you.

261
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 I think you mean, 'Not when
 I'm looking at you looking at her.'

262
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,398
 That is what I said!

263
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,399
 You know what? I tell you
 I'm gonna buy her a drink, OK?

264
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,079
 What did he say?

265
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 I think he said
 he's gonna buy her a drink.

266
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 Hector, no!

267
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
 Right, that is it! I am going in!

268
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,358
 No, Hector, don't! Leave it!

269
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,359
 Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!

270
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,079
 Nick! Nick!
 His mate is chatting up Bridget.

271
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,319
 Right, that's it! I'm going in!

272
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!

273
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 Muscles, you're fired!
 And so is your friend!

274
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,959
 That was great!

275
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,960
 I didn't even see J- Lo.

276
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,159
 See, Hector? I knew you weren't a wimp.

277
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,318
 Next time in Extra,

278
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,319
 Annie is revising for her exams,

279
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,918
 Bridget has a makeover,

280
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,919
 and guess who is coming to stay?

281
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:52,278
 andguess who is coming to stay?
