1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
 who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
 and the boys next door,
 Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,959
 Annie and Hector are dating

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
 and Bridget and Nick were dating,
 but that's history.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
 Now all Nick wants is a job,
 a babe or a motorbike.

6
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,038
 He's not fussy.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,039
 Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,119
 Oh, darling, no. I'll die without you.

9
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,039
 He's Robert. He ran away with Jenny.

10
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,878
 Oh, no!

11
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,399
 That's why she can't marry Lionel.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 -  That is so sad.
 -  I know.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 But doesn't Jenny know
 that Lionel is her brother?

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,198
 She had a car accident.

15
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,479
 She can't remember.

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 That is terrible!

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,599
 Quick, quick, quick, quick!

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,558
 Go on! Kick it! Kick it!

19
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,319
 Football! Hi, boys.

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,798
 -  Hi, Bridget.
 -  Hi, Bridget.

21
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
 -  I need your help.
 -  Sure. What is it?

22
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,559
 I'm going to buy
 a new computer for work.

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,799
 I know everything about computers.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,119
 Great!

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 I need one with a lot of gigabytes,
 good RAM memory,

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
 all the software compatibility
 and the top processor.

27
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,079
 Maybe this one?

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 No, this one hasn't got what she wants.

29
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,559
 And you understand what she wants?

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 Yeah. You don't?

31
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,679
 -  Of course I do.
 -  Well, so do I.

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,760
 So? Have you decided which one?

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,399
 Who's going to pay for it?

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
 It's for work, so they'll pay for it.

35
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,279
 -  This one, then.
 -  This one is the most expensive.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
 It's a nice colour.

37
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,598
 Well...

38
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,359
 It has everything you want.

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 Do you think more SDI sockets,
 or the analogue input?

40
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
 Forget it. I'll order it now.

41
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,679
 Come on, come on!

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,718
 What are you doing out here?

43
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,518
 Waiting for my examination results.

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,519
 Your results are arriving today?

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 What have you done to Teddy?

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 Brad Pitt is much more handsome
 than Teddy.

47
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,199
 Where is it?

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 Bill, bill, nothing, nothing, bill...

49
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,799
 It's not my examination results.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,958
 It's from the landlady.

51
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959
 It says we are too noisy.

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 Noisy?
 She's written to the wrong apartment.

53
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
 We're never noisy.

54
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 My new computer's here!

55
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,359
 Well, Nick? Open it.

56
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,519
 -  Why me?
 -  Nails.

57
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,359
 Anything else?

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,360
 Well, it's a very big box.

59
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,078
 What's that?

60
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,399
 I think it's the instructions.

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 Great. Have fun.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,838
 Wait! Where are you going?

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,038
 Shopping.

64
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,039
 You'd better have finished
 when I get back.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,079
 Better have finished what?

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Installing the computer.

67
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,519
 You do know everything about computers,
 don't you?

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
 No problem.

69
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,039
 The instructions are all in English.

70
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,559
 Look... Hector, here's a Spanish version.

71
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,519
 Yes...

72
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,399
 Right, let's do it.

73
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,519
 Or don't you know how to do it?

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 I could do it with my eyes closed!

75
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 Well, instructions are for girls!

76
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,398
 Oh, yeah!

77
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,999
 I am the man!

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Yeah, but I did all the work.

79
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:35,238
 You? I did it.

80
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,239
 I am the computer king.

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 -  Yeah?
 -  Yeah.

82
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,359
 -  You think you can beat me?
 -  I already did.

83
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,079
 Computers are easy.

84
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
 How about a real challenge?

85
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,279
 Whatever challenge you like.

86
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,399
 Right...

87
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,199
 Man Olympics. Challenge One.

88
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,360
 Who can put the most marshmallows
 in his mouth?

89
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,039
 -  Marsh...
 -  ..mallows.

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
 -  Look. One.
 -  One.

91
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,919
 -  Two.
 -  Two.

92
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,438
 -  Three.
 -  Three.

93
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,439
 -  Four.
 -  Four.

94
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,040
 I'm going to buy a new computer for work.

95
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 No, this one hasn't got what she wants.

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 And you understand what she wants?

97
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 Come on, come on!

98
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,919
 Where is it?

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
 How about a real challenge?

100
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
 -  One.
 -  One.

101
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,399
 Well, instructions are for girls!

102
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,438
 What's that? Love letters?

103
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,439
 No, I've got all the letters
 delivered to this building.

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 You've got the neighbours' letters?

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,239
 I'm sure my examination results are here.

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 Where are the boys?

107
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,838
 They've installed my computer!

108
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,839
 I think so.

109
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,399
 -  Is that normal?
 -  Bridget!

110
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,399
 Nick? Hector?

111
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,279
 What are you doing?

112
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 Man Olympics. Challenge Two.

113
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,678
 What kind of a challenge?

114
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,679
 Who can go the longest without...you know...

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
 Falling down? Sneezing? Jumping?

116
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,919
 No, no. Without going...

117
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,279
 Without doing...

118
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,238
 You want to spend a penny?

119
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:25,239
 Spend a penny?
 I don't want to go shopping!

120
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,399
 No, no, no. She means...

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
 Stop thinking about your challenge
 and follow me.

122
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
 Maybe I've passed!

123
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
 Maybe I've failed!

124
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 You're not going anywhere until it works.

125
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,719
 -  Oh, no!
 -  Here, let me try.

126
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 -  You think you can do better?
 -  I know I can do better.

127
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
 I know a way from my country.

128
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,999
 -  Really?
 -  Really.

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 My father taught me.

130
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
 Yes, we have that way in England too.

131
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 -  Hi, guys.
 -  Hi.

132
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,759
 Oh, no! What happened?

133
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,399
 -  It was like that before.
 -  It was not like that before.

134
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,998
 Sorry.

135
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,999
 What are you doing?

136
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,199
 Man Olympics. Challenge Three.

137
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
 Hi. I need a man.

138
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,398
 No, you idiot!

139
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,399
 I need a man
 to fix the computer I bought.

140
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,719
 Tomorrow? Good.

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 And I'd like him
 to be tall, dark, handsome...

142
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 Great, thanks. Bye.

143
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
 At last, a real man.

144
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 Hi, I need a man.

145
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,959
 It was like that before.

146
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
 -  It was not like that before.
 -  Sorry.

147
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
 It's Nick's phone.

148
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
 You have 23 new messages.

149
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,518
 Message one...

150
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,519
 Hi, bro.
 I've got all my friends to call you.

151
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,719
 I hear you and Bridget are history.

152
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
 That's great news.
 I didn't like her anyway.

153
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,518
 Message two...

154
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,519
 Hi, Nick. Izzie here.
 Melanie asked me to give you a call.

155
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,439
 I hear you and Bridget are history.

156
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,358
 Hello. What?

157
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,359
 Nicky Wick- wick is not here.

158
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
 Is that Emma?

159
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 Nick's told me all about you.

160
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 Yeah. You and your moustache.

161
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,559
 Nick!

162
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,599
 Mr Postman?

163
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
 Man Olympics. Challenge Five.

164
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,479
 Tug- of- war to see who is the strongest.

165
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,238
 They had a tug- of- war here?

166
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,239
 Yes. They are so stupid!

167
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
 -  Who won?
 -  I won.

168
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,239
 What's wrong?

169
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 I want my examination results.

170
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 -  Where's the post?
 -  Calm down.

171
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,319
 -  The postman!
 -  The computer man!

172
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
 Well, hello there.

173
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,159
 Come in!

174
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,878
 But...

175
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,879
 I know what you're going to say.

176
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,919
 -  But...
 -  It was like that when I bought it.

177
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,999
 So what do you think?

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It looks broken.

179
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 -  Well, can you repair it?
 -  No.

180
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,358
 -  You can't repair it?
 -  No.

181
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,359
 -  You don't know how to?
 -  No.

182
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,159
 Well, how can you be a repairman, then?

183
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,278
 I'm not.

184
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,518
 -  You're not a repairman?
 -  No.

185
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,278
 Well, what are you, then?

186
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,279
 I deliver special letters.

187
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,759
 My letter!

188
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,318
 Annie Taylor?

189
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,319
 -  Yes!
 -  This is for you.

190
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
 Man Olympics. New challenge.
 First one to get...

191
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 Annie's letter!

192
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,239
 It's mine!

193
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,079
 I can't look! You read it.

194
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,119
 Pass!

195
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
 Computer problem, miss?

196
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:19,599
 I can fix anything.

197
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,558
 My hero!

198
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,559
 Thank goodness you're here.

199
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,399
 How did he do that?

200
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,639
 -  Peter?
 -  Annie?

201
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
 -  It is you!
 -  Yes.

202
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,278
 He's Peter, an old friend.

203
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,279
 It was so clever of you
 to fix the computer.

204
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,399
 Good- looking and intelligent.

205
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,719
 A rare combination.

206
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,278
 Right!

207
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,839
 That's it!

208
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,438
 Man Olympics!

209
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,278
 New challenge.

210
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,038
 What challenge?

211
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,039
 Let's see who the real men are.

212
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,839
 Hector and me, or you two.

213
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,599
 -  OK.
 -  What's the challenge?

214
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,119
 -  Let us decide.
 -  Yes, we'll decide.

215
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,599
 Next time in Extra...

216
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,958
 Annie gets a new job.

217
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,799
 So does Hector.

218
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 And why does Nick
 become a beauty queen?

219
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,358
 And why does Nick
 become a beauty queen?
