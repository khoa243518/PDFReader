1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,118
 This is the story of Bridget and Annie,

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,078
 who share a flat in London.

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,958
 And the boys next door,

4
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,959
 Nick, and his friend Hector,
 from Argentina.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,398
 Annie loves Hector
 and Hector loves Annie.

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,399
 And Bridget and Nick are going out,
 most of the time.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 So, will the happy couples stay together?

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 Find out in Extra.

9
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,679
 Chocolate mousse!

10
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,799
 Peanut butter!

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,718
 Strawberry yogurt.

12
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,719
 Nice.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 Sorry, Annie. Exams. I forgot!

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 I won't make a sound.

15
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,119
 Sorry, Annie. I...

16
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,638
 Hector! Stop.

17
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,639
 Do not eat that apple.

18
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,079
 Sorry. You want it, Annie?

19
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
 No, Hector! It's too noisy!

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,519
 I am trying to revise!

21
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 My exams are next week!

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
 I need some classical music.

23
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,159
 Sorry, Annie, I...

24
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,879
 Help!

25
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,119
 Annie!

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
 Help!

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 Help!

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Annie?

29
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,919
 Annie!

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 Why is Hector
 hanging out of the window?

31
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,719
 Poor Hector!

32
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,439
 -  Hector, are you OK?
 -  Yeah.

33
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 The window is dirty.

34
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 Well, then, it's a job
 for a window cleaner, not you!

35
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 Hey, guys, look at these!

36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 It's pictures of my makeover!

37
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 What is a makeover?

38
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,599
 It's when they use make- up to turn this...

39
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,679
 into this!

40
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,239
 Just joking!

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,958
 Bridget, they're fantastic!

42
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,199
 You look like a film star!

43
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Cameron Diaz, watch out!

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 Were you wearing lots of makeup?

45
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,199
 No.

46
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,518
 Anyway, what are they for?

47
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,519
 Well, Nick wants to be
 a Hollywood movie star

48
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 and if he can do it, I can do it!

49
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,918
 Really?

50
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,919
 You are going to tell George Ducas
 about me?

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 What, the George Ducas,
 the Hollywood director?

52
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
 You're going to tell him
 what a great actor I am?

53
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,958
 Oh, Victoria!

54
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,959
 Thank you so much!

55
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 How can I thank you?

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 Can't anyone else do it?

57
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,559
 Yes! Of course
 I want you to tell George about me!

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,999
 No problem.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,159
 See you later.

60
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,160
 Ciao.

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 That was my friend, Victoria Yallop,
 the really good actress.

62
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,519
 Yeah, she's a really good actress.

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
 Nick, darling!

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 Well, guess what?

65
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,439
 She's going to tell George Ducas,
 the Hollywood director, all about you.

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,680
 -  Yeah! How did you know?
 -  Lucky guess.

67
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 And what do you have to do for her?

68
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,199
 Nothing.

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 She wants me
 to look after something for her.

70
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,319
 Victoria Yallop. Nick is expecting me.

71
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,199
 Nick, darling!

72
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
 This must be so much trouble for you!

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,318
 No problem. No problem at all.

74
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,278
 Sweet! OK, three rules.

75
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,279
 No meat, clean underpants in the morning
 and in bed by eight.

76
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,198
 Now meet...

77
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,598
 Where are you?

78
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,599
 Come here!

79
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,119
 Nick, meet Lucas.

80
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,319
 Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

81
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,439
 Hi.

82
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 Good joke!

83
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,359
 Well, I must dash.

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
 George is waiting for me.

85
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,519
 Don't worry, Nick,
 I'm going to tell him all about you!

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
 Lucas, be a good boy
 for Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

87
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,358
 Don't tell me.

88
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:23,359
 Nightmare On Elm Street.

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 Goodbye, darlings! Goodbye!

90
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,319
 I'm hungry.

91
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,198
 Nick?

92
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,199
 What is going on?

93
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,239
 Victoria's au pair
 has run off with the postman.

94
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,358
 So?

95
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,359
 So, she's got no one to look after Lucas.

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
 So, why can't she look after her own son?

97
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Because
 she's going to meet George Ducas.

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,558
 -  Where?
 -  New York.

99
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,399
 -  New York?
 -  She'll be back tomorrow!

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 Tomorrow?

101
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
 He's very sweet
 but what about my exams?

102
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,799
 He won't be a problem.
 You won't even notice him.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 We'd better not.

104
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 Hector! Stop.

105
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,119
 Say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,319
 Annie, have you seen these?

107
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,239
 You showed me earlier.

108
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,238
 No.

109
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,239
 Look.

110
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 It's that...that child!

111
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,559
 What's that noise?

112
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,638
 Lucas is playing ball.

113
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,639
 Oh, is he?

114
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,639
 You've made me do that.

115
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,599
 He's on my bike!

116
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 I know. Just don't go in the bathroom.

117
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
 I said don't go in the bathroom.

118
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:53,479
 And I don't know what he's done
 with the toilet paper.

119
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
 Poor Charley.

120
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,838
 I'm hungry.

121
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,839
 Nick, where have you been?

122
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 Shopping for Lucas.

123
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,799
 Nick, you must take control of him.

124
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,238
 Baby, I'm trying!

125
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,718
 Nick, I'm trying to work.

126
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,719
 I'm trying to revise for my exams.

127
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,640
 OK, OK. Very nice, Lucas.

128
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,999
 Maybe later?

129
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I know. Let's play games.

130
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,719
 -  I've got Twister.
 -  Great.

131
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
 Oh, OK, boys versus girls.

132
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,119
 So,
 I'll just move my left foot over to you.

133
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,918
 It is stuck!

134
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,919
 OK, I'll move my hand.

135
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
 Hey, I can't move!

136
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,639
 Nor can I!

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,519
 What's happening?

138
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 Lucas? What have you done?

139
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
 Lucas, come here!

140
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,839
 Lucas! Come on!

141
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,078
 Lucas!

142
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,079
 Please.

143
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 I'm going to tell him all about you!

144
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,518
 I'm hungry.

145
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,519
 I'm hungry.

146
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,438
 Hi, Lucas! Where have you been?

147
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,238
 To the zoo.

148
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,239
 -  Where's Nick?
 -  He had to take the penguin back.

149
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,679
 -  The penguin?
 -  Yeah. It must have fallen into my bag.

150
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,399
 What are you listening to?

151
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 I said, what are you listening to?

152
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,879
 Dog Puppy Dog.

153
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 Can I listen?

154
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 This is good!

155
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,038
 Sorry!

156
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,919
 Hector!

157
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 Lucas! Come here!

158
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 Lucas, why are you so...

159
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 Hey, that's me!

160
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,399
 Lucas, do you want to be like me?
 A news reporter?

161
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,878
 Well, to be a good news reporter

162
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,879
 you have to do everything exactly as I do.

163
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 All good newsreaders brush their teeth.

164
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,439
 Check.

165
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,799
 Comb their hair.

166
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,879
 Check.

167
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 -  And say good night.
 -  I'm hungry.

168
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
 Check. Good night.

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 Goodnight, sugar plum.

170
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,959
 Haven't you got a girlfriend, Lucas?

171
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 Girls are wonderful, especially Bridget.

172
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Girls are yuck, especially Bridget.

173
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:42,239
 Yeah, well, anyway, time for bed.

174
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 Nick, thank you for a lovely day.

175
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 Well, that's OK, little fellow.

176
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,359
 We'll have more fun tomorrow. Night night.

177
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 Sweet kid!

178
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,680
 How does he do that?

179
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
 I've had enough of you, you little...

180
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Now, sweetie, that was very good!

181
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,679
 But Auntie Bridget thinks
 you should stretch more like this!

182
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 Would you like a cup of tea?

183
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,958
 Hi, Nick!

184
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,959
 This is Joe. He was just telling me
 about window cleaning.

185
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,719
 So I see!

186
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,280
 So, you want my girlfriend, do you?

187
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
 Thanks, Lucas!

188
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,438
 Nick, Joe, stop!

189
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,439
 No! He started it!

190
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,239
 Nick, what are you doing?

191
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,439
 Electric shocks!

192
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,519
 Check!

193
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 How do you do that?

194
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,599
 Poor Joe!

195
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
 I haven't paid him! Joe!

196
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,680
 Has Bridget just run off
 with the window cleaner?

197
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,318
 Yep!

198
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,319
 Cuckoo! Anybody home?

199
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,039
 Lucas, my darling, I'm back!
 Give your mummy a hug!

200
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,078
 -  How was George?
 -  Wonderful!

201
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,079
 So, did you tell George about, you know?

202
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,638
 You know?

203
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,759
 What?

204
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 Did you tell George Ducas about me?

205
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,639
 What a good actor I am.

206
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,678
 I'm so sorry, darling.

207
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,598
 I completely forgot!

208
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,599
 It was all so exciting!

209
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,399
 Lucas, you're going to have a new daddy!

210
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,078
 George and I are going to be married.

211
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,079
 I'm going to be Mrs George Ducas.

212
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
 Hey! That means
 you are going to be Lucas Ducas!

213
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,360
 Lucas, come with me
 and meet your new daddy.

214
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,480
 See? Girls are yuck!

215
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,959
 Next time in Extra...

216
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,039
 Bridget gets a new computer,

217
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,039
 the boys get competitive,

218
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 and Annie gets a surprise.

219
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,519
 and Annie gets a surprise.
