1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,490
I want to dye my hair green

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,660
many of my friends have dyed their hair
different colors

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,100
I don't mean normal hair colors like
brown or black

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,810
my friends have dyed their hair orange
purple and blue

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,950
I told my mother that I would like to
dye my hair green

6
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,340
I explain to my mother that I would only
use food coloring the green would not

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,989
last forever

8
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,700
my mother said that dying your hair was
a silly fad

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,120
she said that I would not look good with
green hair

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,480
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair
green

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:51,400
maybe I could get a nose ring my mother
said no I said that maybe a tattoo on my

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,660
arm would be nice

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,110
my mother said no way my mother said
that she did some crazy things when she

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,180
was a young girl she said that she used
to iron her hair to make it straight

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,840
that sounds quite boring to me my friend
Joan came over her hair is dyed bright

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,770
pink

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,320
my father said nice hair Joan I don't
think that he really meant it

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,429
my mother says that when I am an adult I
can dye my hair

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,320
whatever crazy color I like but for now
she would like me to leave my hair its

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
natural color

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,60
I tried to tell her that all my friends
were doing it

22
00:01:31,60 --> 00:01:36,549
my mother asked if all your friends were
jumping off a cliff would you do it - I

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,560
said no I think I'll have to wait to
have green hair but maybe by the time

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,80
i'm old enough to dye my hair green

25
00:01:44,80 --> 00:01:48,640
I won't want it that color my mother
says that fads change all the time

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,229
one day something might be popular and
the next day it's not in style at all

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,49
I'll just have to live without green
hair for now I wonder what the Fed will

28
00:01:59,49 --> 00:02:02,49
be next month

29
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,620
why do people dislike other people

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,780
some people don't like other people just
because they look different

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,690
I think that is silly I don't think that
it is fair to judge someone by the way

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,650
they look

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,400
some people look very nice but they are
mean or cruel

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
some people look very ordinary but they
are incredibly nice

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,980
I remember when I was in grade one I saw
a girl across the room she had a mean

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,239
look on her face

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,50
I thought to myself that she was
probably not a very nice person

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,270
I stayed away from her and played with
the other children then we had to play a

39
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,230
game and the teacher said that she would
pick partners for us

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,738
the teacher picked the girl with the
mean face as my partner

41
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,820
I didn't think that the game would be
much fun at all with a partner who

42
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,859
seemed as mean as that girl

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,690
I walked up to her and said hello the
girl's face changed

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,989
she smiled at me and she began to talk
to me

45
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,190
hermine face disappeared we had lots of
fun playing the game

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,900
we laughed a lot and enjoyed each
other's company that girl became my best

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,890
friend

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,40
now when I look at her I see what is
inside her

49
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,530
sometimes she doesn't smile but I know
what she is like she is a kind and funny

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,430
person

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,459
I have learned that you can't judge a
book by it's cover

52
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,739
it is not fair to dislike someone just
because they don't look like you want

53
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,160
them to look you have to get to know a
person

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,79
it doesn't matter to me what color a
person's skin is it doesn't matter to me

55
00:03:56,79 --> 00:04:01,30
if they are short or tall skinny or fat
or happy or sad looking

56
00:04:01,30 --> 00:04:06,310
I judge people by how they treat me and
I try to treat people like I would want

57
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,310
to be treated

58
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,180
the birthday gift

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,930
it is going to be my father's birthday
what can I give him

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,910
I don't have much money i have looked
all through the stores and i have not

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,570
found anything that I think he would
like or that i can afford

62
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,800
I have thought very hard about what to
buy for him

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,810
I thought that he might like some candy
but my father really doesn't eat many

64
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,740
sweets

65
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,910
I thought that he might like a new shirt
but he has lots of clothes

66
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,630
I can't afford a new car or computer for
him

67
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,30
I was watching him on the weekend he cut
the grass wash the car took out the

68
00:04:58,30 --> 00:04:58,809
garbage

69
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,139
we did the garden and water the plants I
got an idea

70
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,550
I went to my room and took out some
paper

71
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,000
I cut out pieces of paper and I wrote on
them

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
I wrote on one piece of paper that i
would wash the car every weekend for the

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,250
summer

74
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,810
I wrote on another piece that I would
take out the garbage every week for the

75
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,710
summer

76
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,900
i also wrote that I would cut the grass
weed the garden and water the plants

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,940
every week for the summer

78
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,550
I made a birthday card for my dad and I
put the pieces of paper inside it

79
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,800
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my
dad my dad thought that the gift was

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
very thoughtful

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,610
he said that it was a gift from the
heart I did all those things for my dad

82
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,510
all summer

83
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,770
he said that he had a lot of free time
because I helped him so much

84
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,780
my dad and I are good friends I don't
mind doing things for him because I know

85
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,270
that he is always there to help me out a
good gift doesn't have to be something

86
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,250
that costs a lot

87
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,320
my dad says that the best gifts are the
ones that show how much you care for the

88
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,430
other person

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,430
I'm glad my dad liked his gift

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,80
New Year's Day

91
00:06:28,80 --> 00:06:31,560
on New Year's Day people start a new
year

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,909
many people make resolutions they
resolved to be better people

93
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,818
some people decide that they will lose
weight so that they can be healthier

94
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,849
some people decide to give up smoking

95
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,310
they also want to be healthier there are
all kinds of resolutions that people

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,629
make some people try not to lose their
tempers

97
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,370
some people say that they will work
harder there are people who try to give

98
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,780
up bad habits

99
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,378
every year my brother says that he will
stop biting his nails

100
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:10,620
he stops biting his nails in January but
my februari he always starts again

101
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,289
that is the thing about New Year's
resolutions people seldom keep them

102
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,940
everybody starts out with good
intentions but it is very hard to stick

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,840
with them

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,219
I don't make new year's resolutions I
find that I just break them

105
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,29
I just work day by day to break my bad
habits

106
00:07:30,29 --> 00:07:34,620
I know that they eat too many sweets
every day I just try to resist them

107
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,279
I think that every day is a new day

108
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,900
regardless of whether it is New Year's
Day or not bad habits are hard to break

109
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,469
the best thing is never to start any bad
habits

110
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,419
I don't know if my brother will ever
stop biting his nails but I know that

111
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,210
each January he intends to stop

112
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,960
maybe one of these new years days he'll
get over that habit

113
00:08:06,60 --> 00:08:09,270
if I could fly

114
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,960
I sometimes imagine what it would be
like if I could fly like a bird

115
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,450
just imagine what it would be like to
soar into the sky flying high above the

116
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,950
trees you could stand on high rooftops
and never be afraid of falling

117
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,719
you would see so many things as you flew
over rooftops and forests you would feel

118
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,190
incredibly free as you traveled from
place to place not bothered by road

119
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,410
signs or traffic jams

120
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,589
if I could fly like a bird I would start
from my backyard and travel through town

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,540
I would look down on the houses and
factories when I got tired i would land

122
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,819
in a field and take a nap

123
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,410
I would travel above rivers and follow
them as they wound along and emptied

124
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,209
into lakes and oceans

125
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,920
I would fly above parks and i would call
out to the children as I flew high above

126
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,910
them

127
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,880
I would dip and dive as I flew I would
soar up high and dive down low so that I

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,910
could almost touch the tree tops

129
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,709
have you ever flown I know that you
can't fly like a bird but you might have

130
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,990
taken an airplane ride when you're in an
airplane you pass through clouds

131
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,60
it is exciting to take an airplane ride
I love taking airplane flights

132
00:09:24,60 --> 00:09:27,810
I like to look down at the earth when
you're up that high

133
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,489
everything below you looks tiny that's
the closest i'll get to flying like a

134
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,980
bird but i can still use my imagination
and spread my wings and soar high above

135
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,980
the world just like a bird

136
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,570
what I look for in a friend

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,850
what is it that makes somebody your
friend some people are nice and you have

138
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,900
fun with them

139
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,579
some people are nice to talk to but they
don't become special to you

140
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,800
some people become very close to you
those people are the ones who become

141
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,780
your good friends

142
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,939
did you ever wonder why certain people
do become your good friends friends

143
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,130
usually have something in common

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,850
often friends enjoy doing the same
things as each other

145
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,800
maybe they like the same sports or the
same music or maybe they can even talk

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,170
about problems or schoolwork friends
usually find a common bond

147
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,969
friends share ideas and listen to each
other sometimes people who don't have

148
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,790
similar interests even become friends

149
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,839
you can learn a lot from a person who
likes different things than you

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,740
the most important thing about friends
is that they must communicate with each

151
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,520
other

152
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,800
a good friend is a person who takes the
time to listen to the other person one

153
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,790
of the most important things that i
think a friend should have is a sense of

154
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,819
humor I like to laugh with my friends

155
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,530
I like to feel comfortable around my
friends it is nice to be able to talk

156
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,560
and laugh with people who have similar
interests

157
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,790
it is nice to share things with people
and learn about their interests you

158
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,810
become a better person if you are able
to learn things from others

159
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,810
life is a journey on that journey you
meet many people some of those people

160
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,589
will change your life you have to choose
your friends with care

161
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,670
a good friend is worth more than all the
gold in the world

162
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,310
a good friend will make your journey
through life more pleasant make friends

163
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,550
along the way and the path through life
will be very rewarding

164
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
a funny thing happened on the way to
school

165
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,280
last Friday it was very windy I was
walking down the street with my friend

166
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,380
John we were having a difficult time
walking against the wind the wind was

167
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,490
pushing against us and we felt the force
of it pressing against us

168
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,640
we even had a hard time breathing we
were walking slowly we watch the leaves

169
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,40
as they danced and twirled in the wind

170
00:12:16,40 --> 00:12:21,260
we watched a plastic bag as it flew by
us we saw a little boy whose baseball

171
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,600
cap flew right off his head his cap flew
along the sidewalk and he had to chase

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,260
it

173
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,460
he finally caught it and he held it in
his hands tightly after he got it back

174
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,460
the trees were swaying frantically their
branches swished and waved in the wild

175
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,270
wind

176
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,829
John and I were hit by flying bits of
paper and leaves

177
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,660
we laughed when a garbage can lid rolled
along and hit John in the leg

178
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,699
we saw another garbage can rolling along
the road as if it was alive

179
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,219
everything was moving because of the
wind then the funniest thing happened

180
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,770
I wasn't paying any attention and a
paper bag came flying up the street

181
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,000
toward us

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,780
it hit me right in the face and covered
my whole face

183
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,70
at first I didn't know what had happened
I was blinded

184
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,650
I couldn't see where I was going I
stopped and held out my hands when I

185
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,439
stopped the bag fell off my face

186
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I looked at John he was laughing very
hard

187
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,910
he was laughing so hard that tears were
rolling down his cheeks

188
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,69
he said that I looked very funny with
the brown paper bag stuck to my face

189
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,449
I started to laugh - we laughed about it
all the way to school

190
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,199
John said that he wished he had a camera

191
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,410
he would have taken a picture of me with
a bag on my face

192
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,579
advice

193
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
sometimes my mother gives me advice

194
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,820
she tells me to save my money for a
rainy day

195
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,410
she says that I should eat my vegetables
if I want to be strong when I grow up

196
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,20
she says that you reap what you sow I
didn't know what that one meant so i

197
00:14:16,20 --> 00:14:21,660
asked her she said that if you are good
to people they will be good to you if

198
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,930
you do bad things and bad things will
come back to you

199
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,420
my mother is always giving me advice she
says that a penny saved is a penny

200
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,410
earned

201
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,490
I am still thinking about that one some
of these things are difficult to

202
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,610
understand my mother is very wise

203
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
she says that she has learned from her
mistakes

204
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,740
she tells me that she would like me not
to make mistakes but she says that

205
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,170
everyone does make mistakes

206
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,170
the important thing is that we learn
from our mistakes

207
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,980
my mother says that nobody is perfect

208
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,980
my mother tells my sister that time is
precious

209
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,210
my sister wastes time and my mother
doesn't like that

210
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,450
my mother tells me to be true to myself

211
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,600
she says that I should not follow the
crowd

212
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,140
I should listen to my own conscience and
do what I think is right

213
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,880
she says that it doesn't matter if you
fail at something the important thing is

214
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,870
that you try if you've done your best
then that is all that matters

215
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,489
I listened to my mother I think she
gives very good advice

216
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,580
my mother has a lot of common sense i
hope i am as wise as she is

217
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,560
when I have children of my own sometimes
I wish that she would not give me so

218
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,729
much advice

219
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,500
I think that I know what I'm doing but
in the end i always remember what she

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,420
has said and I try to live by the
standards that she has set for me take

221
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,490
the advice that your parents give you

222
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,490
they only have your best interests at
heart

223
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,950
a trip to the hospital

224
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,750
I have to get my tonsils out I'm not
really happy about it but I'm tired of

225
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,270
being sick and having sore throats

226
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,890
I have to go to the hospital two hours
before my surgery my mother will go with

227
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,640
me

228
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
the nurses will take my temperature and
check my blood pressure

229
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,270
they will make sure that i am ready for
my operation

230
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,430
I will be dressed in a white gown and i
will be wheeled down the hall to the

231
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,750
operating room

232
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,880
I can't have anything to eat or drink
for a long time before my surgery my

233
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,530
mother will walk down the hall with me
then she will wave goodbye as they will

234
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,850
me into the operating room the doctor
and the nurses will be busy in the

235
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,930
operating room

236
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,239
they will be getting ready to perform my
surgery the doctor will say hello to me

237
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,570
and tell me that he is going to put me
to sleep

238
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,310
he will put something into my arm he
will tell me to count backwards from ten

239
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,109
I think that I will only say ten nine
and then i will be fast asleep

240
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,79
I won't be awake for the surgery when I
wake up I will be surprised that the

241
00:17:14,79 --> 00:17:18,369
surgery is over my throat will hurt and
i probably won't feel very good

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,79
my mother will be there with me the
nurses will give me a drink and try to

243
00:17:23,79 --> 00:17:24,430
make me comfortable

244
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,100
I won't be in the hospital overnight I
will go home later in the day my parents

245
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,129
will have to make sure that i have a lot
to drink

246
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,580
I can't eat any hard foods or they will
hurt my throat

247
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,600
I will sleep a lot because I will not
feel very well for a couple of days

248
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,260
it won't take long before I recover from
my surgery

249
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,60
sometimes we need surgery to make us
feel better hospitals can be a bit

250
00:17:49,60 --> 00:17:53,770
frightening but the doctors and nurses
are very nice and their job is to make

251
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,770
you better

252
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,658
what my cat did

253
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,19
one day I was sitting in a chair
drinking a cup of tea

254
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:21,840
my cat came into the room and sat on my
lap she was quite content and she SAT

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,299
there purring my cat likes to drink
water and sometimes she drinks milk

256
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,158
I would never give her tea to drink cats
just don't drink tea

257
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,919
we were sitting there quietly when
suddenly my cat stood up she was looking

258
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,749
at something on the floor

259
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:43,200
she crouched down low and got ready to
pounce

260
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,39
I saw what she was looking at it was a
huge centipede

261
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:52,919
I think that centipedes are ugly they
have many legs and they move very fast

262
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,129
I would hate to have one crawl over me
my cat jump to the floor and she ran

263
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,689
over to the centipede

264
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,609
she was incredibly fast I was surprised
that she caught the centipede

265
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:11,369
she put her paw on it and then she
reached down and ate the centipede the

266
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:14,428
centipede must not have tasted very good

267
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,299
my cat got a funny look on her face and
she looked like she was trying to get a

268
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,668
bad taste out of her mouth

269
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:26,340
I was thinking that I would be sick if I
ate a centipede my cat looked at B and

270
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,289
jump back up in my chair

271
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,99
she stuck her face in my teacup and took
a big drink of tea

272
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,570
I was shocked i had never seen a cat
drink tea before I think that the

273
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,249
centipede must have tasted so bad that
my cat just needed something to wash the

274
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,320
taste out of her mouth

275
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,830
guess what I didn't finish my tea

276
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,949
I threw it out and washed out the cup my
cat has never had a drink of tea since

277
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,559
that day she has also never eaten
another centipede if a centipede walks

278
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,590
by she just pretends that she doesn't
see it

279
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,300
if I was tiny

280
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,780
imagine what life would be like if you
were two inches tall

281
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,760
you would have to be careful that nobody
stepped on you you would have to watch

282
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,610
out for cats dogs and birds

283
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,570
it would be very dangerous but just
think of the things that you could do

284
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,810
you could live in a dollhouse or even a
shoebox

285
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
you could use a bottle cap for a plate

286
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,600
you would have to wear dolls clothes a
stamp would make a lovely picture to

287
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
hang on your wall

288
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
you could hide in a Mousehole or a
drawer

289
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,330
you wouldn't need much food you could
probably live comfortably on the crumbs

290
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,30
that people would leave on the table a
thimble would make a good cup if you

291
00:21:06,30 --> 00:21:10,350
went outside the grass would seem like a
jungle an insect would be huge and

292
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,980
frightening a puddle would seem to be an
ocean

293
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,710
you could cross the puddle in a paper
cup and use a spoon for or a matchbox

294
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,120
would make a good bed with a
handkerchief as a bedspread you brush

295
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,840
your hair with a toothbrush but you'd
never find anything small enough to

296
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,340
brush your teeth with you could take a
ride on the back of a mouse

297
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,510
you wouldn't find any books that were
small enough to read but you might read

298
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,310
the back of a pill bottle

299
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:44,250
you could ride in a toy car and have a
super ball for a swimming pool a leaf

300
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,960
could be your umbrella and a mitten
would make a great sleeping bag if you

301
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,340
use your imagination

302
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,550
you could think of something to use for
almost all your purposes

303
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,840
being small might be fun but then again
it would be frightening

304
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,520
I'd be afraid of my pet cat I wouldn't
want a book to fall on me I would be

305
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,879
afraid of being swept away by a big gust
of wind

306
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I think I'd rather be my size

307
00:22:19,10 --> 00:22:22,10
do people have the right to smoke in
public

308
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,330
my father used to small

309
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,330
he got very ill

310
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,350
the doctor told him that he had to quit
smoking

311
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,760
my father tried for a long time to quit

312
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,730
it was very difficult for him smoking is
an addiction

313
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,840
after many months

314
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,300
my father finally gave up smoking but he
still craved a cigarette once in a while

315
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,460
he says that quitting smoking is the
hardest thing that he has ever done

316
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,629
when my father did smoke he smoked
everywhere

317
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,510
he smoked in restaurants stores and many
public buildings

318
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,820
now you are not allowed to smoke in a
lot of public places

319
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:22,730
when my father smoked the rules were not
so strict people could smoke just about

320
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,900
anywhere

321
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:31,309
it really wasn't fair to the people who
didn't smoke their clothes always

322
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,580
smelled like smoke and they breathe in
secondhand smoke some people think that

323
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,970
the second hand smoke is actually worse
for you than if you smoke yourself

324
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,280
people with smoke in their houses and
very young children would inhale the

325
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,260
smoke that was in the air

326
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,120
some people still smoke in their houses
and their children breathe in the smoke

327
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,70
some restaurants have areas for smokers
and non-smokers

328
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,149
but usually the smoke drifts from one
area to the other

329
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,590
there are some businesses that have been
smoking altogether

330
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,789
personally I think that smoking in
public places should be completely

331
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,919
banned

332
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,940
I don't think that I should have to
breathe in another person smoke if I

333
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,970
choose not to smoke myself it wouldn't
be fair for a nonsmoker to get lung

334
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,169
cancer because they had to be in a place
where smokers were allowed to light up

335
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,620
I know that smoking is a powerful
addiction and that it is very difficult

336
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,178
to quit but smokers should restrict
their smoking to places where there is

337
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,570
nobody else around

338
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,570
lung cancer is an awful disease

339
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,320
nobody should have to suffer with monk
answer people should be educated about

340
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,460
the dangers of smoking smoking should be
banned in public places but eventually I

341
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,519
would like to believe that fewer people
will smoke it would be nice to live in a

342
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,519
smoke-free environment

343
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,169
if I were a giant

344
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,909
if I were a giant I wouldn't be able to
fit in my house I'd have to live in a

345
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,749
building that had a high ceiling but i
probably have a hard time getting

346
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,859
through the door

347
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,789
I'd have to make my own clothes but
where would I get a giant needle and

348
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:45,59
thread to sew with I couldn't ride in a
car or a plane

349
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,499
I suppose I would just have to take
giant steps to get from place to place

350
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,238
I would have to be very careful not to
step on anybody or anything

351
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,840
when I talked people would cover their
ears my voice would sound very loud to

352
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,408
them I wouldn't find the shoes to cover
my feet

353
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,909
I wouldn't find a knife and fork to eat
my dinner with I might have to use a

354
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,499
rake as a fork

355
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:14,39
my dinner would be huge what would I
cook my dinner in

356
00:26:14,39 --> 00:26:19,289
I certainly wouldn't find an oven big
enough to put my dinner and if I sneezed

357
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,90
it would be like a hurricane

358
00:26:21,90 --> 00:26:24,418
if I fell down it would be like an
earthquake

359
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,230
I wouldn't have any friends because
everyone would be too tiny for me to

360
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,159
talk to

361
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,279
I think that being a giant would be very
lonely

362
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,749
I couldn't have just one Apple I would
have to have a lot of apples to fill me

363
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:37,379
up

364
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:40,379
I would have to drink gallons and
gallons of water to quench my thirst

365
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,359
I could never relax under a tree I would
be taller than all the trees

366
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,418
I don't think that being a giant would
be fun

367
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,100
I won't ever make a wish to be a giant i
would rather be my height

368
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm very happy the way I am yeah

369
00:27:06,60 --> 00:27:09,60
superstitions

370
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,270
I am NOT superstitious are you yesterday
was Friday the 13th

371
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:25,330
some people think that friday the 13 is
an unlucky day I think that it is just

372
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,679
like any other day

373
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,980
some people believe that if a black cat
crosses your path you will have bad luck

374
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,630
I don't believe that either

375
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,560
my mother always gets upset if i open an
umbrella in the house

376
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,790
she says that is bad luck she is
probably right about that one because an

377
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,780
open umbrella would take up a lot of
space and you might not things over

378
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,940
if your left hand is itchy you are
supposed to get money i have had an

379
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,110
energy left hand before but I haven't
received any money because of it

380
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:13,100
it is bad like to walk under a ladder
that is probably true because you might

381
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,639
knock somebody off the ladder or have a
can of paint fall on top of you

382
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,470
if you are acting in a play it is bad
luck if someone says good luck to you

383
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,330
this is very confusing you were supposed
to tell an actor to break a leg

384
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
it doesn't mean that you want the actor
to break his leg

385
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,310
it means good luck to the actor actors
have a lot of superstitions that are

386
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,550
very unusual

387
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:50,639
I am NOT superstitious I don't believe
in superstitions at all

388
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,690
it is just fun to learn about
superstitions

389
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,420
some of them are very old and have been
passed down from generation to

390
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,550
generation

391
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,669
I once did a project at school on
superstitions

392
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,200
it was a very interesting topic and they
got a good mark for it

393
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
my favorite bedtime story

394
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,559
every night when I was little my mother
would read me a bedtime story

395
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,270
my favorite story was Tom's midnight
garden

396
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,970
this was a story by Filipa pierce it was
quite a long book and it took quite a

397
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:51,230
few nights for my mother to read the
entire book to me in Toms midnight

398
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,920
garden

399
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,460
Tom moves to the city to stay with his
aunt and uncle he is very bored at their

400
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,570
apartment

401
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,919
they have no children so tom has nothing
to do

402
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,800
one night the clock strikes 13 times

403
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
tom knows that this is impossible

404
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,940
a clock can only strike up to 12 times
he sneaks downstairs and goes outside

405
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,119
when he goes outside there is a
wonderful garden

406
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,119
that wasn't there the day before

407
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:35,480
the next day Tom goes outside and finds
there is no garden the garden only seems

408
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,929
to appear at night every night

409
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:43,190
Tom slips out to this wonderful garden
and meet some people in the garden

410
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:51,110
he meets a girl named caddy happy and
Tom become very good friends in this

411
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,110
garden

412
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,370
some very strange things happen in this
book

413
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,10
there are some coincidences that keep
you guessing about what is really going

414
00:31:03,10 --> 00:31:06,520
on the surprise ending is wonderful

415
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,910
I really enjoyed Tom's midnight garden
and I was very sad when my mother and I

416
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,830
came to the end of the book

417
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,490
I felt that I had visited the magical
garden with tom

418
00:31:19,30 --> 00:31:22,30
it is a book that i will remember all my
life

419
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
if I found a magic lamp

420
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,270
if I was walking down the beach one day
and I happened to bump my toe on a magic

421
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,990
lamp

422
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:50,409
I would pick it up and rub it if it was
a real magic lamp

423
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,880
but i don't believe that there really is
a magic lamp a genie would pop out in a

424
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
cloud of smoke and he would call me
master

425
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,230
he would say that he would grant me
three wishes

426
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:08,379
I would have to think very hard about
those wishes because I wouldn't want to

427
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,490
waste them

428
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,659
I don't think I'd want millions of
dollars

429
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:18,70
money doesn't buy happiness or so they
say

430
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,760
I might wish for good health

431
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,899
because if your health isn't good you
won't be able to enjoy anything

432
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,929
some people might wish for beauty but
beauty is only skin deep

433
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,959
some people would wish for a mansion or
a beautiful car or a big boat

434
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,580
I don't want any of those things some
people would want Fame

435
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,419
some people would want talent

436
00:32:51,80 --> 00:32:58,340
some people would wish for happiness
that might be a good thing to wish for

437
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,000
yes maybe I'd wish for health and
happiness

438
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,690
but what would my third wish be I could
wish for something enormous something

439
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,200
global I could wish for world peace

440
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,270
that would be a wonderful thing if
somebody could grant me that

441
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,650
yes that would probably be my third wish

442
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,960
it's too bad there aren't any genies
inside magic lamps

443
00:33:28,10 --> 00:33:31,160
I won't get my three wishes

444
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,120
I can still work toward getting my
wishes

445
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,830
I can eat well and exercise to stay
healthy

446
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,949
I can be involved with a lot of things
and be with my friends to stay happy

447
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,860
I can volunteer my time two different
organizations to help achieve world

448
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,260
peace

449
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,379
I can do my fair share in my community
to help others

450
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,409
that's how i can get my three wishes not
through a magic lamp

451
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,610
I can only get what I want through self
determination and hard work that is the

452
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,610
key to getting your wishes fulfilled

453
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:25,418
help

454
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,859
did you ever have to call for help

455
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,859
were you ever in a situation that was an
emergency

456
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,509
it is good to know what to do in case of
an emergency

457
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:42,488
you should always know how to get in
touch with the police and fire

458
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,629
departments

459
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,538
i have read stories were very young boys
or girls have called the police and

460
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,829
saved their friends or family members
lives because they knew just who to get

461
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,260
a hold of

462
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,380
if you see a fire you should call the
fire department

463
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,410
a lot of tragedies have been prevented
because the calls have been made quickly

464
00:35:08,30 --> 00:35:11,570
it is important than emergency vehicles
arrived very quickly

465
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:20,150
that is why those vehicles have sirens
when their sirens go

466
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,480
it means to get out of the way

467
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,490
policemen firemen and ambulance
attendants are trained to handle very

468
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:36,770
difficult situations they often save
people's lives they go through a lot of

469
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,290
training to become good at what they do

470
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,380
they never panic in emergencies

471
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,29
for your part you should keep emergency
numbers near the phone or know what the

472
00:35:49,30 --> 00:35:51,470
emergency numbers are

473
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,490
where I live there is a special number
that you call for any emergency

474
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,950
we teach that number to everyone even
very tiny children

475
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,299
it is important to remain calm if you
need help

476
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,410
if you call an emergency number

477
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,700
you have to be able to speak clearly and
tell the person you are talking to

478
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,950
exactly what the problem is

479
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,868
I hope you are never in an emergency
situation but it is a good idea to be

480
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,869
prepared

481
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,149
the peach orchard

482
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,50
when I was very young I lived in erie
peach orchard

483
00:36:43,50 --> 00:36:46,980
now there is a park where the orchard
used to be

484
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,70
I always remember the peach orchard
because my grandmother and I used to go

485
00:36:53,70 --> 00:36:56,310
there and pick peaches

486
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,310
the owner of the orchard would let all
the neighbors pick peaches

487
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,730
it's not the fact that I used to get
many ripe tasty peaches that I remember

488
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,650
it's the time that I used to spend with
my grandmother that I remember my

489
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,770
grandmother was very old but she was
very healthy

490
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,970
she used to walk a lot i think that is
what kept her fit

491
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,750
she had a lot of energy so she like to
go to a lot of places

492
00:37:27,30 --> 00:37:31,470
she would get a fruit basket and then
she would ask me if I wanted to go to

493
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,399
the orchard

494
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,650
I always said yes because I enjoyed
walking through the orchard on a sunny

495
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,340
day

496
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,240
we never climbed up on a ladder to reach
the peaches

497
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,490
we just reached for the low hanging
fruit my grandmother and I used to talk

498
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,439
all the time that we were out there

499
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,910
it was nice to spend time with her

500
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,390
she told me many stories about when she
was a young girl

501
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,390
we laughed and got to know each other
better

502
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
my grandmother only visited us during
the summer

503
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,370
she lived in california and i lived in
Niagara Falls

504
00:38:08,60 --> 00:38:11,60
so we didn't get to spend a lot of time
with each other

505
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,900
we enjoyed the hot summer days in the
orchard

506
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,689
you could smell the peaches and the bees
buzz lazily bias

507
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,210
my grandmother would point out different
insects and birds to me

508
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,210
I learned a lot about nature from her

509
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,430
we would end up with a big basket of
peaches

510
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,609
when we got home my mother would wash
the peaches and often she would bake a

511
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,770
peach pie for us

512
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,750
nobody bakes the peach pie like my
mother it's good to have memories like

513
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:53,660
that childhood memories of time spent
with my grandmother are very precious to

514
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:00,259
me sometimes is just the simple things
that you do in life that leave you with

515
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
the nicest memories

516
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,379
learning to dance

517
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,539
I went to England with my mother she
used to be a singer in a band

518
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:33,269
we went to the hotel that she used to
sing at it was a big fancy hotel

519
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:38,98
some of the people that she knew when
she saying in the band were still there

520
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:44,430
they remembered my mother and they had a
good time talking to her and remembering

521
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,690
old times

522
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,799
many people told me that I looked like
my mother

523
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,480
in the hotel they had a fancy hall where
they had ballroom dancing

524
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,20
i am not used to that kind of dancing

525
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,620
I always danced to rock music

526
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,780
a man told me that he would teach me how
to dance

527
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:16,520
it looked very easy i held one of his
hands and put my other hand on his

528
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,740
shoulder

529
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,740
he told me exactly how to move my feet

530
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I was very clumsy and I stepped on his
toes

531
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,90
he was patient with me and he counted
one two three

532
00:40:32,90 --> 00:40:40,70
I tried to waltz with him i would start
out pretty well but then i would get

533
00:40:40,70 --> 00:40:42,680
mixed up and stand on his toes again

534
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,390
the man laughed about it I told him that
I wasn't a very good dancer but he said

535
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,220
that I was good for a beginner

536
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,368
I think he was just being polite

537
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,170
the man asked my mother to dance my
mother is a very good dancer

538
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,160
I didn't know that about her

539
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,330
she never stepped on the man's toes once
the man thanks for Dancing with him and

540
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,330
I thank him for giving me dancing
lessons

541
00:41:18,70 --> 00:41:21,280
I don't think i'll ever be very good at
that type of dancing

542
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,480
each generation has a specific type of
dancing

543
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:32,830
the way that I dance is different from
the way that my mother dances the way

544
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,40
that I dance doesn't involve moving your
feet too much

545
00:41:36,40 --> 00:41:39,40
I'm not too good at fancy steps

546
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,590
superheroes

547
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,750
when my brother was very young he loved
superheroes

548
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,269
he could

549
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:06,269
the plastic figures of all the
superheroes

550
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:14,39
I think he had every superhero figurine
that there was he used to tie a towel

551
00:42:14,39 --> 00:42:16,709
over his shoulders and run through the
backyard

552
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:20,98
he pretended that he was rescuing people

553
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:27,179
one time he stood on the roof he really
thought that he could fly with this

554
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,829
superhero cape on

555
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:35,249
he would have hurt himself if he had
jumped my dad saw him and told him to

556
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:39,299
get down my dad explained to my brother

557
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:44,999
the superheroes are not real real people
cannot fly from rooftops

558
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:51,989
my brother was disappointed he thought
that the superheroes really existed

559
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,950
my dad explained that most superheroes
were created as comic book characters

560
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,649
somebody used their imagination to make
them up and then an artist through them

561
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:10,249
my brother was not impressed he said
that he wanted to meet the superheroes

562
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,339
my father told him that he might meet
someone dressed up as a superhero but it

563
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,69
wouldn't really be a superhero in the
classroom

564
00:43:19,69 --> 00:43:23,269
it is hard to explain two small children
that the things that they see in comic

565
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,269
books and on television aren't really
real

566
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,799
my brothers still pretty

567
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,500
he is a superhero he doesn't jump from
rooftops but he runs around and makes

568
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,230
noises like he is flying

569
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,290
I look at him and remember when I used
to do things like that

570
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,649
I'm more mature than my brother I know
that superheroes aren't real but I know

571
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,50
that he is having fun and using his
imagination
