to play with a bird or fish

190
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,790

I am special nobody in the world is
exactly like I am

443
00:34:26,20 --> 00:34:31,329
they might have the same hair color and
eyes that I do but they are not exactly

444
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,169
like me

445
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:36,908
I am the only person in the world who
thinks my thoughts

446
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,000
no two people in the world are exactly
alike

447
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:47,500
it is good to be your own person it is
good to be creative and be natural

448
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,710
people have to follow the laws and the
rules

449
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,339
people should always be kind to others

450
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,440
I try to follow all the rules I am kind
to others

451
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,369
I am a lot like many other people yet I
am different i am like my friend Jane

452
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:13,900
but she has red hair and i have dark
hair she has a loud voice and i have a

453
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,859
soft voice

454
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,980
she likes to eat vegetables and I do not

455
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,150
Jane and I are the same height we both
like movies and we are both afraid of

456
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,20
spiders

457
00:35:26,20 --> 00:35:31,630
we wear the same size shoes and we both
have the same favorite color

458
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:38,500
we are best friends but sometimes we
disagree about things we are alike in

459
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:46,29
many ways and different in many ways if
we were all exactly the same the world

460
00:35:46,29 --> 00:35:48,549
would be a very boring place

461
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:53,349
I am myself and i am glad that I'm
special

462
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:59,950
you are special to use your own special
talents and take the time to meet other

463
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,910
people

464
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,190
the world is made up of a lot of
different people and that's what makes

465
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,190
life exciting

466
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
my cat

467
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,610
I got my cat when she was just a tiny
kitten

468
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,840
I named her puff because her fur is soft
and fluffy

469
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,560
she has white fur butter tail

470
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,9

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,759

washes her face with her paw paw

473
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,160

purrs whenever we pet her she is very

476
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,850
playful

477
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,770
we sometimes roll out the piece of paper
and throw it to her she loves to chase

478
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,350
the paper and hit it with her paws

479
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,380
she also chases bugs last night she
chased a spider but she was afraid to

480
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,610
touch it at night she curls up in my bed
with me

481
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,50
she likes to be warm I have given her a
blanket of her own

482
00:37:30,50 --> 00:37:35,240
but when i put her on it her tail
twitches her tail twitches whenever

483
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,370
she's upset or angry

484
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,670
I know she doesn't want to be on her
blanket

485
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,710
she wants to be in my bed I let her into
my bed and she falls asleep

486
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,550
purring loudly

487
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,119

00:39:01,9 --> 00:39:06,259
she likes to play classical music but
sometimes i get her to play rock music

503
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:07,309
with me

504
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:10,549
she is also a very good singer

505
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,999
I like to sing with her we sing and
harmony

506
00:39:15,19 --> 00:39:18,49
I listen to music all the time on the
radio

507
00:39:18,49 --> 00:39:23,329
I know a lot of songs I can sing along
with most of the songs that come on the

508
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,230
radio

509
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:30,140
i memorize the lyrics of the songs my
sister and I sometimes get together and

510
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,390
sing our favorite songs

511
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,578
maybe someday we will start our own rock
band and i will be the drummer

512
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,330
spring

513
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:58,240
it rains a lot in the spring the trees
are full of buds and the flowers are

514
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,629
starting to bloom my favorite spring
flowers are tulips and daffodils the

515
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,490
birds come back from the south

516
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,859
I can always tell that spring is here
when I see my first Robin of the season

517
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,780
the Robins pull worms from the wet
ground when it isn't raining

518
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,410
my friends and I go outside and toss a
ball around

519
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,50
we look forward to the summer but we are
glad to get outside after the long

520
00:40:26,50 --> 00:40:26,950
winter

521
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,950
the air smells so fresh in the spring

522
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,939
my mother always tells me not to track
mud into the house

523
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,720
it's very muddy in our yard in the
springtime

524
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,410
I wipe my muddy feet before i go into
the house

525
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,529
there are a lot of puddles in my yard

526
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:49,900
I sometimes splash in the puddles and I
get wet and cold so i have to go into

527
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,740
the house

528
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,350
I like it when the snow has melted the
rain has stopped and the sun comes out

529
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,540
on sunny days

530
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,360
I always get together with my friends on
those days we either ride our bikes or

531
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,350
play ball

532
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,660
my parents like to go for walks on
spring evenings they also like to clean

533
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,339
up the yard in the spring

534
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:18,70
everyone seems to be outside the
springtime brings people out of their

535
00:41:18,70 --> 00:41:21,70
houses

536
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,29
the birthday party

537
00:41:29,29 --> 00:41:32,59
yesterday I went to a birthday party

538
00:41:32,59 --> 00:41:32,859
my friend

539
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:38,529
Jane had her 10th birthday her house was
decorated with balloons and streamers

540
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,930
her mother had baked a big birthday cake
the cake had

541
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,640
happy 10th birthday Jane written on it
there were ten candles on the cake

542
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:52,569
Jane blew out the candles and make a
wish

543
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:58,299
I wonder what she wished for your wish
won't come true if you tell anyone what

544
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:03,489
it was we saying happy birthday to you
at the party

545
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:08,109
we played some games i won one of the
games so I got a prize

546
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,710
we also swam in Jane swimming pool

547
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,180
Jane opened her gifts her gifts were
wrapped in bright paper and bows

548
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:22,779
she got lots of nice gifts she got some
compact discs some clothes and some

549
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:24,130

Jane thanks everyone we ate a lot of
food at Jane's party we had hot dogs

551
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:33,819
I put mustard and ketchup on my hot dog

552
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,930
then we ate cake and ice cream we had
popped to drink

553
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,609
i think i had too much cake and ice
cream I was very full by the time the

554
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,808
party was over

555
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:46,930
we thank Jane and her mother before we
all went home

556
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:53,440
it was a very good party everyone had a
good time I hope Jane had a happy 10th

557
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,440
birthday

558
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,970
my classroom

559
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,890
my classroom is a large room

560
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,000
it's full of brightly colored pictures
my teacher hangs pictures up all over

561
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,930
the walls

562
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,640
there are black boards at the front of
the room my teacher always has writing

563
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,379
all over the blackboards

564
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,100
sometimes the chalk squeaks when she
writes on the blackboard

565
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,110
we cover our ears when that happens our
classroom is full of desks

566
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,120
there are a lot of students in our class
our desks are full of books notebooks

567
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,470
and pens

568
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,000
I try to keep my desk neat but I have a
lot of things in there

569
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,370
my ruler and pencils are always falling
out of my desk at the back of the room

570
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,650
is a bookcase full of books we can sign
those books out and take them home to

571
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,470
read i have read a lot of the books I
like mysteries and biographies

572
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,509
so i have taken many of those home there
are also tables at the back of the room

573
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,90
that's where we do our artwork we spread
out big sheets of paper and use paints

574
00:44:08,90 --> 00:44:12,770
or crayons to make pictures sometimes we
cut things out of magazines with

575
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,620
scissors and we glue pictures to the
paper

576
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,620
I like our class after school

577
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,549
my friends and I often erase the
blackboards for the teacher then we take

578
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,660
the erasers outside and clap them
together to get the chalk dust out of

579
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,319
them

580
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,820
my friends and I walk home together and
talk about what we did in school and

581
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,820
what we're going to do after supper

582
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,670
vacation

583
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,619
my family and I went on vacation to Lake
here on the water is beautiful and blue

584
00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:01,69
there and the sand is nice and white the
week that we were there was very hot the

585
00:45:01,69 --> 00:45:04,250
Sun was hot but the water was still very
cold

586
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,780
I went swimming and tried to catch
little fish in my hands

587
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,630
I was careful not to get sunburned we
stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a

588
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,770
game room

589
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:20,900
I played pinball and video games
sometimes I like to swim in the hotel

590
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,650
pool

591
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:26,720
but i like the beach better I would lie
on a big beach towel and get warm

592
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,808
then i would jump in the water and cool
off

593
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:35,210
sometimes I would just lie on the sand
and watch the waves roll up on shore

594
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,530
I found some seashells and saw a crab
walking on the sand

595
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,900
at first I was a bit lonely because I
didn't know anyone there

596
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,529
it wasn't long before I met some other
kids my age

597
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,250
we built sand castles together and swim
in the lake

598
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,470
the other kids were from different towns
so we told each other stories about our

599
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,240
schools and friends

600
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,140
we found that we had a lot in common
even though we were from different

601
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,279
places

602
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,960
our families got together and went to
restaurants together we played

603
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,920
volleyball on the beach and we SAT
around a campfire at night and sang

604
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,880
songs at the campfire we would roast
marshmallows on a stick

605
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,130
I always burned my marshmallows that is
ok I like them that way

606
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,540
mostly we just swim in the lake until we
were very tired

607
00:46:27,49 --> 00:46:32,30
I was sorry when our vacation was over I
had a good time at like here on

608
00:46:32,30 --> 00:46:35,809

still write to each other

00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,790
I get very excited I can hardly wait for
the ground to be covered with a blanket

669
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,410
of white snow

670
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,710
I put on my mittens my scarf my hat coat
and winter boots and I run out into the

671
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,329
fluffy snow

672
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:16,700
I have to be careful not to slip on the
ice it can get very icy and cold in the

673
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,720
winter

674
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,779
the first thing that I do is to build a
snowman

675
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:26,300
I sometimes build a snow fort to my
friends and I have a good snowball fight

676
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,440
we laugh a lot and our cheeks and noses
get very red

677
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,730
when we get too cold we go into the
house and have a cup of hot chocolate

678
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,609
my father fills the backyard with water
that freezes and turns into an ice rink

679
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,140
when the ice is hard enough my friends
and I get our skates and we go out on

680
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,790
the ice to play hockey

681
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:52,279
all of my friends on hockey sticks I am
usually the goalie and I have to keep

682
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,770
the puck from going into the net

683
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,830
my sister and her friends don't really
like to play hockey

684
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:03,200
they would rather just skate around on
the ice I took skating lessons so I

685
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,29
don't usually fall down

686
00:52:05,30 --> 00:52:09,140
my little brother is just learning to
skate so he falls down a lot

687
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:14,60
my father has to shovel the snow off the
paths and the driveway in the winter

688
00:52:14,60 --> 00:52:17,599
I help him shoveling snow is hard work

689
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,950
when my dad and I finish shoveling the
driveway we go into the house and warm

690
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,430
our hands and feet in front of the
fireplace

691
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,259
there is probably nothing more beautiful
than fresh fallen snow on the trees in

692
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,280
the morning when the Sun shines on the
snow it glistens

693
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,589
I like to leave my footprints in the
snow winter can be very beautiful and

694
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,589
exciting

695
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,538
autumn

696
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,450
some people call autumn the fall

697
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,759
all you can call it either one autumn is
the time when the leaves change color

698
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,680
they change from green to beautiful
shades of gold orange and red

699
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:06,619
it looks like an artist has come along
and painted all the trees the air starts

700
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:10,910
to get a little colder in the autumn we
begin to wear jackets or sweaters

701
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,770
we go back to school in the autumn the
teachers sometimes gets us to make leave

702
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:20,990
collections we collect different types
of leaves and make a display of them

703
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,759
autumn is the time when old friends get
back together and talk about what they

704
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,710
did on their summer vacations Halloween
comes in the autumn we dress up in

705
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,760
costumes

706
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,790
some of them are scary and some of them
are funny

707
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:39,560
we go from door to door and say Trick or
Treat and people give us candies

708
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,578
we wear masks on our faces and we have a
lot of fun

709
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:48,710
the autumn winds start to blow the wind
blows the leaves right off the trees

710
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,530
until the trees have bare branches

711
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,970
my friends and I have a lot of fun
outside before the winter leaves of

712
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:01,970
shivering we play football and soccer at
school after school we ride our bikes

713
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:06,410
through the piles of dry leaves the
leaves go flying through the air as we

714
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,670
drive through them

715
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,900
my parents rake the leaves up and put
them in a big pile

716
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,160
I like to jump in the big piles of
leaves but then my parents just have to

717
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,569
rake them up again

718
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:22,430
the skies get a little cloudier in the
autumn and we know that soon there will

719
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,419
be snow so we enjoy the brisk autumn
weather while we can

720
00:54:36,10 --> 00:54:38,640
summer

721
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,49
yeah who school is over we are free for
the summer

722
00:54:43,50 --> 00:54:43,320
my

723
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,880
friends and I run out on the last day of
school into the bright summer sun we

724
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,190
sing a song about no more pencils and no
more books we can hardly wait to do all

725
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,510
the summer things that we like to do we
go swimming we play baseball

726
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,210
we ride our bikes and we go to the beach
we go on vacations or some of us go to

727
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,380
summer camp

728
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,90
it is just nice to run barefoot through
the grass or lie on your back and look

729
00:55:09,90 --> 00:55:14,430
up at the clouds summer days are lazy
days we don't have to do school work

730
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:20,9
we listened to the buzzing of the bees
we watch the birds as they fly from tree

731
00:55:20,10 --> 00:55:24,750
to tree we go down to the pond and toss
rocks into the water

732
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:30,780
we eat ice cream and we have BBQ years
some of my friends parents have boats so

733
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,820

734
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:38,10
some of my friends go to their cottages
they have cottages on legs

735
00:55:38,10 --> 00:55:41,400
some of my friends even have summer jobs

736
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,160
my best friend works at a supermarket my
father pays me to do jobs for him

737
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,450
I cut the grass take out the garbage and
wash the car

738
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,589
I like to be outside in the sunshine on
Sundays

739
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,550
my mother will pack a picnic lunch and
we go down to the park

740
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:04,410
sometimes we play baseball there is also
a tennis court at the park

741
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:09,750
I'm a very good tennis player my sister
just likes to swing on the swings and

742
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,340
slide down the slide

743
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,80
we eat our sandwiches and watch out for
the ants that always seem to be a pic

744
00:56:16,80 --> 00:56:18,450
mix after we have our lunch

745
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,720
my sister and I run off to play with the
other children

746
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,779

book my skin gets Brown from the Sun in

that come with the Summer Sun summer is

749
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,250

750
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,250
I wish summer could go on forever

751
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,770
the doctor

752
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,970
I didn't feel very well last week I had
a sore throat and a fever

753
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:07,189
my mother took me to see the doctor when
we got there the nurse took my name and

754
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,710
said that the doctor would be with me
soon

755
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,950
the doctor was a very nice man in a
white jacket

756
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,870
I had seen the doctor before when i had
my tonsils out at the hospital the

757
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,569
doctor took a light and looked in my
ears

758
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,290
he put a stick on my tongue and he shone
his light into my mouth

759
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:30,350
he looked at my throat he said that my
throat was a bit swollen and red

760
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,770
he felt my neck and said my glands were
swollen

761
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,40
he took my temperature and said that it
was quite high

762
00:57:37,40 --> 00:57:40,550
he listened to my heart and he made me
cough

763
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:45,50
he asked me some questions he said he
might have to do some tests

764
00:57:45,50 --> 00:57:48,380
he sent me to get some blood taken out
of my arm

765
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,780
I was scared but it didn't really hurt
the doctor gave me some pills and told

766
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,60
me to take one in the morning and one at
night he told me to drink lots of fluids

767
00:57:59,60 --> 00:58:04,580
he told me to get plenty of sleep I did
exactly what the doctor told me to do it

768
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:09,350
wasn't very long before I was feeling
well again I think that I might like to

769
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:12,799
be a doctor when I grow up I would like
to make people feel better

770
00:58:26,99 --> 00:58:29,519
the dentist

771
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,899
my friend's father is a dentist he has
an office near my house

772
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:39,89
I went to see him on thursday his nurse
told me to sit in a very big chair

773
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:45,659
she tied a bit under my chin the dentist
came in he examined my teeth with some

774
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:47,399
shiny silver tools

775
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,819
he looked at my front teeth and my back
teeth

776
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:54,58
he told me that the back teeth were
called molars

777
00:58:54,59 --> 00:58:59,99
he told me to open wide he had a little
mirror that he used to look at my teeth

778
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,29
he said that I had good strong teeth

779
00:59:03,29 --> 00:59:07,890
he told me that I didn't have any
cavities I told him that I didn't need a

780
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,609
lot of candies and that I always brush
my teeth after every meal

781
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:18,118

if i flossed my teeth and I said yes I

782
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,279

that my teeth were healthy because i

783
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:25,259
took very good care of them

784
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:28,499
he left and told me to keep up the good
work

785
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:32,759
the dental hygienist came in and she
said that she would clean my teeth for

786
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:33,419

787
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:38,98

and then she put some polish on my teeth

788
00:59:38,99 --> 00:59:43,289
and began to clean them when she was
done she told me to spit into a bowl and

789
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,659

I hope they will like the play we have
all learned our lines and worked very

820
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,380
hard at making this play a success

821
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,560
emotions

822
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,790
do you ever think about your emotions
what kinds of things make you sad

823
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:14,230
I get sad when i get a bad mark in
school or when someone that I like moves

824
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,950
away

825
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,980
I sometimes see sad movies that make me
cry

826
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,280
I don't like to be sad I don't like to
have a frown on my face

827
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:28,149
I like to be happy I'm happy most of the
time parties make me happy being with my

828
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,680
friends makes me happy

829
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,609
lots of things make me happy if someone
tells me a joke

830
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:38,170
i laughs I enjoy laughing funny movies
make me laugh

831
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,350
I think that people look the best when
they smile

832
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:45,580
what kinds of things make you mad I get
mad when my brother breaks one of my

833
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,509
toys

834
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:51,250
I try not to show it when I get mad my
parents get mad at me if i come home

835
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:51,940
light

836
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:57,400
I don't think anger is a good emotion it
is best to stay calm and talk things

837
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,270
over

838
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,930
emotions come from inside you but they
show on your face

839
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:05,799
people can tell when you're mad or sad
or happy

840
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:13,29
I prefer to look happy sometimes I even
smile when I'm feeling sad and the smile

841
01:03:13,30 --> 01:03:16,30
makes me feel a little better

842
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,430

843
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:37,9

01:03:37,10 --> 01:03:38,869
paycheck every two weeks

name of the grocery store on it

846

847
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,740
parking lot and bring them back into the

848

851
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,180
on the stand so that it looks nice

852
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,990
the oranges roll away when i put them

853
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:16,40
I put out the apples bananas and grapes

854
01:04:16,40 --> 01:04:20,359
i stacked boxes up so that people can
buy cereal and cookies

855
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:23,569
I have to be careful or the boxes will
fall

856
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:27,950
there are cans of things which also need
to be placed on the shelves yesterday

857
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,40
the lie

858
01:04:34,40 --> 01:04:36,300
yesterday I told

859
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,520
I don't feel very good about it I was
bouncing a ball in the kitchen and the

860
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,130
ball bounced up and broke up

861
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:50,100
it was one of my mother's best cops so I
was afraid that she would be mad i put

862
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,480
the broken cut back on the table and I
didn't tell anyone that I had broken it

863
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,650
that night my mother asked who had
broken the cup

864
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,30
my brother said not me my sister said I
didn't do it

865
01:05:03,30 --> 01:05:07,170
I said I didn't break the cup but I was
lying

866
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,740
my mother said that we would all be
punished if someone didn't tell the

867
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,290
truth and say who broke the cup

868
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:18,180
I still did not tell her that I had
broken it she gave us one more chance

869
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,629
and she said she wasn't mad about the
cup

870
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,380
she just wanted us to be honest I still
didn't say anything

871
01:05:26,70 --> 01:05:31,110
my brother sister and I all got sent to
our rooms we had to stay in our rooms

872
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,190
all morning

873
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:37,530
my brother said it wasn't fair I felt
very bad because my brother and sister

874
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,600
were being punished because of me

875
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,680
I went to my mother and told her that I
had broken the cop

876
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,40
she said that she was not upset about
the broken Cup

877
01:05:47,40 --> 01:05:52,350
she knew that it was an accident she was
disappointed in me because I hadn't come

878
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,509
forward and told the truth

879
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,380
she said that she wouldn't have punished
me if I had been honest with her

880
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,590
I told my brother and sister that I was
sorry

881
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,430
I felt bad because they were punished
because i was dishonest

882
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,390
I told my mother that I was sorry that I
had lied to her

883
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:13,859
I told her that I had learned a lesson
honesty is the best policy

884
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,320
it is better to tell the truth it is not
a good feeling when people don't trust

885
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,10
you

886
01:06:20,10 --> 01:06:25,470
I have learned that lying just hurts
people sometimes it is hard to be honest

887
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,569
but it is the best way to be
