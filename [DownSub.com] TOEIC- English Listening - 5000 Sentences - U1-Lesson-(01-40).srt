00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,40
you could have a gentle breeze

493
00:31:59,40 --> 00:32:03,840
it might be very gusty so that the wind
pushes you

494
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,180
it is dangerous if the wind is very
strong a hurricane or tornado is very

495
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
dangerous

496
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,100
once in a while the weatherman says

497
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,820
cold pallets of ice that fall from the
sky

498

sometimes the weatherman will say that
there will be snow flurries

499
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,270
sometimes there is just a light dusting
of snow

500
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,860
sometimes there is a blizzard or a
snowstorm

501

have to be plowed

503
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:55,560
you need a hat coat mittens and boots on
a very cold day sometimes the weather

504
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,360
forecast is wrong

505
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,790
the weatherman might say that it will be
a sunny day but then the clouds come in

506
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,200
and it rains

507
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,530
