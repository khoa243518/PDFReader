Roger looked at Diane but said nothing

165
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:04,050
Albert moved his head slowly up and down
ill she's angry that's all he said

166
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,310
Molly always gets angry about money

214
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:09,420

222
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:02,130
Roger did

223
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,580

224
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:19,260

229
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,630
slowly

230
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,430
Roger went back upstairs he wanted to
dress before dr. Pratt arrived

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,320
dr. Pratt was a little fat man without
much hair

232
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:04,830
he was the family doctor and he knew all
the clocks and family very well he went

233
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,580
upstairs at once and looked at mollies
body

234
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:16,680
he looked carefully at the cup of coffee
and the empty cup on the table next to

235
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,610
her bed

236
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,630
I'm sorry Roger

237
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,430
he said where is Diane

238
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:32,130
she found me she went out with the dogs

239
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,870
Roger said she was angry with me

240
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,720
Aang

241
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,850
everyone dr. Pratt said nothing for a
minute

242
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,110
this is going to be very difficult

243
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,970

244
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,210

248
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I don't understand

249
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:27,500
I want to find out Roger went across to
the window and looked out at the garden

250
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,120
it was a beautiful summer morning

251
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,440
the sky was blue and the garden was
Green

252
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,159
it was all very quiet

253
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:50,480
his mother loved this garden but Tom
Briggs wanted the garden and Roger

254
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,539
wanted the garden - Roger felt worse and
worse

255
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:02,299
your mother took sleeping tablets

256
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:09,260
dr. Pratt said did you know on thursday

257
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:16,039
she had a new bottle of tablets but i
can't find it here in her room

258
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,740

kitchen and made some coffee

261
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,260
just then Diane came in with the dogs

262
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:51,590
Roger she said look I'm sorry I was
angry and said some angry things

263
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,890

well the bottle is not in her room

267
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,640
what I don't understand

268
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,960
Diane took the coffee and began to drink

269
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
her eyes look big and dark

270
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,750
just then dr. Pratt came into the
kitchen

271
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:41,940
they're coming at once he said Diane I

272
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,940

273
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,159
dr. Pratt I want to tell you about last
night

274
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,389
everyone was very angry

275
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:58,049
be quiet Roger said quickly

276
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,370
Diane never thinks before she opens her
mouth

277
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:13,590
he thought angrily Diane did not look at
Roger last night mother went to bed

278
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,230
early because everyone

279
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,110

tell the police

280
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:28,350
Rogers face went red sudden

281
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:35,309
only he felt afraid the police are going
to talk to everyone and ask questions

282
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,350
he thought and they're going to want
answers

283
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,340
it's going to be very difficult

284
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,770
he finished his coffee and stood up

285
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,309
I'm going upstairs

286
00:27:53,309 --> 00:28:04,169

Jackie finished a cigarette and looked
up at the inspector

401
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,770
her eyes were suddenly angry

402
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,000

403
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,180

412
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:07,450
Jackie left the room instead

413
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:13,540
- Walsh thought about her why was she
suddenly angry

414
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,830
the room was quiet

415
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,630

627
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,030
mother killed daddy

628
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:41,030

635
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:28,770
your mother was afraid of the police

636
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:40,260
and so she gave you the money but in the
end she wanted to stop you

637
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,160
she told dr. Pratt

638
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,640

639
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:54,359

mother

641
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,320

642
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,470
tell you

643
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:12,450
Diane began to cry I loved daddy

644
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:19,410
he always gave money to me he loved me

645
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:27,000
it was mother she didn't love daddy

646
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,330
and she didn't love me

647
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:37,350
Diane stopped the dogs got up and went
to the door

648
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:49,440

01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:57,000
I wanted to kill her but I didn't

651
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,490
the dog

652
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,150
this came back and sat down again
Diane's feet

653
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,920
inspector Walsh looked at Roger

654
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,900
mr. Clarkson also needed money

655
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,470
Rogers face went red

656
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:32,380
don't tell them please mr. Clarkson lost
his job last month he has no money but

657
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:39,010
he has an expensive house and an
expensive car

658
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,630
he likes expensive things

659
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:51,340
his sister's looked at him but Roger put
his hand over his eyes

660
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:58,060
don't talk to me it doesn't matter now

661
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:05,950
Diane said mother is dead and we have a
lot of money

662
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,970
you don't need a job

663
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:13,150
Rogers face went red again

664
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:26,920
be quiet Diane now inspector Walsh began
again Peter Hobbs is a very angry young

665
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,970
man

666
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:37,300
mrs. Clarkson was not very nice to him
he got the sleeping tablets from the

667
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:43,600
shop but did he put the tablets in the
hot milk

668
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:49,900
I think not Tom Briggs

669
01:05:49,900 --> 01:06:02,410
wanted half the garden for his farm he
was in the kitchen that night did he put

670
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,410
sleeping tablets in the hot milk

671
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:12,080
I think not sudden

672
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,470
and terrain for a minute

673
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:23,060
everyone watched it through the window
Jackie took a cigarette from her bag and

674
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:32,630
began to smoke but someone wanted Peter
Hobbs to come into the kitchen that

675
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:39,920
night she wanted everyone to see him and
listen to him

676
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:48,380
inspector Walsh said she I don't
understand

677
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:52,310
Roger began and stopped

678
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:58,790
inspector Walsh moved away from the
window and sat down

679
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,520
I'm

680
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,520

681
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:17,070

01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:05,889

01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:21,220
