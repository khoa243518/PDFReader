1
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,228
Bye, guys.

2
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:05,586
It's three years.

3
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,064
Three years together.

4
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,299
The lads.

5
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:09,577
Me and you?

6
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,021
We'll see each other again.
Really?

7
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,254
They're not going, are they?

8
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,776
Group hug!

9
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,577
See you, ladies!
See you later.

10
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,333
Group hug.

11
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:25,369
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,484
Tilly?

13
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,844
Callum!

14
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,758
Tilly, come on.
It's time to go home.

15
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,801
Come on.
Callum!

16
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,195
Ow!

17
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:43,150
You know,
we've never actually met.

18
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:44,427
Actually, we have.
Several times.

19
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,501
Have we?

20
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,422
You gatecrashed my birthday
party, called me Julie,

21
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:49,907
and spilled red wine
down my top.

22
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,056
Ouch.

23
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,184
Well, I'm sorry about that.

24
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:54,299
No, not at all.

25
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,371
You were delightful.

26
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,416
Was I?

27
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,172
No. No, you weren't.

28
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,373
Look, if you're
not Julie, then...

29
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,650
I'm Emma.
Emma.

30
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,850
Emma Morley.
Emma Morley.

31
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,329
Listen, I'll walk you home.

32
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:10,676
So this is me.

33
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,085
Shh!
Welcome home.

34
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,836
So debate is fine,
but anyone can talk...

35
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,664
Just sometimes,
action's what's needed.

36
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,063
To change the world.
I completely agree.

37
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,577
So what are you gonna be when
you're, I don't know, 40?

38
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:30,656
Forty?

39
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:33,776
Can I say famous?
Horribly rich?

40
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:36,455
Terrible.
You're so terribly posh.

41
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,255
Where are you going?

42
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,294
I'm just gonna
go brush my teeth.

43
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,810
You know, booze and fags and...

44
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:41,885
I don't mind.

45
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:43,010
I do.

46
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,722
Listen, won't be a minute.

47
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,641
No playing with yourself
while I'm gone.

48
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,519
What?

49
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:07,106
All right, concentrate.

50
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:10,862
Concentrate.
Do not cock this up!

51
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,445
Oh, you're going?

52
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,440
Well, it's getting light out,
so I thought I could just...

53
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,482
You should go
if you want to go.

54
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,634
It's very poignant.
Very bittersweet.

55
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,759
Really I just thought you
might wanna get some sleep.

56
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:35,877
I don't have to go.

57
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,076
No, no, go.
I'm not bothered.

58
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:38,598
Sneak off.

59
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:39,827
I wasn't sneaking off.

60
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,191
Jump out the window
for all I care.

61
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,708
It's five floors up, mind.

62
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,829
Look, I'll stay.
All right?

63
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,541
I'll stay.

64
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,028
Come on.

65
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,852
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

66
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,170
It's just whenever
I go to bed with someone,

67
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,566
I always end up
either laughing or weeping,

68
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,565
and it could be nice to go
for something in between.

69
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,086
Look, that's fine.

70
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:09,240
That's fine. Maybe we
could just be friends.

71
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,038
Okay. Friends.

72
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,748
Of course, you know it's Saint
Swithin's Day today, don't you?

73
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,426
What is?

74
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:33,463
Well, today.
Saint Swithin's Day, the 15th of July.

75
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,339
How do you know that?

76
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:38,173
Well, he was buried in
Winchester Cathedral,

77
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,452
which is where
I went to school.

78
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,975
Well, la-dee-da.

79
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,527
La-dee-da.

80
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,843
You know, there's a poem.

81
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,635
"If on Saint Swithin's Day,
it doth rain

82
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:56,034
"something, something,
something remain."

83
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,912
Dexter, that's beautiful.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
Shut up.

85
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,224
Let's get some sleep.

86
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,866
But, Dex.

87
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,338
Em?

88
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,175
If it doesn't rain...

89
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,615
Mmm-hmm?

90
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,575
...do you want to do something?
Me and you?

91
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:22,809
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,325
- Are you all right?
- Lift, lift.

93
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,518
Okay, well, I'm coming up.

94
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,278
Couldn't you have just hired
someone to move this stuff?

95
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:35,397
No.

96
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,599
Look, I would have paid.

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,873
All right, lift from your end.

98
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,548
You've obviously never done
a day's work in your life.

99
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:45,227
Look, seriously, Em,
my plane leaves in four hours.

100
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,744
All right, well, all the more
reason why you should lift.

101
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,347
God's sake.

102
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:51,615
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

103
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,660
And I am so, so grateful.

104
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:55,420
Stop whinging.

105
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,249
I bet this bed
could tell some stories.

106
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:02,566
Yeah, short stories.
Horror stories.

107
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:05,485
Welcome to London.
Well, lift it.

108
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,916
I think I'm gonna
be very happy here.

109
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,357
What is that smell?

110
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:14,842
Onions.

111
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:16,513
Onions and disappointment.

112
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,227
Right.

113
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,586
No, it's not that bad.

114
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,871
It's nothing
that a lick of paint

115
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,228
and a nuclear warhead
can't fix.

116
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:27,746
I've got my typewriter.
I've got my books. I'm in London.

117
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,096
I think it's
going to be all right.

118
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,415
I might actually
get things done.

119
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,382
You know, you might
actually meet someone.

120
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:33,453
Dexter, please.

121
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,572
A nice guy.

122
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:36,180
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

123
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,779
I told you I'm not interested
in any of that.

124
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,928
Matching glasses,
matching opinions.

125
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,449
I'm actually glad
you're going to India.

126
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:44,883
Good, 'cause I'm leaving.
I've got to catch my flight.

127
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,563
Already?

128
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,281
Yeah, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,277
Well, go on then.
Find yourself.

130
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,512
Keep sending me those letters.

131
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,431
Long ones.
I will.

132
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,033
And have fun, Em.

133
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,391
Of course.

134
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,034
You know, it is allowed.

135
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,704
You know, I've got a feeling
that this time next year

136
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,349
you're going to
take London by storm.

137
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:15,461
What is
the difference between...

138
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,860
A tortilla is
either corn or wheat.

139
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:18,850
But a corn tortilla
folded and filled is a taco,

140
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,928
whereas a filled
wheat tortilla is a burrito.

141
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,607
Deep fry a burrito,
it's a chimichanga.

142
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,445
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.

143
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,483
Is there any chance
you could repeat that?

144
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:35,436
Hello. I'm Ian.
Ian Whitehead.

145
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:37,431
The new boy.

146
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,315
Welcome to
the graveyard of ambition.

147
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:43,111
The kitchen.
All right, mate.

148
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,308
What these guys
can't do with a microwave

149
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,506
and a deep-fat fryer.

150
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,659
Hey, you!

151
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,502
Your basic
Tex-Mex food groups.

152
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:52,257
Cheese on top of
chicken under guacamole

153
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:54,777
on top of beans
under rice on top of beef.

154
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:58,414
Word of warning, avoid the jumbo prawns.

155
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:01,294
It's like Russian Roulette.
One in six will kill you.

156
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,490
So what's your stroke?

157
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,246
Sorry, my what?

158
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,686
Waiter/actor,
waiter/model, waiter/writer?

159
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,360
Well, I'm a comedian.

160
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:13,559
We could use a comedian.
We all like to laugh. I know I used to.

161
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,075
Well, I'm just
starting out really.

162
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:17,555
Working on my
"unique comedy stylings."

163
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,515
Not jokes so much, more sort
of wry, little observations.

164
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,467
Ay caramba!

165
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,065
I've got this whole bit
at the moment

166
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:27,300
about the difference
between men and women.

167
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,459
How blokes, when they see a girl
they fancy, they get all...

168
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,978
Toilets. Staff toilets.
Oh.

169
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,337
Sorry. You were saying?

170
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:37,617
No, no. I'm doing an open mic
tonight if you were interested.

171
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,325
At The House of Laffs,
spelled L-A-F-F-S.

172
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,564
It's not a date or anything.

173
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,644
You've probably got a
boyfriend anyway, have you?

174
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,480
Ian, I'd love to come,
but after work,

175
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:52,159
I like to head home,
comfort eat, weep.

176
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:56,758
So what about you, Emma?
What's your stroke?

177
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:58,750
What do you really do?

178
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,828
Uh, this. This is what I do.

179
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:05,026
Still, it's not forever, is it?

180
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,252
My room still smells. Tilly's sending me mad.
The flat's a dump.

181
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,298
I keep finding
teeth marks in the cheese

182
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,611
and her big gray bras
soaking in the sink.

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,495
Look, I'm sure it's
not a complete disaster.

184
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:23,013
London's swallowed me up.

185
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:27,569
I thought I'd make a difference,
but no one knows I'm here.

186
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,002
Listen, listen.
Nothing truly good was ever easy.

187
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,075
Who said that?

188
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,754
You did.

189
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:34,322
Did I? That's annoying.

190
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:39,111
I'm sorry for moaning. I just...
I really wanted to hear...

191
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,914
How's teaching? How's Paris?

192
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:42,829
It's good, Em.

193
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:45,301
You know,
truly, really fulfilling.

194
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,426
Well, don't sleep with
any of your students.

195
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,584
It's unethical and predictable.

196
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,304
It's good advice, Em.
Thank you.

197
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,776
But I've got to go
and have lunch with Mum.

198
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:57,136
Well,
apologize again, will you?

199
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,493
I didn't mean to
call your dad a fascist.

200
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,095
A bourgeois fascist.

201
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,085
Say sorry and, Dexter...

202
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,366
My money's running out.
Em?

203
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,606
Can you hear me?
Dex? Dex?

204
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,353
I miss you.

205
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:41,804
Forty-five
minutes late.

206
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,162
Yeah, well, I got waylaid.

207
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,844
And where were you last night?

208
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,245
Language school disco.

209
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,763
Was it fun?
No, it was hell.

210
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:52,757
Tell me, who's been writing
you all those long letters?

211
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:54,595
That is none of your business.

212
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,433
Was it that girl
who came to stay?

213
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,997
Yeah. Well, Emma and I
are just good friends.

214
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,105
How much holiday do you need?

215
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,942
I'm not on holiday.
I'm teaching English.

216
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,017
Dexter.

217
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,581
Isn't that Alain Delon?

218
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,970
What?
Oh, no. It's your father.

219
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,885
Picking his corns.
Stop it.

220
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,363
Take me for lunch tomorrow,
will you?

221
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:29,037
Just you and me.
Somewhere quiet with white tablecloths.

222
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,162
I want to talk to you.

223
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,354
Why? Is something wrong?

224
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,752
No. Nothing's wrong.

225
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,069
Then why do we need to talk?

226
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,871
Do I need a reason?

227
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,752
There you are.
Degenerate.

228
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:49,025
Now, I thought
you might want these.

229
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:52,379
Oh, thank you, my love.

230
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:57,849
So what's for supper?
Please, God, not French food.

231
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,071
Golden Boy wants to see you.
Hmm?

232
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,191
He's got a new one.

233
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,864
Good night.
Good night.

234
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,185
Night.
Good night.

235
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,264
Have a good one.

236
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,337
We were just kissing.

237
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,973
You were trying to fit her
entire head in your mouth.

238
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:36,098
People have enough trouble
keeping the food down as it is.

239
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,056
And what does she
see in you, anyway?

240
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,253
Well, she says I'm complicated.

241
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,133
You're just spoiled.

242
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,367
I got offered
the job of manager today.

243
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,913
They told me they wanted someone
who wasn't going anywhere.

244
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:55,039
All right, Em, listen.
I think you should take a bottle of tequila,

245
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,600
I think you should
walk out the door,

246
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,232
and I don't think you
need to ever come back.

247
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,830
But my job is my life.

248
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,986
You can't throw away years
of your life just because,

249
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,028
well, you think it's funny.

250
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,340
My hair smells of cheese.
Monterey Jack.

251
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:11,342
Look, I thought you
were writing poetry.

252
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,495
What, go where the money is?
Tried that. Failed.

253
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,419
You just can't see it, can you?

254
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:19,331
Look, you're funny.
You're attractive. You're smart.

255
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,407
I mean, you're
the smartest person I know.

256
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,808
Sure.
You are. You're attractive.

257
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,484
You're sexy.
What?

258
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,606
What? Is that supposed to be
sexist or something?

259
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:31,395
No, it's not sexist.
It's just ridiculous.

260
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:32,997
Em, listen.

261
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,636
If I could just give
you one gift, all right,

262
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,748
one gift for
the rest of your life,

263
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:42,633
do you know what I'd give you?

264
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,032
Confidence.

265
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:47,185
It's either that
or a scented candle.

266
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,666
Come here.

267
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:55,979
Emma? So I've disinfected
the meat fridge.

268
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,777
My hero.

269
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:00,417
Thank you, Ian.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:01,928
Bye, mate.

271
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,040
Bye, Emma.

272
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,926
I should go, too.
All right.

273
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,521
I'll be fine. I just
feel a bit lost, that's all.

274
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:13,878
Come on, everyone's lost at 25.

275
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,475
You're not.

276
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:19,597
Trainee TV producer.
Nice new flat. CD player.

277
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,507
Group sex Tuesdays and Fridays.

278
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,743
Yeah, but you know,
I am crying on the inside.

279
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,219
You know what you need,
don't you?

280
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:33,622
Mmm-mmm.

281
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,852
You need a holiday.

282
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,770
Look, Dexter, all I'm saying
is I think we need some rules.

283
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,414
Rules!

284
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,888
I'm not taking any chances with
our friendship, all right.

285
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:45,763
All right, all right.
Such as?

286
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:46,999
Separate bedrooms.

287
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,681
Wherever we stay, no shared
beds, no drunken cuddles.

288
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,801
I don't see the point
of cuddling, anyway.

289
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,999
Cuddling gives you cramp.

290
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,118
Agreed, then.

291
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,958
Rule number two.
No flirting.

292
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,312
No having a few drinks
and getting frisky with me.

293
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,385
Or anyone else.

294
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:02,430
Well, I never flirt.

295
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:04,026
I'm serious.

296
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,584
Hello, what's this?

297
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,055
Which leads me to rule three.

298
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:20,207
The nudity clause.
What?

299
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:22,490
I don't want to see you in
the shower, or have a wee.

300
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,052
Or have a wee in the shower.

301
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,366
Well, I can't promise that.

302
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,969
You have to, Dex.
It's the rules,

303
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,721
and absolutely
no skinny-dipping.

304
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,752
- All right, then.
- Rule number four. What?

305
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,592
No Scrabble.
I love Scrabble.

306
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,511
That is exactly
why it's my rule.

307
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:40,824
Look, we're not dead yet.

308
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,109
Voilà.

309
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:00,770
What is that?

310
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:04,209
Hmm? My swimming costume.
It's called the Edwardian.

311
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,804
No, the masonry paint.

312
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,482
It's factor 30. I burn.

313
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,514
Here, let me.

314
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:29,100
I've not seen this before.

315
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:31,699
What, that?
I got that in Thailand.

316
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,620
It's a yin-yang.

317
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,857
Looks like a road sign.

318
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,610
Yeah, well, it means "the
perfect union of opposites."

319
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,925
It means "wear some socks."

320
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,084
This is scooped
a bit low, isn't it?

321
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,997
Good job I didn't
put it on backwards.

322
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:07,385
I think I'll go for a dip.

323
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:33,315
This is a nudist beach.

324
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,437
No, it's not.

325
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:37,829
It is. Look.
They're barbecuing!

326
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,748
You see, I couldn't do that.
Barbecue naked.

327
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,551
What is that?
Is that yoga?

328
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:46,309
Oh, God.

329
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:49,857
Grow up, all right.
Back to your magazine.

330
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:58,138
I can hear you thinking.
It's like this crunching noise.

331
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,696
The answer is no.

332
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,813
Don't you think we'd feel more
comfortable with our clothes off?

333
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:04,610
Unbelievable.
Just unbelievable.

334
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:05,840
Well, why not?

335
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:09,159
The rules.
Not to mention your girlfriend.

336
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:10,645
What, Ingrid?
Yeah, Ingrid.

337
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,715
She's very uninhibited.

338
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,599
She'd have had her top off
at the check-in desk.

339
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,955
Well, as you keep pointing out,
Ingrid used to be a model.

340
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,392
You could be a model.

341
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,705
For a catalog or something.

342
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm just saying that we're not
entirely unknown to each other

343
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,105
from a physical point of view.

344
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,305
Drop it, Dex.

345
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:30,220
Well, you know,
that night after graduation.

346
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:31,704
Come on, you must remember.

347
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,541
No. Blanked it out
like a car crash.

348
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,930
Well, I haven't.

349
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,249
In fact, if I close my eyes,

350
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,975
I can still see you there just
standing in the dawn light.

351
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,090
Please don't.

352
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,970
Provocatively
unclasping your dungarees

353
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:46,166
as you walk over to me.

354
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,841
I was not wearing dungarees.

355
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,838
So you do remember, huh?

356
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,236
Have I caught the sun?

357
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:01,673
No, you look...

358
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,425
You look fine.

359
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,692
Do you know I've
never been abroad?

360
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,257
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

361
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:20,769
It's true.

362
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,811
Fortnight in a caravan in Whitby
drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad

363
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:26,246
and trying not to kill Mum.

364
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:35,953
I can't believe I'm
actually here with you.

365
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,235
Why?
Hmm?

366
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,635
Why?

367
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,344
When we were at university,
before we spoke even,

368
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,848
I had a crush on you.

369
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:01,607
Ridiculous, I know.

370
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:06,480
But when we almost

371
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,365
did it that night,

372
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,321
I couldn't believe it.

373
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,636
I wrote poems and everything.

374
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:20,108
What have you
got to say to that?

375
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:22,389
Well, I already knew.

376
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,425
What do you mean, you knew?

377
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,543
Well, I sort of guessed.

378
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:34,174
All those epic letters
and compilation tapes.

379
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:36,932
So, go on then.
What happened?

380
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,246
Mmm.

381
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:41,055
I got to know you.
You cured me of you.

382
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:47,443
I'd still like to read those poems.
What rhymes with Dexter?

383
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:49,995
Prick. It's a half-rhyme.

384
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,721
Too much wine. We should go.

385
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,710
No, no, no.
Not yet. Not yet.

386
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,105
Listen, let's go for a walk.

387
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,303
So this is it.

388
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,980
It's lovely.

389
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,815
Hello? What's going on here?

390
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:16,209
Well, I thought we'd go for a quick swim.
Sober us up.

391
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,131
Ah, I get it. I get it.

392
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:21,093
I've walked right
into it, haven't I?

393
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:25,687
You get a girl drunk and lead
her to a large body of water.

394
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,044
Oh, come on, Em.
Be spontaneous.

395
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:30,765
Be reckless.
Live for the moment!

396
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,749
Come on, Em. Get in!

397
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,110
No!

398
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:45,105
You're such a prude.
Why are you such a prude?

399
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,828
Look, come on!

400
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,940
You could at least
leave your underpants on.

401
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,502
Rule number three, remember?

402
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,061
Come on.

403
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,913
So this is skinny-dipping?

404
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:25,502
What am I meant to do? Sort of lark about?
Splash you or something?

405
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,488
That's a very serious face.

406
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:39,652
You're not
having a wee, are you?

407
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,089
No.

408
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,444
No, I just wanted to say that

409
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:51,719
I felt the same.

410
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,071
After our near-miss.

411
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:01,075
I mean, I didn't write poems or anything.
I'm not insane.

412
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,987
But, you know,
I thought about you.

413
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,340
I think about you.

414
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:10,579
You and me.

415
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,177
Really?

416
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:17,175
Really? Okay, well...

417
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:20,489
Dex...

418
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:24,321
The problem is I fancy
pretty much everyone.

419
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,196
Oh. I see.
I mean anyone.

420
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,998
Really, I mean, it's like I've just
got out of prison, all the time.

421
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,960
It's a real problem.
I can imagine.

422
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:36,508
Yeah, and this thing with
Ingrid, it's a sex thing.

423
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,793
It's just sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

424
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:41,184
The point's been made, Dex.

425
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,821
But me and you,
it would be different.

426
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,574
I think we'd want
different things,

427
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:56,128
and I don't think
I'm ready, you know.

428
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,846
If you wanted to,
you know, have a bit of fun,

429
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:03,361
holiday fling, no obligations.

430
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:15,553
Oh, God. I'll take that
as a no then, shall I?

431
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:16,914
I think so. I think
our moment's passed.

432
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,636
Come on, I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

433
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:21,546
No, no, you are, Dex.
That's the problem.

434
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:23,032
You're worried I might care.

435
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:26,183
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

436
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,623
Come back,
you little... Hey!

437
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:32,060
Thieves!
Come back. Come back here.

438
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:33,622
Wait!

439
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:36,493
They've stolen my clothes!
You little...

440
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:43,885
Will someone call the police?
Wait! Come back!

441
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:48,877
Could you please stop laughing
and do something to help?

442
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:53,879
Armani, that suit was.

443
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,635
The little frogs
even took my underpants.

444
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,708
Armani?

445
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,947
No, Calvin Klein.

446
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:00,549
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

447
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,187
Little French bastards!

448
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,103
They took your plimsolls, too.

449
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:06,943
They're not plimsolls.
I've never worn plimsolls in my life.

450
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,939
They were penny loafers,
and I bloody loved them!

451
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:13,654
What? It's not funny.
I'm a victim of crime here.

452
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,693
Dex?

453
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,006
What?

454
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:23,611
Your Calvin Klein underpants.

455
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,443
I'll find them.

456
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,122
I swear to you,
I shall track them down.

457
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,436
Go to sleep.

458
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,427
I wonder how many
rules we broke.

459
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,347
All of them.

460
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:42,747
Except Scrabble.

461
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,424
Tomorrow, maybe.

462
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:11,961
Who says quality TV is dead?

463
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,761
Plenty more of this when we
come back after the break,

464
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:14,877
so do not go away.

465
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:17,553
I'm warning you.
We know where you live.

466
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,195
Go on, get out of here.

467
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,335
Look, I just called,
all right, to let you know

468
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:42,207
that you are the best friend
I've ever had.

469
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,846
I'm touched, Dex, but
you're off your face. And?

470
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,807
Look, it's 5:00 in
the morning. Go home.

471
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:50,083
And you have
an incredible body.

472
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,644
Dex!

473
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:52,872
Is that Dexter?

474
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,761
Just promise me
you'll go home, please?

475
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:56,592
I will, I will, I will,
I will, I will, I will.

476
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,191
Dex, you have work
in the morning. Dex...

477
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,750
Look, good night, all right?

478
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:04,428
Remember, you are absolutely,
truly amazing.

479
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,747
Dexter? Dex?

480
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,255
You're amazing

481
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,252
and famous.

482
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,976
I'm not that famous.

483
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:34,218
Aye, aye.
How are you, old man?

484
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:40,491
Your mother's upstairs.
She's been waiting all morning for you.

485
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,440
Good God, why are
you sweating like that?

486
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,598
Well, it's a hot day.

487
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:51,879
No, it's not.

488
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:53,918
Look, how is she?

489
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,594
Well, why don't you go and see?

490
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:03,581
Mum?

491
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,251
Hello, hello.

492
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,762
Hello, stranger.

493
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,836
Look, I've got
a present for you here.

494
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:34,390
It's not from me.
It's from Emma.

495
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,154
Here, let me.

496
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,473
Thank you.

497
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,386
Oh, how lovely.

498
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:52,058
A little ambitious maybe.

499
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,497
You might want to push her towards
short stories in the future.

500
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,456
Mum, don't.

501
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:07,638
So what have you been up to?

502
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,509
I'm Dexter Mayhew.
What a show we've got for you tonight.

503
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,585
We've got a man who claims...

504
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,145
I'll skip this next bit.

505
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,580
There's an interview
that's pretty good.

506
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:35,011
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

507
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:41,330
The live show is
always a bit patchy.

508
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,607
I don't understand why you
have to use that voice,

509
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,839
but then I suppose I just don't
care for this sort of thing.

510
00:32:47,928 --> 00:32:50,042
It's just a bit
of fun for kids.

511
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,359
They just watch it
after the pub.

512
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:53,841
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

513
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,434
No, it's not that.

514
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:58,351
You know, honestly, Dexter.
Dancing girls in cages.

515
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:00,392
Is this what it's come to?

516
00:33:00,476 --> 00:33:01,827
I just host it.

517
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,585
It's a means to an end,
that's all.

518
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:04,945
But to what end?

519
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,224
We always said you could
do anything you wanted.

520
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,945
Fine. What do you
want me to do?

521
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:11,855
Something good.
It is good.

522
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:16,172
I just do what I'm told.
Look, this is what I can do.

523
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,407
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,081
The medication makes me ratty.

525
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:33,520
I just need a little lie-down.
I'll be better tonight.

526
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:35,989
Yeah, you know, um...

527
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,910
Actually, I've got
this premiere thingy tonight.

528
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:44,224
Look, I'm sorry. I can't miss it.
It's Jurassic Park.

529
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:54,693
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some help.

530
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,687
Are you all right?
Here, put your arm around me.

531
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,649
All right.
All right?

532
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:09,921
Are you all right?

533
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,994
Yes.

534
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:44,285
Can I get you anything?
Water? Dry martini?

535
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,219
What time is it?

536
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,851
Quarter past 6:00.

537
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,012
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

538
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:22,924
I'm afraid
you've missed our day.

539
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:25,968
Your father's
a little angry with you.

540
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,561
Look, I'll stay tonight.

541
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:31,153
No. You go.

542
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:35,831
No pleasure for me watching you and
your father snarling at each other.

543
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:39,952
Can I speak frankly?

544
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,269
Do you have to?

545
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,071
I think it's my prerogative.

546
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:51,100
I know that you're going to be a fine man.
Decent, loving, accomplished.

547
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,457
But I don't think
you're there yet.

548
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:57,451
And right now, well, I worry

549
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:03,686
that you're not
very nice anymore.

550
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:10,763
Well, there's
nothing I can say to that.

551
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,993
There is nothing you have to.

552
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,469
I'm not going to
argue with you.

553
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,301
You can come and collect
your car when you're sober.

554
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:32,263
You're being ridiculous.
I mean, you cannot confiscate my car key.

555
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,060
Do not dare to
insult my intelligence!

556
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,531
Now your mother loves you very much.
You know that.

557
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:41,566
But for whatever time
she has left to her...

558
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:51,801
If you ever, ever come to see
your mother in this state again,

559
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,077
I will not let you
in the house.

560
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:56,508
I will close the door
in your face. Now...

561
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:00,704
Go.

562
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,626
Fine.

563
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:22,724
You're not there. I just remembered
you're on a hot date tonight.

564
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:25,727
I'm too late.

565
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:29,764
Okay, can you call me
when you get this?

566
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,278
It's just I need
to speak to someone.

567
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:35,000
Not someone. You.

568
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,749
A chainsaw for an arm.
It was mad.

569
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,187
It's a work of timeless beauty.

570
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:44,580
It's the finest of
the trilogy, methinks.

571
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:47,501
And I still understood it without
seeing Evil Dead I or Evil Dead II.

572
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,941
My only complaint would be that
there wasn't enough violence.

573
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:54,900
- You didn't mind, did you?
- Blue?

574
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,526
I'm gonna skip a starter
because I had those nachos,

575
00:37:58,657 --> 00:38:02,612
but you go ahead.
You can have anything you like.

576
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:06,642
Anything up to
the value of, say, £14.00?

577
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:10,120
No, no, seriously, no, have anything.

578
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,319
Well, you know, within reason.

579
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:17,392
It's just so good
to see you again.

580
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:20,665
And you're going to be
an amazing teacher.

581
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,425
Congratulations.
Thanks.

582
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:24,627
I wish I'd had more
teachers like you.

583
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:28,416
Not that I'd have got any work done.
Miss Morley.

584
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:38,368
You have no new messages.

585
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:47,323
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

586
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,442
Sometimes, Emma,
I think the only way

587
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:51,593
I'm going to see
my name up in lights

588
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:54,400
is if I change it
to Emergency Exit.

589
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:59,425
Anyway, I'm doing an improvisation
night at the moment.

590
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,153
Mr. Giggles.
Not his real name.

591
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:03,792
But I think I'm gonna stick to
the more observational material.

592
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:05,190
I've got this whole
thing at the moment

593
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,588
about the difference
between cats and dogs.

594
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:08,259
Hey, please stop.

595
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,574
Okay. Do you know
what the hardest thing

596
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,024
about being
a stand-up comedian is?

597
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,502
Is it the clothes?

598
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:14,021
Very good. No.

599
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,770
It's that people expect you
to be on all the time.

600
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,245
Because if you're not being
funny, then what are you being?

601
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,688
Ian, it's not a performance.

602
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,650
Except it sort of is,
though, isn't it?

603
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,755
I've been so excited about seeing you.
Like nervous.

604
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:39,431
I'm sorry, I...

605
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,743
I'm no good at
this stuff, either.

606
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,585
It's just I graduated today.

607
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,786
I'm finally, actually qualified
to do something useful,

608
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:50,658
and I wanted to
celebrate with someone.

609
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:52,058
Was Dexter busy?

610
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:04,365
Em, when you hear this, can you
just get in a cab? And I'll pay.

611
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,798
Maybe you could even stay over, you
know, on the sofa or something?

612
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:13,271
I need to just see you.

613
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:16,237
Please, can you just come over?

614
00:40:18,837 --> 00:40:20,791
Emma Morley?
Hmm?

615
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,192
Can I say something?

616
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,025
Go on.

617
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,658
I think you are
the absolute bollocks.

618
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:31,974
You, with your honeyed words.

619
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,009
I should probably head home.

620
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,290
Don't go.
Let's go somewhere else.

621
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:48,882
I live near, actually.
I mean, it's a dump, like, horrible.

622
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:53,081
But I've got music and booze.

623
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:54,594
Or a hot, milky drink
if you prefer.

624
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,315
We could go on
an Ovaltine bender.

625
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:08,901
All right. Okay.
One, two, three, go!

626
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:11,299
Which way?

627
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:12,896
This way, this way, this way!

628
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:27,881
That's not needy.
That's just affection.

629
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,957
I've just got
a lot of love to give.

630
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,825
Well, if I can't call you,
can I come and see you?

631
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,750
Do you know where
the matches are?

632
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:44,946
No.

633
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:48,144
You might wanna leave it
for a couple of minutes. Go.

634
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,932
Hi, Miss Morley.
Hi.

635
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,928
There gonna be
a showbiz party afterwards

636
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,926
with champagne, and canapés,
and the tinkle of laughter?

637
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:04,809
It's a school play, Ian.
I suspect we'll be home by half 9:00.

638
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:07,846
Why don't you stay at mine for a change?
I'll wash my duvet cover.

639
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,719
Is that your boyfriend,
Miss Morley?

640
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:11,522
Oy! Cheeky.

641
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:15,478
Greetings, boys and girls.
Welcome to the Late Night Lock In.

642
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,549
Camera one, Dexter.

643
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:19,513
The show that is late,
live and loud.

644
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:21,585
Dexter, gentleman to see you.

645
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:22,628
Mind the cables, sir.

646
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,588
- Hey.
- Okay, ladies.

647
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,497
I helped myself
to tea and buns.

648
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:33,380
I hope I'm not going
to get you into trouble.

649
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:35,694
I'm sure it'll be fine.

650
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,934
There he is! Hey!

651
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:40,405
Doesn't he look gorgeous?
Come to Suki.

652
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:43,086
Suki Sue. Come here.

653
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:48,406
I just want to eat you up.

654
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:54,519
Suki, actually,
look, this is my father.

655
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:56,317
Wotcha, Mr. M.

656
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,592
Isn't your son gorgeous?

657
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,074
Um, he's very nice.

658
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:02,030
And where's Mrs. M?

659
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,178
Sadly, she passed away.

660
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:12,300
Barry, I need some water.

661
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:13,895
What an appalling woman.

662
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:16,447
Actually,
she's sort of my girlfriend.

663
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:18,846
Oh, well, congratulations.

664
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:24,840
Your mother would have been
most impressed.

665
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:28,596
Thanks, Dad.

666
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:30,835
I'll be watching at home
if I can stay awake.

667
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,439
Have fun

668
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:36,953
and don't take any notice of
what they say in the papers.

669
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:39,266
Okay, sir. If you'd
like to come this way.

670
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:40,470
Please.

671
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:44,061
I'm the king of
car crash television.

672
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,503
But you're the king of it.
That's good.

673
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,704
Caption under photo. "Odious."

674
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:50,058
Why can't you come again?

675
00:43:50,185 --> 00:43:51,503
Because I'm working.

676
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:53,493
I'll send a car to
come and pick you up.

677
00:43:53,662 --> 00:43:55,571
Dex, I can't.

678
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,450
I know, and I'm sorry.
I'm just so much better when you're around.

679
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,053
Look, I'm just worried
I'm gonna be

680
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:02,686
stood in front of
the camera thinking,

681
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,250
"What's the bloody point?"

682
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:06,638
The show's ridiculous.
I'm such a fraud, Em.

683
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,843
Hey, come on. That's enough.

684
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:11,518
You know what you're doing.
You'll be fine.

685
00:44:11,604 --> 00:44:12,592
Right.

686
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,433
Just don't speak
in that weird voice, okay?

687
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,554
Okay.
All right. Bye.

688
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:21,422
Get ready. Here we go.

689
00:44:21,514 --> 00:44:23,264
- Great stuff.
- Let's move. Let's move!

690
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:24,704
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

691
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,418
We're on, superstar.

692
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:45,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Late Night Lock In.

693
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,999
The show that is late, live...

694
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:49,077
And loud!

695
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,314
And what a show
we've got for you tonight.

696
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,319
Yay!

697
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,553
Well done, darling.

698
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:01,663
Thank you.

699
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:03,788
Come on, Miss Morley.

700
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,223
Bravo!

701
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,614
The Maxi Crew, ladies and gentlemen.
The Maxi Crew.

702
00:45:18,697 --> 00:45:22,970
All right, take a seat, fellas.
Take a seat. You can sit down there.

703
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:27,838
Right, guys, I just wanna start by
saying that that jam was fresh.

704
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:31,553
Right, okay, so let's kick it off with...
Let's ask some questions.

705
00:45:31,644 --> 00:45:35,189
What is hip hop?
Is this the voice from the street?

706
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,349
Is this why you guys
are just so angry?

707
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:39,630
No, dawg.

708
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:41,352
It's chill,
it's chill, it's chill.

709
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:47,856
Right, okay. Listen,
can you rap about anything?

710
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:50,413
For example, could you rap
about a cheese sandwich?

711
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:53,460
- Are you new here?
- Have you done this before?

712
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,487
- Oh, dear.
- Do not try this at home.

713
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:04,839
Ian?

714
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,602
Do you think you'll
finish painting today?

715
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:09,200
I'd like to at least
get the TV back inside.

716
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:12,156
All right, all right.
I can have breakfast first, can't I?

717
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:13,397
We've had breakfast.

718
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,868
All right, brunch, then.

719
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:18,187
Brunch. Is it lunch?
Is it breakfast?

720
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,510
No, it's brunch.
What about brinner, say?

721
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:22,185
Or brupper?

722
00:46:22,273 --> 00:46:23,785
Well, I should get on.

723
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:25,468
Bearhug, snootch?

724
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,379
I thought we agreed
about snootch?

725
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:31,013
I can't seem to say anything
right these days, can I?

726
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:33,774
Look, if you don't
want me to go tonight...

727
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:35,618
No, you should go.

728
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,251
Or if you wanted
to come with us...

729
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:39,929
What? Dexter ignoring me, and you
talking over me? No, thank you.

730
00:46:40,015 --> 00:46:41,049
It won't be like that.

731
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:42,242
Anyway, I've got a gig tonight

732
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,287
at The Rose & Crown,
Sir Laffalots.

733
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,440
Paid gig?

734
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:47,677
No.

735
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,995
Better get back to it then.

736
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,439
Thirty-four identical essays
on Lord of the Flies.

737
00:46:51,524 --> 00:46:57,195
Em? About 1700 hours, do you
fancy a little bit of the old...

738
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:00,510
You know, Afternoon delight?

739
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:19,605
Wow!

740
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,851
You look incredible.

741
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:23,604
Oh... Ooh!

742
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,567
Let's see the dress.

743
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:28,282
Is it vintage?

744
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:29,441
No, it's brand new.

745
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:30,923
Really?
Mmm.

746
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:33,311
Well, you look great,
and I love the shoes.

747
00:47:33,402 --> 00:47:36,788
Thank you. It's the world's
first orthopedic high heel.

748
00:47:36,878 --> 00:47:39,470
Look, it's been too long, Em.

749
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,862
I need to have some fun tonight.
Can we have fun, please?

750
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,185
God, sorry.

751
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,177
Look, I'll be two seconds.
It's work.

752
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:48,382
I'm naked!

753
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:49,660
Suki, you nutter.

754
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,973
Where are you, baby?

755
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:52,780
I thought you were supposed
to be at the party.

756
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,696
You do know they
damage your brain?

757
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,773
They do not damage your brain.

758
00:47:57,857 --> 00:47:59,335
How can you tell?

759
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:01,007
Ha ha, very funny, Em.

760
00:48:01,094 --> 00:48:03,652
I guarantee you, one year, one year,
and you'll have one of these.

761
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:07,607
You're on. If I ever get a mobile
phone, you can buy me dinner.

762
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:09,677
What, again?

763
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:14,510
So, come on.
How's the king of comedy?

764
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,793
Oh, Ian's fine.
We both are.

765
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:18,515
Are you still
very much in love?

766
00:48:18,597 --> 00:48:22,427
He can belch the theme to The A-Team.
I'm only flesh and blood.

767
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:25,740
I don't know. These days,
we don't seem to...

768
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:28,625
And how's the new place?
How's that?

769
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:32,491
Flat's fine. Well, it's a room
and a half in murder mile.

770
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,139
And Ian's been
talking about painting

771
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:36,096
the same wall
for the past six months.

772
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,850
But it's got potential.
There's a view. The Gasworks.

773
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:43,410
You should come round.

774
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:45,009
Mmm! Mmm.

775
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,802
How's Suki?

776
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,077
Oh, she's fantastic.
Yeah, gorgeous.

777
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:55,469
What's great for me is that she
really understands the industry.

778
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,946
You know, she knows exactly
what it's like to be...

779
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,392
I was gonna say "famous."
God, we hate the word.

780
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,029
Every time I turn on the telly,

781
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,589
she's there in
a pink rubber catsuit.

782
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:07,386
She's doing incredibly well.

783
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:09,258
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,175
Well, we both are.

785
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:15,296
I've got some really, really
exciting stuff coming up.

786
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,050
It's all sort of
in development.

787
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,252
If I told you,
I'd have to shoot you.

788
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:20,733
Please do.

789
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:26,159
Never mind.
Start without me, all right?

790
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:43,660
Hello.

791
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,705
There you are. Enjoy.

792
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,857
What are you doing,
you silly thing?

793
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,061
Well, listen, we'll talk later.

794
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:55,289
Look at this.
This looks gorgeous.

795
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,209
Are you all right?
Maybe she could join us?

796
00:49:57,298 --> 00:50:01,367
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
I'm here to see you, remember?

797
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:04,329
Right, well,
how's the teaching?

798
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:06,882
What? If you're not
interested, don't ask.

799
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:08,525
I am interested.

800
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,959
I just thought you were going to
be writing this novel, that's all.

801
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:13,158
And I will.
But I have to earn a living.

802
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:15,668
More to the point, I enjoy it.
I'm a bloody good teacher, Dexter.

803
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:18,112
I'm sure you are.

804
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:19,515
Still, you know what they say?

805
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:21,107
No, what do they say?

806
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:23,422
You know, "Those who can..."

807
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:27,659
No, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar.
Finish the sentence.

808
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:32,294
All right.
Well, "Those who can, do,

809
00:50:32,383 --> 00:50:35,178
"and those who can't, teach."

810
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:40,971
And those who can teach say,
"Go fuck yourself!"

811
00:50:42,692 --> 00:50:45,726
Em! Em, come on.
Look, whatever I've done, I'm sorry.

812
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,321
You've obviously
had a bit too much to drink.

813
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:49,243
No, you're drunk!
You're drunk!

814
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:53,116
Do you realize that I have literally
not seen you sober for three years?

815
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,037
Nipping off to
the toilet every 10 minutes.

816
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,915
Either you're on coke,
or you've got dysentery.

817
00:50:56,998 --> 00:50:59,873
Either way, it's boring!
Banging on about yourself all the time.

818
00:50:59,955 --> 00:51:03,864
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex, but
you're a TV presenter, all right?

819
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:05,309
You've not invented penicillin.

820
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,299
All you do is stand around
shouting, "Make some noise!"

821
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:09,502
Look, I am having fun,
that's all.

822
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:11,779
I've been through
a lot recently.

823
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:13,011
I might get a bit carried away,

824
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:14,330
but if you wouldn't
stop getting at me...

825
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,568
Am I?
I don't mean to, and I...

826
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:20,131
I know that you've been through a
lot with your mum and all, I know.

827
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:24,443
But, there are things that I
needed to talk to you about.

828
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:28,724
About how I am
stuck in this flat

829
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:30,363
with a man that I am
not in love with.

830
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:34,752
And if I can't talk to you, then
what is the point of you? Of us?

831
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,397
What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

832
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,109
I think we've
outgrown each other.

833
00:51:38,197 --> 00:51:41,470
No, you have outgrown me.
You think I'm uncool and dreary.

834
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:43,383
I don't think
you're dreary. Em...

835
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:48,097
I think if it's over, then we should
just face facts. Say goodbye.

836
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:49,664
It sounds like
you're dumping me.

837
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:51,257
Yeah, maybe I am.

838
00:51:51,344 --> 00:51:53,060
You're not who you used to be.

839
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:56,176
Come on, Em.
Look, I apologize!

840
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,855
Please.

841
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,044
Come on. That's it.

842
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:10,438
There.

843
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:16,198
I love you, Dexter. So much.

844
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:21,666
I just don't like you anymore.

845
00:52:22,113 --> 00:52:24,261
I'm sorry.

846
00:52:59,795 --> 00:53:01,829
Johnny Cage wins.

847
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:04,743
That's an almighty win
from the Blade Cruisers there.

848
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,342
I think you'll all agree.
Well done, guys.

849
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:10,780
That's all from tonight's Joy Stick Jockeys.
Join us next week

850
00:53:10,864 --> 00:53:14,694
when we review the smoking hot
new console games coming at you.

851
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,008
Until then, night owls,
keep gaming.

852
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:25,841
Do I really have to
say "smoking hot"?

853
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,397
It's just I'm 32,
for God's sake.

854
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:33,999
What, they're sacking me?

855
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,354
You see, sack has
negative connotations.

856
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:39,393
It's just they wanna
try a new presenter.

857
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:42,026
So they are sacking me?

858
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:44,147
Well, no, they're taking the
show in a different direction,

859
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:47,458
but it's a direction
away from you.

860
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:48,899
Okay, so less you now.

861
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:49,940
Okay.

862
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:51,820
More you in your 20s.

863
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,773
Right. Right.

864
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,812
So, what's the good news?

865
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:00,964
Sorry?

866
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:05,328
Well, you said you had some bad news.
What's the good news?

867
00:54:12,003 --> 00:54:14,434
Every career has
its ups and downs.

868
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,947
This is just
a bloody great down.

869
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:18,754
And I sense a bit of
disenchantment, Dexy.

870
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:21,064
Just a little concerned
about my future.

871
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,904
It's not quite
what I was expecting.

872
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:28,179
The future never is.
That's what makes it so bloody exciting!

873
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:31,939
Everyone loves you, yeah?

874
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:36,217
But they love you in that ironic,
love-to-hate kind of way.

875
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:37,889
Right?
And all that we need to do

876
00:54:37,977 --> 00:54:40,329
is just find someone
that loves you for real.

877
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:44,488
Okay?
Yeah.

878
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:50,836
I love you, Sylvie.

879
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:55,116
No, no, wait.
No, I'm in love with you.

880
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,387
Look, I've never said
this to anyone before.

881
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:00,227
Well, that's a lie. Um...

882
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:04,021
I love you, Sylvie. I...

883
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:10,812
Sylvie tells me you used
to be quite well known.

884
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:12,574
TV presenter or something.

885
00:55:12,662 --> 00:55:15,537
I did. Yeah.
Once upon a time.

886
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:19,290
Yes, on Larginit. That program.
Do you remember, Mummy?

887
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,602
You used to really hate it.

888
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:21,682
Yes.

889
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:23,363
"Turn it off," she used to say.

890
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:25,798
"Turn it off. It's
killing your brain cells."

891
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,559
That was you, was it?

892
00:55:27,647 --> 00:55:29,317
You still work
in television, Dexter?

893
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:33,280
Not so much, no.
That sort of drifted away, really.

894
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:34,395
Uh-huh.

895
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,674
Dexter's just being modest.
He gets lots of offers.

896
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,586
Anyway, what he really
wants to do is produce.

897
00:55:43,192 --> 00:55:44,509
Party games.

898
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:49,298
Are you there, Moriarty?

899
00:55:49,425 --> 00:55:50,823
Here.

900
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,330
Two for two, nice work, bro.

901
00:55:53,421 --> 00:55:54,409
Going for a hat trick.

902
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,728
Are you there, Moriarty?

903
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:57,966
Here.

904
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,330
The crowd goes wild!

905
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,167
There's my boy!

906
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:07,566
Better luck next time, son.
Thank you.

907
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:10,159
Well, I'm still
very proud of you.

908
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,354
Oh, isn't this fun?

909
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,589
Dexter, care to take me on?
Oh, no.

910
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:16,713
That's a terrific idea.

911
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:17,786
Darling, are you sure?

912
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,513
Yes, I'm sure.

913
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:21,750
- Come on, chap.
- Pick up your weapon.

914
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,901
Nice and tight, Mum.

915
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:27,460
- All right?
- All right.

916
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:30,099
- Very good. MRS.
- We don't want you cheating.

917
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:32,094
Good luck.
All right.

918
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:34,058
Come on, sis.

919
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:42,930
All right, ready?

920
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:44,523
As ready as I'll...

921
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,394
Good God, man!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

922
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:50,321
- That table was from Italy.
- I'm so sorry.

923
00:56:50,404 --> 00:56:52,632
I must have just caught her
at a funny angle there.

924
00:56:52,722 --> 00:56:55,517
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty.

925
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,508
I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't know what I was thinking.

926
00:56:59,595 --> 00:57:01,027
Wanker!

927
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:15,848
Serves me right
for not changing the locks.

928
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:17,087
Looking good, Ian.

929
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:18,410
You can get stuffed, Emma.

930
00:57:18,496 --> 00:57:19,450
Is that from your act?

931
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:22,609
No, though I have got this new
thing I've been working on.

932
00:57:22,692 --> 00:57:23,965
God.

933
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:27,085
I come on, and I say, "Here's a funny story.
You'll like this."

934
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,440
Ian.
"There's this guy,

935
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:32,912
"and he's going out with this
girl, and he worships her,

936
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:35,467
"and they buy
this flat together.

937
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:38,389
"And then he gets her
an engagement ring, the lot.

938
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:43,306
"It turns out that she is still
in love with her best friend."

939
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:46,539
Interesting theory, Ian, except
I've not seen Dexter for ages.

940
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:48,344
No?
That is not the reason.

941
00:57:48,426 --> 00:57:53,370
Do you know how he found out about it?
He read it in her poetry.

942
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,779
You bastard!

943
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,769
Give it back to me!
"Our graduation night!

944
00:57:56,858 --> 00:57:58,892
"The erotic intensity
of the shared bed."

945
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,931
"That magic week in France."
It's all here in blank verse.

946
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:04,604
If you ever, ever, come in here
again I will call the police!

947
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,280
Call the bloody police!
It's my flat, too!

948
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:08,556
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

949
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:12,112
You just sat around farting and
watching the bloody Wrath of Khan!

950
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,395
You love The Wrath of Khan.

951
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:16,197
I hate The Wrath of Khan.

952
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,825
It's a good job
we didn't get married.

953
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:28,420
I'm sorry about going
through all your stuff.

954
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:31,097
I've just been a bit mad
recently, that's all.

955
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:32,934
It's all right.

956
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,768
I miss you.

957
00:58:37,857 --> 00:58:39,129
I know you do.

958
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,204
Like, right here.

959
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:48,238
Either that, or it's
trapped wind. I'm not sure.

960
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:50,434
Either way, it'll pass.

961
00:58:50,524 --> 00:58:52,478
It's good, by the way.

962
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,073
Not the poems.
The poems are awful,

963
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,108
but the rest of the stuff,
the stories. You're funny.

964
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:01,070
Proper funny.

965
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,380
Not like me.
Ian.

966
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:04,108
No, I'm just saying that you
should show them to someone,

967
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:07,065
because you're
better than you know.

968
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:22,726
Oh!

969
01:00:30,784 --> 01:00:34,295
So that's Emma Morley.
We went to university together.

970
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,607
Did you sleep with her as well?

971
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:36,971
No.

972
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:38,205
What about the bride?

973
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,171
- No.
- God, what is this?

974
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,766
It's just that every weekend
we go to a wedding

975
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,441
with a coachload of people
that you've slept with.

976
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:48,845
It's like a conference.

977
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:50,192
Okay. Come on.

978
01:00:50,364 --> 01:00:51,921
You know you're the only one for me now.

979
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:54,719
You are. Come on,
come here. Come here.

980
01:00:59,954 --> 01:01:02,420
Hummus wraps.
Organic smoothies.

981
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:04,262
Fair Trade coffees.

982
01:01:05,988 --> 01:01:09,694
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy
for the little buggers.

983
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:15,088
I've got 12 branches already.
Twelve more by the end of the year.

984
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,691
Well, you know,
there's a rumor going around

985
01:01:16,778 --> 01:01:18,414
that you're actually
a multi millionaire.

986
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,206
Come on.

987
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:22,724
Well, define multi.

988
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,364
You should come and have lunch.
We should talk.

989
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:30,843
What, are you
offering me a job?

990
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:32,395
No, I'm just saying...

991
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:34,913
You are, aren't you?
You're offering me a job.

992
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:37,431
Look, I haven't seen you
on telly for a while.

993
01:01:37,517 --> 01:01:39,471
I thought if you
wanted a fresh start...

994
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,549
Callum, mate.
Mate, mate, mate.

995
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:44,667
At university, you wore the
same pair of jeans for...

996
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,704
What was it, four years?

997
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,662
Long time ago now, pal.

998
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:52,933
We're not students anymore.

999
01:01:53,021 --> 01:01:54,248
Someone seems
to be enjoying it.

1000
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,488
Look, look over here.

1001
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,135
Have you seen Emma Morley?

1002
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,775
Right under our noses
all this time. Eh?

1003
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:01,965
Who knew?

1004
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:06,485
I sit and wait

1005
01:02:06,568 --> 01:02:09,682
Does an angel

1006
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:13,117
Contemplate my fate

1007
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,863
Do they know

1008
01:02:18,955 --> 01:02:22,069
I tell you, the one
discovery changed my life.

1009
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,179
Crayfish.

1010
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:28,303
I've got 12 branches already.
Another 12 by the end of the year.

1011
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:30,340
I was telling Dexter there's
plenty of opportunities.

1012
01:02:30,424 --> 01:02:32,731
Darling, I'll be back in a bit.

1013
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:37,256
Do you want some champagne?

1014
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,724
It's not champagne.
It's Spanish.

1015
01:02:42,412 --> 01:02:45,799
When I'm lying in my bed

1016
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:48,798
Thoughts running
through my head

1017
01:02:48,885 --> 01:02:51,681
And I feel that love is dead

1018
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:56,274
I'm loving angels instead

1019
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:57,472
Do you want to get out of here?

1020
01:02:57,557 --> 01:02:58,705
Yes, please.

1021
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:03,467
And through it all
She offers me protection

1022
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:06,062
A lot of love and affection

1023
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:10,497
Today must be quite tough for you,
having slept with the bride.

1024
01:03:11,942 --> 01:03:14,454
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1025
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,846
What? How do you
know all these things?

1026
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:19,766
Tilly told me all about it.
Oh, did she?

1027
01:03:19,854 --> 01:03:22,809
The foot massage
spun out of control.

1028
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:25,483
I think you even
used my olive oil.

1029
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:28,239
Footprints halfway
up the kitchen wall.

1030
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,722
Well, that stuff's
behind me now, so...

1031
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:33,120
Really, what happened?

1032
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:35,877
Sex in toilet cubicles
lose its bittersweet charm?

1033
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,550
Well, an orgy won't keep you
warm at night, Emma.

1034
01:03:38,636 --> 01:03:40,465
An orgy won't look after you
when you're old.

1035
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:41,871
Well said.

1036
01:03:45,229 --> 01:03:48,343
Anyway, I screwed up my career.

1037
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:50,494
And screwed up things with Mum.

1038
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:54,055
That's not true.

1039
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:57,326
And I screwed up
my friendships.

1040
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:03,839
And then Sylvie
just came along.

1041
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,883
And she sort of,
well, saved me, really.

1042
01:04:10,164 --> 01:04:12,118
She's very beautiful.

1043
01:04:12,202 --> 01:04:14,838
Of course, she has absolutely
no sense of humor.

1044
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,030
Just as well.
A sense of humor's overrated.

1045
01:04:18,156 --> 01:04:20,270
Goofing around all the time.

1046
01:04:20,354 --> 01:04:22,502
The only time Ian
ever really made me laugh

1047
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,103
was when he fell
down the stairs.

1048
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,145
Well, you know, Sylvie says
she doesn't like to laugh.

1049
01:04:27,227 --> 01:04:30,500
Doesn't really like
what it does to her face.

1050
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:37,772
But you love her, right?

1051
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:43,648
Yeah, I worship her.

1052
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:50,399
I'm loving Colin instead

1053
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:57,226
Oh, no, no. This way.

1054
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,669
Where are we going?

1055
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:00,669
Dex?

1056
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,742
Oh!

1057
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:11,377
So, come on, then.
You, huh?

1058
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:13,258
Any romance?

1059
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:14,818
Don't start, Dex.

1060
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:15,887
What?

1061
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:19,887
Your sympathy.
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

1062
01:05:19,974 --> 01:05:21,724
There, how'd that sound?

1063
01:05:21,812 --> 01:05:23,766
Yeah, yeah.
I bought that.

1064
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,077
It's true.

1065
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:30,522
I've got a tiny advance
to write this book.

1066
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,356
Em!

1067
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:33,675
Mmm-hmm.

1068
01:05:37,277 --> 01:05:40,948
Well, you know, I have
something to tell you, too.

1069
01:05:47,187 --> 01:05:48,937
You're getting married.

1070
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:50,537
Yeah.

1071
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:56,932
So, you're pleased?

1072
01:05:57,017 --> 01:06:00,245
Of course I'm pleased, Dex.
Fantastic news, really.

1073
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:05,759
Scented? Your wedding
invitations are scented.

1074
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:07,757
Yeah, lavender.

1075
01:06:07,846 --> 01:06:10,915
No, Dex, it's money.
They smell of money.

1076
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:17,715
August 14th?

1077
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:21,422
Yeah, I think that's what
they call a shotgun wedding.

1078
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:24,665
For 350.

1079
01:06:26,348 --> 01:06:27,859
With buffet.

1080
01:06:39,854 --> 01:06:41,286
Do you know who the father is?

1081
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,770
Stop it.

1082
01:06:42,851 --> 01:06:44,680
I'm kidding.

1083
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:45,803
Congratulations.

1084
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:46,876
Thank you.

1085
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:48,524
A dad.
I know.

1086
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:51,519
Is that allowed?
Will they let you?

1087
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:53,676
It's incredible, isn't it?

1088
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,908
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

1089
01:06:56,997 --> 01:06:58,429
Do you really think so?

1090
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:00,232
I don't doubt it for a minute.

1091
01:07:11,023 --> 01:07:12,898
I missed you, Dex.

1092
01:07:14,939 --> 01:07:16,893
Well, I missed you, too.

1093
01:07:26,528 --> 01:07:28,357
No more disappearing.

1094
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:32,197
No, well, I won't if you won't.

1095
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,952
Mmm?
Mmm.

1096
01:07:47,706 --> 01:07:48,854
Dex?

1097
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:52,020
We should go.

1098
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,289
Absolutely, let's go.

1099
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:05,045
Come on, Jasmine.
Come on.

1100
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:09,998
Come on.
You gonna stop crying?

1101
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,250
How you getting on?

1102
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:34,296
Good, mate.
Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,606
Not quite what
I was expecting, but...

1104
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:36,726
How do you mean?

1105
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:39,772
Well, you see the words
organic and homemade...

1106
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:41,843
Yeah, I know.
You imagined a couple of hippies

1107
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:44,762
on a little farm somewhere,
knitting their own muesli.

1108
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:46,838
Nice idea,
but this is business, Dex.

1109
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:49,155
Yeah, well, I realize that.
Here's your last two.

1110
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:53,913
Listen, mate. You're only here
to learn the ropes, okay?

1111
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,511
Company policy.
Everyone has to.

1112
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,905
Callum, I'm enjoying it.

1113
01:08:57,996 --> 01:08:59,428
Honestly, I'm good.

1114
01:09:01,113 --> 01:09:02,863
There's plenty of formula left.

1115
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:06,344
I've pureed the veggies,
or you could mash a banana.

1116
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:10,099
And what about Indian food?
I can give her a curry, can't I?

1117
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:12,332
No, no, no, Dexter. No.

1118
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:13,819
Sylvie, I'm joking.

1119
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,258
Oh, I see.

1120
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:17,168
I keep missing those, don't I?

1121
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:18,927
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm late.

1122
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:20,725
I don't even
know why I'm going.

1123
01:09:20,813 --> 01:09:22,688
I'm too old for hen nights.
No, you're not.

1124
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:23,839
That's my cab.

1125
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,078
Right, come on, then.

1126
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:26,486
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

1127
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:27,880
Okay.

1128
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:29,795
Be good. Try not to
burn the house down.

1129
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:30,918
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

1130
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,547
Goodbye, my sweetheart.
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1131
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:38,115
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1132
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:41,185
Oh, I know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,500
Have a good time.

1134
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:54,933
Oh! Come on.
We'll be all right, won't we?

1135
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:57,655
Party
started there's no end in sight

1136
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:00,328
Everybody's moving
to the rhythm that's inside

1137
01:10:01,772 --> 01:10:07,557
It's a crazy world but
tonight's the right situation

1138
01:10:08,006 --> 01:10:10,199
I am Spartacus.

1139
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,468
No, I'm Spartacus.

1140
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:18,908
No, I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus.

1141
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:21,268
Wahey! Let's have a big hand and
give a round of applause...

1142
01:10:21,353 --> 01:10:23,262
Look, Jas.
Look, that's Daddy's ex.

1143
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,418
...for basketball
stars TJ and Mickey D!

1144
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:26,940
Isn't she loud?

1145
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:29,743
Can you even fit them in a two-shot?

1146
01:10:29,864 --> 01:10:33,455
They are so tall.
I'm practically melting over here.

1147
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,254
Isn't she a loud, loud girl?

1148
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:41,690
"Julie Criscoll,
aged 15, wanted

1149
01:10:41,852 --> 01:10:44,727
"nothing more than
to change the world.

1150
01:10:45,728 --> 01:10:48,922
"If only all the politicians
would actually listen."

1151
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:52,874
Yeah, well that's Em.

1152
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,995
Is that Em? Yeah, that's Em.
She wrote the book.

1153
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:01,941
Emma?

1154
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:03,260
It's me.

1155
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,702
I'm so sorry, darling.

1156
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:08,142
Look, how's the party going?
How's it all going?

1157
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:09,533
Um...

1158
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,778
We're all going on
to some club. How is she?

1159
01:11:11,862 --> 01:11:13,612
Asleep. You know, finally.

1160
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,013
She's been awake all this time?

1161
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:19,007
Yeah, my fault.
I should have given her the decaf.

1162
01:11:20,773 --> 01:11:23,285
See? There you go.
I made you laugh.

1163
01:11:25,968 --> 01:11:27,319
Are you all right?

1164
01:11:27,446 --> 01:11:29,674
Yeah.
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

1165
01:11:29,764 --> 01:11:30,912
Why? Were you worried?

1166
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:32,151
Oh, no. Um...

1167
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:35,195
No reason. I just...

1168
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:39,105
Well, I was just
checking up on you and...

1169
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,546
Well, everything's fine.

1170
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:42,824
All right.

1171
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,506
Look, Sylvie,

1172
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:50,575
I know I'm not good at all this,
you know, dad/husband thing.

1173
01:11:51,702 --> 01:11:54,089
You're doing fine, Dexter.

1174
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,169
No, and I know
if you had a receipt,

1175
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,530
you would have taken me back
a long time ago.

1176
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:03,644
But, you know, I'm working on it, all right?
So bear with me. That's all.

1177
01:12:04,889 --> 01:12:06,525
I've got to go.

1178
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:09,795
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

1179
01:12:09,884 --> 01:12:11,838
Night.
Good night.

1180
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:15,573
Funny?

1181
01:13:15,698 --> 01:13:16,686
Very funny.

1182
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:22,210
Well, look at you.
You even look like a writer.

1183
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:24,840
A writer in Paris.

1184
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,877
There's a word for this,
isn't there?

1185
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:29,761
Uh, butch.

1186
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:31,560
I was gonna say gamine.

1187
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:33,548
What do you look like?

1188
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,594
Me? A screwed-up divorcé.

1189
01:13:38,195 --> 01:13:41,946
So my apartment's not far.
Shall we?

1190
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:44,185
How long are you staying for?

1191
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:47,338
I suppose it's up to you,
really. It's just...

1192
01:13:48,225 --> 01:13:50,021
Look, I just
wanted to say something

1193
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:51,894
which I couldn't
really do over the phone.

1194
01:13:51,982 --> 01:13:54,174
Well, ever since we were
last together in London...

1195
01:13:54,259 --> 01:13:57,453
Dexter, before you say
anything else, I have to...

1196
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,164
There's something
I have to tell you.

1197
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,276
You've met someone!

1198
01:14:05,368 --> 01:14:07,197
Is that really
so hard to believe?

1199
01:14:07,286 --> 01:14:09,116
A man?
Yes, a man. A guy.

1200
01:14:09,204 --> 01:14:12,080
A guy! He's a guy now,
is he? I see.

1201
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:14,878
He's called Jean-Pierre,
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

1202
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:16,151
What, he's French?

1203
01:14:16,237 --> 01:14:17,351
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

1204
01:14:17,676 --> 01:14:22,791
He's handsome. He's charming.
He's just very, very French.

1205
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:24,700
What, you mean rude?

1206
01:14:24,789 --> 01:14:26,345
No.
Arrogant?

1207
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:28,381
Smokes too much,
wears a string of onions.

1208
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,613
Why are you being like this?

1209
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:33,533
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what you mean?
You're having lots of sex?

1210
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,256
Since when do I need
to ask your permission?

1211
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,816
God knows you never asked mine.

1212
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:39,489
But we just slept together.

1213
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:44,681
I haven't forgotten.

1214
01:14:50,163 --> 01:14:52,436
Dexter, we got a bit drunk.

1215
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,111
Yeah, not that drunk.

1216
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,069
You took your trousers off
over your shoes.

1217
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:57,675
No, I didn't.

1218
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:00,142
Did I?

1219
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:03,905
I think that you were upset
about Sylvie and the divorce,

1220
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:06,382
and you needed
a shoulder to cry on.

1221
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,024
Or sleep with.

1222
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:11,651
And that's what I was,
a shoulder to sleep with.

1223
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:14,498
And that's why you did it, was it?
To cheer me up.

1224
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:15,727
Well, it worked, didn't it?

1225
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:27,235
If you must know, it was one of
the better nights of my life.

1226
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:28,553
See?

1227
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:32,119
Don't fish.

1228
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,594
Dex, it was one time.

1229
01:15:37,276 --> 01:15:39,344
Well, it was three times.

1230
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:45,544
Come on.
Look, you don't think it's a good idea?

1231
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,344
You and me.

1232
01:15:49,664 --> 01:15:51,573
I do. I did.

1233
01:15:51,662 --> 01:15:52,776
In the late '80s.

1234
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:53,895
Right.

1235
01:15:58,255 --> 01:15:59,607
Better get going.

1236
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:01,085
Why? What are we doing?

1237
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:02,524
Jean-Pierre wants
to meet you.

1238
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:03,924
Oh, you're kidding.

1239
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,964
We're going to hear him play.

1240
01:16:06,047 --> 01:16:07,081
Play?

1241
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,154
He's a jazz musician.

1242
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:10,952
Bastard.

1243
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:13,998
We're going to listen to him play free
jazz on the piano for about nine hours,

1244
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:16,830
and it's going to be lots of
fun and in no way awkward.

1245
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,046
You're not going out
like that, are you?

1246
01:16:47,446 --> 01:16:48,798
Just do me up.

1247
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,758
That's Jean-Pierre.

1248
01:16:54,839 --> 01:16:55,986
Where?

1249
01:16:57,276 --> 01:17:01,345
Oh, God. You could have at least
found someone a bit good-looking.

1250
01:17:04,349 --> 01:17:08,577
You know, Em, I'm sure
he's a fine jazz pianist.

1251
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:10,779
I just don't think
I can do this.

1252
01:17:11,662 --> 01:17:12,935
Oh. Really?

1253
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,532
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie
and go back to the apartment.

1254
01:17:17,656 --> 01:17:21,167
And then I think I'm going to get
the first train back tomorrow.

1255
01:17:21,252 --> 01:17:22,525
You don't have to leave.

1256
01:17:22,691 --> 01:17:23,963
I think I do.

1257
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:32,032
I'm sorry, Dex.

1258
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:34,474
Hey, don't be.

1259
01:17:40,793 --> 01:17:42,019
Go on.

1260
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:56,688
Salut.
Hey.

1261
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:01,227
Wait! Dexter!

1262
01:19:08,185 --> 01:19:10,299
I thought I got rid of you.

1263
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,239
If you muck me about, Dexter...

1264
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:27,322
Em, I swear.
I swear I won't.

1265
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:29,594
Lead me on, or let me down,
or go behind my back,

1266
01:19:29,684 --> 01:19:30,831
I will murder you.

1267
01:19:30,922 --> 01:19:31,956
I won't do that.

1268
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,478
You swear?

1269
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:40,229
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

1270
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:04,207
I would like to thank
everyone for coming to our wedding.

1271
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:08,483
For what can only be described
as a whirlwind romance.

1272
01:20:08,565 --> 01:20:09,713
Pause for laughter.

1273
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:17,993
Seriously, when people ask
how Emma and I first met,

1274
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:21,024
I tell them that
we grew up together.

1275
01:20:21,352 --> 01:20:23,181
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

1276
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,259
You're not going to say, "Blah,
blah, blah," on the day, are you?

1277
01:20:25,348 --> 01:20:26,541
You are not supposed
to be hearing this.

1278
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:27,741
What if I have notes?

1279
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:28,979
Come on, let me see.

1280
01:20:29,064 --> 01:20:30,542
No, no.

1281
01:20:30,623 --> 01:20:32,815
When we're married, you're
going to have to obey me.

1282
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,492
Yeah, I'm sure
that's going to happen.

1283
01:20:36,697 --> 01:20:40,163
What? Not again?

1284
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:41,685
You don't mind, do you?

1285
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,283
No, I don't mind.

1286
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:47,997
Although, there are
health and safety issues.

1287
01:20:48,884 --> 01:20:50,952
I could lose my license.

1288
01:21:06,227 --> 01:21:08,659
They'll wonder
where we've got to.

1289
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:16,686
Mmm! Mmm.

1290
01:21:16,776 --> 01:21:19,890
I can definitely smell burning.

1291
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:24,883
Hello, hello.

1292
01:21:25,008 --> 01:21:26,156
Hi, there.

1293
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:28,838
Come here, you.
Here we go.

1294
01:21:28,924 --> 01:21:31,879
Do you want to give me a big kiss?
Give me a big kiss.

1295
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:33,711
Go on.

1296
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:36,595
TV between 5:30 and 6:00,
but no more.

1297
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:38,506
And she has to
be in bed by 7:30.

1298
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:40,504
All right,
do you want to run inside?

1299
01:21:40,593 --> 01:21:42,070
Go see Emma. Good girl.

1300
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:43,424
I'm out here, Jasmine.

1301
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,896
She's loving coming
here at the moment.

1302
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,220
Well, good. That's great.

1303
01:21:47,306 --> 01:21:49,942
I'm really pleased for you.

1304
01:21:50,023 --> 01:21:51,535
Look, I'd invite you in.
It's just...

1305
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:54,928
No, it's fine.
We've got to go and see my family.

1306
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:56,688
Have fun.
Thanks.

1307
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,007
In you get, Moriarty.

1308
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,638
Dexter?
Yeah.

1309
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,550
I've been thinking.

1310
01:22:16,796 --> 01:22:18,228
So have I.

1311
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:30,333
I want a child
with the man I love.

1312
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,929
And if he won't do it,
then I want one with you.

1313
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:44,601
Well, then,
we'd better get started.

1314
01:23:28,724 --> 01:23:30,315
I look so tired.

1315
01:23:30,403 --> 01:23:32,755
So take some exercise.
Come swimming with me later.

1316
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,227
No, no, I can't.
I've got to do too much at the cafe.

1317
01:23:36,317 --> 01:23:37,907
Fine. Don't.

1318
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,825
By the way, in case you're
interested, I'm not pregnant.

1319
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,505
Em, how do you know?

1320
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:49,183
How do you think?

1321
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:50,900
We could try again, though.

1322
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:55,375
Come on, look...
No, no, no, no. Come on.

1323
01:23:57,456 --> 01:24:00,172
Look, I'm sorry.
All right?

1324
01:24:02,331 --> 01:24:04,796
No, I am
for taking it out on you.

1325
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:09,957
We're not at our best today,
are we?

1326
01:24:11,362 --> 01:24:16,589
Listen, why don't we meet
each other after work?

1327
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:19,904
We'll go to the movies.
Your choice.

1328
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:21,902
Something with subtitles.

1329
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:23,349
Ooh.

1330
01:24:24,349 --> 01:24:26,940
And we can go and have some dinner.
Just you and me,

1331
01:24:27,026 --> 01:24:31,015
and we can work this out.
All right?

1332
01:24:31,102 --> 01:24:32,454
I promise.
Mmm-hmm.

1333
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,932
Yeah.

1334
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:35,167
Okay.

1335
01:25:18,854 --> 01:25:20,843
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

1336
01:25:25,048 --> 01:25:29,719
Hey, there. Just to say I'm
running late, but I'm on my way.

1337
01:25:29,803 --> 01:25:32,712
I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

1338
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:29,417
Hey, there. Just to say I'm
running late, but I'm on my way.

1339
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:33,975
And I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

1340
01:26:34,059 --> 01:26:37,253
I just wanted to say you're a
fine thing, Dexter Mayhew.

1341
01:26:37,336 --> 01:26:39,290
I love you very much.

1342
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:41,965
Okay, there you go. Lucky you!

1343
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:26,975
Dad.

1344
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,931
- Dexter?
- Hello, darling.

1345
01:28:35,497 --> 01:28:37,134
Jasmine!

1346
01:28:40,452 --> 01:28:43,521
Are you all right?
Go and get dressed.

1347
01:28:44,568 --> 01:28:46,046
Sylvie, Sylvie.
Dexter?

1348
01:28:46,127 --> 01:28:49,433
Sylvie, Sylvie, I screwed up.

1349
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:50,591
Jasmine, now!

1350
01:28:50,682 --> 01:28:52,352
I screwed up.

1351
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,071
It's all right.
You're all right.

1352
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,915
No, I screwed up.

1353
01:28:56,037 --> 01:28:57,832
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on.

1354
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:04,980
I'm so sorry.

1355
01:29:05,068 --> 01:29:06,136
It's all right.

1356
01:29:06,227 --> 01:29:07,704
Aw, Dex, come on.

1357
01:29:10,023 --> 01:29:12,295
You poor thing.

1358
01:29:16,696 --> 01:29:19,162
Oh, God. Dexter.

1359
01:30:00,772 --> 01:30:04,841
As the rain came down,
the water levels began to rise.

1360
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:10,519
So is this going to be an
annual festival, do you think?

1361
01:30:11,002 --> 01:30:13,513
Every year, 15th of July?

1362
01:30:15,078 --> 01:30:17,589
Well, I hope not.

1363
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:20,107
I don't want
a heart-to-heart.

1364
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,618
Do you?

1365
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:26,425
No, no. I'd rather not.

1366
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:30,256
Except to say, that I think the
best thing that you could do

1367
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:36,452
would be to try to live your
life as if Emma was still here.

1368
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:40,491
Don't you?

1369
01:30:46,686 --> 01:30:47,754
I don't know if I can.

1370
01:30:47,845 --> 01:30:49,196
Of course you can.

1371
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,710
What do you think I've been
doing for the past 10 years?

1372
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:10,261
Now Silent Witness is on.
9:00.

1373
01:31:15,497 --> 01:31:16,849
Right.

1374
01:31:29,203 --> 01:31:30,601
Ian. God!

1375
01:31:30,682 --> 01:31:31,670
Dexter.

1376
01:31:31,761 --> 01:31:33,431
Hi.
Hello, mate.

1377
01:31:33,519 --> 01:31:35,906
Are you well?
Yeah, look at this.

1378
01:31:37,076 --> 01:31:39,428
So, how are you?
How's the stand-up comedy?

1379
01:31:39,513 --> 01:31:41,342
Oh, well,
I gave that up, actually.

1380
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:42,505
That's a shame.

1381
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:46,101
No, not really,
because I was never any good.

1382
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:48,095
The only time
I ever made Emma laugh

1383
01:31:48,184 --> 01:31:50,650
was when I fell down
the stairs. Really.

1384
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,976
No, I'm in insurance now.

1385
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:56,167
Great, great.

1386
01:32:00,692 --> 01:32:03,920
I hate today.
Fifteenth of July.

1387
01:32:06,206 --> 01:32:08,160
Saint Swithin's Day.

1388
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:10,795
It's a tough one.

1389
01:32:10,882 --> 01:32:16,872
I never noticed it before, but it was
always there just waiting, lurking.

1390
01:32:18,594 --> 01:32:20,583
I used to hate you, too.

1391
01:32:20,672 --> 01:32:24,025
Quite violently, actually, Dexter.
No, I'm sorry, but...

1392
01:32:24,108 --> 01:32:29,131
Because, she lit up with you.

1393
01:32:31,341 --> 01:32:34,489
Just in a way that
she never would with me,

1394
01:32:34,578 --> 01:32:37,647
and it used to make me
so angry because...

1395
01:32:38,494 --> 01:32:42,768
I didn't think that you deserved her.
Can I say this?

1396
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,566
Yeah, go on.

1397
01:32:44,688 --> 01:32:46,404
She made you decent.

1398
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:54,070
And then in return,
you made her so happy.

1399
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:55,596
So happy.

1400
01:32:57,715 --> 01:33:02,067
And I will always be
grateful to you for that.

1401
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:10,771
And on that bombshell,
back to the sticks.

1402
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:12,612
There's my lot out there.
Oh! Look at them.

1403
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,456
Yeah, I know.

1404
01:33:16,336 --> 01:33:19,325
So, listen, we'll stay in touch.
I'll give you a call.

1405
01:33:19,413 --> 01:33:23,163
No, I don't think that's necessary.
I think we're done here.

1406
01:33:24,568 --> 01:33:25,841
Come here.

1407
01:33:27,045 --> 01:33:28,272
Good luck, mate. All right?

1408
01:33:28,444 --> 01:33:29,671
You, too.

1409
01:33:29,763 --> 01:33:31,080
Thank you.

1410
01:33:38,394 --> 01:33:39,826
You've got cake everywhere.

1411
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:45,146
Wake up.

1412
01:33:47,345 --> 01:33:48,743
Wake up.

1413
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:56,928
It's all right.
Don't panic. It's only me.

1414
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,686
Emma. Emma Morley.

1415
01:33:59,853 --> 01:34:01,330
Yes. Hello.

1416
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:04,727
So what do you suggest we do?

1417
01:34:06,406 --> 01:34:08,759
We could stay in touch.

1418
01:34:08,844 --> 01:34:11,878
Today. We're meant
to be doing something today.

1419
01:34:13,559 --> 01:34:15,115
Right. Right, right.

1420
01:34:15,237 --> 01:34:19,306
Look, today's a bit
tricky for me, really.

1421
01:34:19,393 --> 01:34:21,905
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

1422
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,098
Well, I'm meeting my parents, and
then I've got to get back...

1423
01:34:24,188 --> 01:34:26,938
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you should probably go then.

1424
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:32,374
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye, now.

1425
01:34:39,493 --> 01:34:44,608
Look, that's not until later,
so if you wanted to,

1426
01:34:46,206 --> 01:34:48,764
we could go for
a walk or something?

1427
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,674
Okay.

1428
01:35:07,185 --> 01:35:09,253
Come on, keep up.

1429
01:35:09,343 --> 01:35:13,332
It's these shoes.
I can't mountain climb in brogues.

1430
01:35:13,419 --> 01:35:17,693
It's not K2. It's just a big hill, all right?
A child could do it.

1431
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:26,525
I don't want you thinking I'm bothered
or anything about last night.

1432
01:35:26,606 --> 01:35:30,595
I don't want your phone number,
or letters, or postcards.

1433
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:32,432
I don't want to
get married to you.

1434
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,906
Definitely don't want
to have your babies.

1435
01:35:34,997 --> 01:35:37,828
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we've had today.

1436
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:46,624
And if we should bump into each
other sometime in the future,

1437
01:35:46,706 --> 01:35:48,615
well, that's fine, too.

1438
01:35:49,862 --> 01:35:51,658
We'll be friends.

1439
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,736
Yeah, right.

1440
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:03,126
Or, you know,
on the other hand...

1441
01:36:05,607 --> 01:36:06,833
Go on.

1442
01:36:08,684 --> 01:36:11,514
Well, my parents
don't arrive until later.

1443
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:14,557
So?

1444
01:36:14,638 --> 01:36:17,865
So, well, the flat's empty.

1445
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:22,825
You know, if you wanted
to finish what we started.

1446
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:26,104
What? Sober?

1447
01:36:26,466 --> 01:36:27,659
Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:36:28,863 --> 01:36:30,500
And in daylight.

1449
01:36:34,937 --> 01:36:35,925
Race you!

1450
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:54,270
Do you want a piggy-back,
you old man?

1451
01:36:54,358 --> 01:36:58,347
It's these shoes.
There's no blooming grip on these things.

1452
01:36:58,434 --> 01:37:00,229
Here, come here, you.

1453
01:37:04,787 --> 01:37:05,980
Did you come up here with Emma?

1454
01:37:06,106 --> 01:37:07,254
Yeah, once.

1455
01:37:07,345 --> 01:37:09,538
That was a long time ago now.

1456
01:37:10,662 --> 01:37:12,093
Do you miss her?

1457
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,618
Well, of course, I do.

1458
01:37:14,817 --> 01:37:18,329
She was...
She was my best friend.

1459
01:37:18,414 --> 01:37:20,448
Who's your best
friend now then?

1460
01:37:20,572 --> 01:37:23,561
Well, you are, of course.
Come here.

1461
01:37:24,767 --> 01:37:26,404
Why, who's yours?

1462
01:37:27,645 --> 01:37:29,951
I think it's probably Mum.

1463
01:37:33,838 --> 01:37:34,906
Yeah.

1464
01:37:37,155 --> 01:37:38,950
I'm not so
terrible though, am I?

1465
01:37:39,113 --> 01:37:40,908
I'm not answering that.

1466
01:37:45,347 --> 01:37:47,222
You know what you are.

1467
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:16,196
It's just round the corner.
This way.

1468
01:38:17,355 --> 01:38:18,423
Oh, Dexter!

1469
01:38:18,514 --> 01:38:20,309
Damn it, they're early.

1470
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,736
You're early.

1471
01:38:23,828 --> 01:38:26,101
We thought we'd surprise you.

1472
01:38:26,186 --> 01:38:27,856
Clearly, we have.

1473
01:38:29,982 --> 01:38:32,369
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley.
Morley.

1474
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:33,777
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

1475
01:38:33,858 --> 01:38:35,972
Emma, you'll join us
for tea, yes?

1476
01:38:36,056 --> 01:38:39,250
No, no, thanks.
I should leave you to it.

1477
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:41,844
Are you going to go?
Yeah. Well,

1478
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:44,482
pleasure to meet you and...

1479
01:38:44,568 --> 01:38:46,954
Well, have a nice life.

1480
01:38:47,045 --> 01:38:48,193
Okay.

1481
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:57,068
I'm sorry. Did we
just interrupt something?

1482
01:38:57,195 --> 01:39:01,025
No, no.
Emma's just a good friend.

1483
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:03,786
Weren't you
wearing this yesterday?

1484
01:39:04,508 --> 01:39:05,825
The rascal.

1485
01:39:11,501 --> 01:39:13,171
Emma! Em!

1486
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:16,009
Em, wait! Wait, wait.

1487
01:39:17,615 --> 01:39:20,648
Look, I need your phone number.

1488
01:39:20,731 --> 01:39:24,038
My number?
Right. Of course.

1489
01:39:24,128 --> 01:39:25,639
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of that.

1490
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:29,352
I wasn't expecting them until after we...
Well, you know.

1491
01:39:30,641 --> 01:39:31,834
Right.

1492
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:33,992
This is me in Edinburgh.

1493
01:39:34,118 --> 01:39:35,391
Right.

1494
01:39:36,356 --> 01:39:38,106
My parents' number

1495
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:41,387
and their address just in case.

1496
01:39:41,471 --> 01:39:42,743
Right.

1497
01:39:43,349 --> 01:39:45,224
Oh. Dad's got
a fax machine at work.

1498
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:47,977
Just the phone number's fine.

1499
01:39:48,064 --> 01:39:49,291
Thank you.

1500
01:40:20,392 --> 01:40:21,460
Look, I've got to go.

1501
01:40:21,551 --> 01:40:22,618
I know.

1502
01:40:25,347 --> 01:40:26,824
But we will see
each other again.

1503
01:40:27,025 --> 01:40:28,503
I know we will.

1504
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:32,294
Goodbye, Dex.

1505
01:40:32,619 --> 01:40:33,937
Goodbye.

1506
01:40:35,217 --> 01:40:36,444
Goodbye.
