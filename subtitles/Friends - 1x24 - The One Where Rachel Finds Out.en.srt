3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,641
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

4
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,962
You're going out with a guy.

5
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,521
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,723
All right, Joey, be nice.

7
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,532
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

8
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,366
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

9
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,644
I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

10
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,405
Okay, everybody relax.

11
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:18,449
Relax. This is not even a date.

12
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:22,480
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

13
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,971
Sounds like a date to me.

14
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,451
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

15
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,684
. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

16
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,850
I've had that dream.

17
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,721
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

18
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,125
. . .there.

19
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,004
-Instead of--
-That's right!

20
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,811
That one, I've never had.

21
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:52,204
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

22
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,290
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,363
They weren't looking at you before?

24
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,725
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

25
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,332
And it turns out it's my mother.

26
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:10,326
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

27
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:22,531
This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

28
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,281
You okay, sweetie?

29
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:29,803
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

30
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,725
-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

31
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,171
Carol moved out today.

32
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,328
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

33
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:47,526
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

34
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,447
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

35
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,922
Fine. Be murky.

36
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:56,284
I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

37
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,447
No, you don't.

38
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,728
To hell with her. She left me!

39
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,127
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

40
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:11,451
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

41
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,526
She didn't know.
How should I know?

42
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,932
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

43
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,728
Did I say that out loud?

44
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,522
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.

45
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:33,970
Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. . .

46
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,442
. . . ''I'll never have grandchildren! ''

47
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,728
Was, what? A wrong number?

48
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:40,731
Sorry.

49
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:44,164
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

50
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,721
You're angry. You're hurting.

51
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,122
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

52
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,606
Strip joints!

53
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,922
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

54
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,322
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

55
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,330
I just want to be married again.

56
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,843
And I just want a million dollars!

57
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:13,921
Rachel?

58
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,561
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

59
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:19,724
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

60
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,207
. . .that you might be here and you are.

61
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,524
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

62
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,968
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

63
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,732
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe. . .

64
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,167
. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

65
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:36,322
Sure!

66
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:50,130
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

67
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:56,128
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

68
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:58,840
I was in this room with
all the presents. . .

69
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,128
. . .and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

70
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,722
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

71
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:07,321
When all of a sudden I realize--
Sweet 'N Low?

72
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,848
I realized. . .

73
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:13,687
. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

74
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,565
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

75
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:19,326
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

76
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,925
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

77
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,923
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

78
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,602
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

79
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:37,050
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

80
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,931
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

81
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,770
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

82
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,925
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

83
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,242
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

84
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,926
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

85
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:07,481
''Tuna or egg salad?''

86
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,847
''Decide! ''

87
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:13,723
''I'll have whatever
Christine is having. ''

88
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:18,169
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

89
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,171
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,926
I just don't love him.

91
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,682
Well, it matters to me!

92
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:33,325
''If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off. ''

93
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,445
She should not be
wearing those pants.

94
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,763
I say push her down the stairs!

95
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,606
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

96
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,444
Come on, Daddy, listen!

97
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:54,487
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

98
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,407
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

99
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,564
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

100
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:04,248
What if I want to be a purse?

101
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,726
Or a hat?''

102
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:09,041
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

103
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,328
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

104
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,321
You can see where he'd have trouble.

105
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,763
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

106
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,324
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

107
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,330
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

108
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,522
Well, maybe that's my decision.

109
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,728
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

110
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,729
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

111
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,565
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

112
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,121
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

113
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:55,042
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

114
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:59,205
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

115
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:03,362
La la la something
And noodles with string

116
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,728
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

117
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,125
I helped.

118
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:13,447
This is probably for
the best, you know?

119
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,852
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

120
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,650
The whole ''hat'' thing.

121
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:23,044
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

122
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,443
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

123
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,726
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

124
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:33,532
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

125
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,327
I got it.

126
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,923
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

127
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,730
It's Paul.

128
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:47,248
Oh, God. Is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

129
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,926
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

130
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:50,928
Maybe.

131
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:54,289
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

132
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,409
He finally asked you out?

133
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,091
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

134
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,005
Rach, I can cancel.

135
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,607
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

136
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:06,446
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

137
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,325
That'd be good.

138
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:15,287
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

139
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,925
Does he sell it, drink it,
or he just complains a lot?

140
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,562
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

141
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,847
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

142
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:32,161
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

143
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,804
I'll be right back.
I've just got to go a--

144
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,923
A-wandering?

145
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,127
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

146
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:50,328
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

147
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,042
Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip.

148
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:00,250
She likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot. . .

149
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:03,689
. . .over and over again, till
it starts to get a little red.

150
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,723
Shut up, Joey!

151
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,443
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

152
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:14,966
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

153
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:16,725
. . .so, nothing.

154
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,529
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

155
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:26,323
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

156
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,771
. . .big lizards.

157
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,611
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

158
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,730
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

159
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,321
And we're very excited about it.

160
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:45,005
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

161
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,521
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

162
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:48,687
Pheebs, wanna help?

163
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:51,207
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

164
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:05,725
Love is sweet as summer showers

165
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,651
Love is a wondrous work of art

166
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:13,807
But your love, oh, your love
Your love

167
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,729
Is like a giant pigeon

168
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,447
Crapping on my heart

169
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:26,331
Thank you!

170
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,971
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

171
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,522
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

172
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:47,529
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

173
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,650
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

174
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:54,961
We got a bookcase here.

175
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,123
It's a beautiful thing.

176
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,240
What's this?

177
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,882
I would have to say that is
an L-shaped bracket.

178
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:08,526
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

179
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,687
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

180
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,126
This was Carol's favorite beer.

181
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,524
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

182
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,567
If you start with that,
we're out of here.

183
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:32,605
Please don't spoil all this fun.

184
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,086
Let me ask you a question.

185
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:38,530
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

186
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:39,767
What did you get?

187
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:41,522
You guys.

188
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,563
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

189
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,328
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

190
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:52,764
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

191
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,082
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

192
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,522
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

193
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,165
How did you get through it?

194
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,768
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

195
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,286
-Say her--
-Leg?

196
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,483
That's one way of going through it.

197
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,491
Me, I went for the watch.

198
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:13,410
You actually broke her watch?
The worst thing I ever did was. . .

199
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:16,530
. . .I shredded my old boyfriend's
favorite bath towel.

200
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,411
-Steer clear of you!
-That's right.

201
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,970
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

202
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:28,127
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

203
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,926
It's about me.
And I just--

204
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,285
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

205
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:49,762
I know that some girl is going to be
lucky to become Mr. Barry Finkel.

206
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,163
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

207
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:58,327
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is
right now, but give me a chance to--

208
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,811
I'm divorced!

209
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,963
I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.

210
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,123
Shut up.

211
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,528
That only took me an hour.

212
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:20,322
Between us, we haven't had a
relationship last longer than a Mento.

213
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:26,489
You, however, have had the love
of a woman for four years.

214
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,929
Four years of closeness and sharing.

215
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,850
After which,
she ripped your heart out. . .

216
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,322
. . .and that is why we don't do it.

217
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,922
I don't think that was my point.

218
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,125
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

219
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:46,523
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

220
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:51,408
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

221
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,329
What are you talking about?
One woman.

222
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,368
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

223
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:04,321
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

224
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:08,611
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

225
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:13,683
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

226
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:16,326
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

227
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,245
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

228
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,921
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

229
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,561
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

230
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,929
Then stay out of my freezer.

231
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,643
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

232
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,769
What? What?

233
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,242
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

234
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:44,882
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

235
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:49,050
So there's going to be a fifth date?

236
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,248
Isn't there?

237
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,368
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

238
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,328
What were you going to say?

239
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,682
Ever since she left me. . .

240
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,962
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

241
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,531
. . .sexually.

242
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,611
Oh, God! Oh, God!

243
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:15,921
I'm so sorry.

244
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:19,528
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

245
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,608
How long?

246
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,168
Two years.

247
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,525
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

248
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,723
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

249
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,731
Yeah, I do.

250
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,923
We are gathered here
to join together...

251
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:46,642
...Joanie Louise Cunningham...

252
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:51,329
...and Charles Chachi,
Chachi, Chachi...

253
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:55,371
...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

254
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,921
-Marriage is the most sacred--
-See!

255
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:02,723
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

256
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,410
''Grab a spoon. ''

257
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,843
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

258
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:13,323
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

259
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:20,201
Great story. But I gotta go.

260
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,285
I got a date with Andrea.

261
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,524
Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

262
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:29,003
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

263
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:32,244
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

264
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,528
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

265
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,524
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

266
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,528
. . .who am I going to ask?

267
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,520
Isn't this amazing?

268
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,962
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

269
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,601
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

270
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:16,242
I figure if I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

271
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:21,124
I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do. ''

272
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:26,130
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

273
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:31,761
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

274
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,802
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

275
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,443
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

276
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,170
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

277
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,131
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

278
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,160
Thank you.

279
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,811
-Thank you so much.
-Stop!

280
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,371
Last night was like. . .

281
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:02,968
. . .all my birthdays, graduations, plus
the barn-raising scene in Witness.

282
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,326
We'll talk later.

283
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,531
Thank you.

284
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,722
That wasn't a real date.

285
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:29,326
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

286
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,128
Shut up and put my table back.

287
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:36,250
I've got to get to work.

288
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:41,327
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

289
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:47,127
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

290
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,964
Yeah, we all have jobs.

291
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,680
That's how we buy stuff.

292
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:56,126
Yeah, I'm an actor.

293
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,722
Have I seen you in anything?

294
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,167
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

295
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:05,041
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

296
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,322
. . .at the Little Theater in the Park.

297
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,211
It was a job, all right?

298
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,922
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

299
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,564
I will not take this abuse.

300
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,723
You're right. I'm sorry.

301
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,924
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

302
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,880
You should both know that
he's a dead man.

303
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,330
Oh, Chandler!

304
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:34,207
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

305
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:37,922
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

306
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:41,722
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

307
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:50,050
I know. He's just so--

308
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,089
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

309
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,331
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

310
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,681
-Are you in trouble!
-Big time!

311
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,242
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

312
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,325
We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

313
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:12,922
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

314
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:16,131
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

315
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,010
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

316
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:21,403
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

317
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,567
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

318
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,245
How was Florida?

319
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,722
You had sex, didn't you?

320
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,608
How do you do that?

321
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:43,525
I hate you. I'm pushing my
aunt through Parrot Jungle. . .

322
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:45,205
. . .and you're having sex.

323
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,924
So, who?

324
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,931
You know Paul?

325
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,929
Paul, the wine guy?

326
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,360
Yeah, I know Paul.

327
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,247
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

328
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,687
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

329
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:05,726
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

330
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:11,327
Of course it was a line.

331
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:14,286
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

332
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,524
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

333
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,529
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

334
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:22,962
I hate men. I hate men!

335
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,806
Don't hate. Don't put that out
in the universe.

336
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,765
Is it me?

337
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:32,527
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

338
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,161
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

339
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:37,209
Come here.
Give me your feet.

340
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:46,642
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

341
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,923
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

342
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:58,448
Guess what?

343
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:00,529
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

344
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,404
I'm trained for nothing.

345
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:06,083
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

346
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:07,765
You're surprisingly upbeat.

347
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,322
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

348
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,210
. . .50% percent off.

349
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,170
How well you know me.

350
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,761
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

351
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,003
I've got great boots,'' boots.

352
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,443
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

353
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:27,604
And who pays for that?

354
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,203
My father.

355
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,523
Come on, is this necessary?

356
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,563
I can stop charging any time I want.

357
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:39,768
You can't live off your parents.

358
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:43,561
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

359
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,282
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

360
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:49,125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

361
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:51,971
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

362
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,970
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

363
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,123
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

364
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:01,763
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

365
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:03,604
And then he killed himself.

366
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:08,209
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

367
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,927
The word you're looking for is:

368
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:15,761
''Anyway. . . . ''

369
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:21,966
You ready?

370
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,407
No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?

371
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:27,246
''You ready to jump out of
the plane without a chute?''

372
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:28,481
I can't do this.

373
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,723
-I know you can.
-I don't think so.

374
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:33,532
You made coffee.
You can do anything.

375
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:38,009
Cut, cut, cut.

376
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:44,530
You know what?

377
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:48,401
We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.

378
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:50,449
That was a library card.

379
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:01,528
If you listen very closely, you can
hear a thousand retailers scream.

380
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,170
Welcome to the real world!

381
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:08,926
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

382
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,923
That's it.

383
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,525
You gonna crash on the couch?

384
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:24,526
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

385
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,810
Look what I just
found on the floor.

386
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:30,961
What?

387
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,250
That's Paul's watch.

388
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,926
You can just put it back
where you found it.

389
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:38,928
Oh, boy! All right.

390
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:41,722
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

391
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,168
-I'm sorry.
-No!

392
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:55,926
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

393
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:04,720
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

394
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:06,968
. . .a major crush on you.

395
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,527
I knew.

396
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,331
You did?

397
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:16,402
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

398
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,931
I did.

399
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:24,564
Listen, do you think--

400
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:28,930
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

401
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,920
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

402
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:38,440
Maybe.

403
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,723
Okay, maybe I will.

404
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,729
-Good night.
-Good night.

405
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:08,931
See you.

406
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,042
Wait, wait.

407
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,361
What's with you?

408
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:18,128
I just grabbed a spoon.

409
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,205
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

410
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,010
I can 't believe
What I'm hearing

411
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:32,322
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

412
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,048
Would you stop?

413
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:36,524
Was I doing it again?

414
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:42,644
I said that you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

415
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,606
You wouldn't know a great
butt if it bit you.

416
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,331
There's an image.

417
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,523
Would anybody like more coffee?

418
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,044
Did you make it?

419
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,531
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

420
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,686
Kids, new dream.

421
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,047
I'm in Las Vegas.

422
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,486
Miss, more coffee?

423
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:08,329
Excuse me? Could you give this
to that guy over there?

424
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:10,651
Go ahead.

425
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,007
Thank you.

426
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:14,328
Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

427
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,290
So I'm in Las Vegas.

428
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:19,530
I'm Liza Minnelli.

The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

4
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:47,327
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

5
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:50,291
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna. . .

6
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,881
. . .I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

7
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,084
The meat's only every third layer.

8
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,890
Maybe you could scrape.

9
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,610
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

10
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:05,725
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass. . .

11
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,528
. . .and I could find my way
out like that!

12
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,007
This is cool.

13
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,608
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

14
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,083
And we're done with the yogurt.

15
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:21,808
Sorry.

16
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,723
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

17
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,566
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

18
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,082
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

19
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,404
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

20
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,525
Ross, listen.

21
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,605
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

22
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,968
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy. ''

23
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,448
Hello.

24
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,725
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,163
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

26
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,370
''What's a lesbian?''

27
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,490
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

28
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:10,122
It's like ''poke a nose. ''

29
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,884
Poke a nose.

30
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,491
So did I hear ''Poconos''?

31
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,962
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

32
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,480
First weekend away together.

33
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,922
-Yeah, it's a big step.
-I know.

34
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,365
It's just a weekend.
Big deal.

35
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,132
Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

36
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,885
Shouldn't it be. . .

37
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,885
. . .flung by now?

38
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,524
We are way past the ''fling'' thing.

39
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:48,481
I'm feeling things I've only
read about in Danielle Steel books.

40
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,690
When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally. . . .

41
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,492
Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

42
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,888
What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

43
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,450
I could call Immigration.

44
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:11,128
I love babies with
their little baby shoes. . .

45
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:15,166
. . .and their little baby toes
and their little hands. . . .

46
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,482
You're gonna have to stop that. . .

47
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,568
. . .forever.

48
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:29,885
Need a new table.

49
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,687
You think?

50
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,047
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,407
I brought the books. . .

52
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,287
. . .and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,887
Great!

54
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:50,290
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

55
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,482
I'm pretty sure that it is.

56
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,165
So I got the results
of the amnio today.

57
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,600
Tell me.
Is everything. . .?

58
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,165
Totally and completely healthy.

59
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,681
That's great! That is great!

60
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,486
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

61
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,688
That's our friend Tanya.

62
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,082
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

63
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,765
Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

64
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:31,766
The sex?

65
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:37,288
I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

66
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,807
But when you throw in Tanya. . . .

67
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,488
The sex of the baby, Ross.

68
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,041
You know it?

69
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,890
Do you want to know?

70
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,282
I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

71
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,205
I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there. . .

72
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,283
. . .and see,
''Oh, there it is. . . ''

73
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,291
. . .or isn't.

74
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,282
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,328
So?

76
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,366
So did you hear?

77
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,563
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-OK.

78
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh, that's so cool!

79
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,806
It really is.

80
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,287
Do we know?

81
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,285
We certainly do.
It's going to be a--

82
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,522
Hello?

83
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,366
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

84
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:30,324
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

85
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:38,245
What. . .?

86
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,920
What did we think it'd be?

87
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,687
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know.

88
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,729
I should probably just go.

89
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,288
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.

90
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,767
Susan.

91
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:03,204
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

92
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,088
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

93
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,524
So just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

94
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:17,568
That's the rule.

95
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,124
What rule?
There's no rule.

96
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,771
If anything, you owe me a table.

97
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:23,928
How did you get that?

98
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,009
This piece of furniture
was fine. . .

99
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,931
. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

100
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:30,807
You knew about that?

101
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:34,448
The impressions you made in the butter
left little to the imagination.

102
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,690
How about if we split it?

103
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,643
What do you mean,
like, buy it together?

104
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,690
Do you think we're ready for that?

105
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:45,888
Why not?

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,090
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

107
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,128
-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

108
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,646
You'd tell me if you were?

109
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:59,048
-It's just, with my last roommate--
-I know all about Kip.

110
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,289
We bought a hibachi together,
then he ran off and got married. . .

111
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:03,368
. . .and things got ugly.

112
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,283
Let me ask you something.

113
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,051
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

114
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:09,848
Don't do that.

115
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,649
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

116
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:22,009
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,130
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

118
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,481
Thanks.

119
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,646
Here comes your 3:00.

120
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,525
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but-- Yum!

121
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,291
Paolo! Hi!
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,608
Rachella tell me you. . .

123
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,162
. . .massage?

124
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,927
Well, Rachella's right.

125
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,963
I don't know what you said,
so let's start.

126
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,567
I am. . .

127
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,449
. . .being naked?

128
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:04,960
That's your decision.

129
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,367
Some people prefer to take off--

130
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,521
Being naked!

131
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,924
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I couldn't not know.

132
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,642
If the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--

133
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,722
And Monica knows.

134
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,091
How could you?
I don't even know.

135
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,129
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.

136
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,885
I asked. She told me.

137
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,605
So what's it going to be?

138
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:33,450
Great! Now he knows
and I don't know.

139
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:35,882
I'm sorry. I'm excited
about being an aunt.

140
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,281
Or an uncle.

141
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:45,688
Fine!

142
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:49,802
What's the matter?

143
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,890
Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

144
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,123
Can we get some
cappuccino over here?

145
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,284
Oh, right! That's me!

146
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,730
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

147
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,087
Fine.

148
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,887
What is it?

149
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:09,408
You know Paolo?

150
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,921
I'm familiar with his work.

151
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,406
He made a move on me.

152
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:17,561
-The store'll be open tomorrow.
-More coffee.

153
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:26,206
What happened?

154
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,124
He came in for a massage. . .

155
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:30,283
...and everything was fine until....

156
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:35,288
My God!

157
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:36,601
Are you sure?

158
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,881
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

159
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:47,281
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

160
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,128
Was it. . .?

161
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,886
Boy Scouts could've
camped under there.

162
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:58,411
''Ooh,'' what?

163
00:10:58,652 --> 00:10:59,687
--ma Thurman.

164
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,883
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

165
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:04,048
Thanks, Rach.

166
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,850
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

167
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,481
You have to! It's your
moral obligation as a friend. . .

168
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,324
. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.

169
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,085
Guys? Guys?

170
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,004
You have to tell her.

171
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,571
Feminist issue?
That's where I went.

172
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,726
She is gonna hate me!

173
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,528
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

174
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,046
Here, how about that one?

175
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,683
That's patio furniture.

176
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:37,968
So what?

177
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,448
Like people will come in and think,
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''

178
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,687
Fine.

179
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,890
What about the birds?

180
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,731
I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .

181
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,611
. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''

182
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,085
You pick one.

183
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,606
How about the ladybugs?

184
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:58,811
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

185
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,162
Fine! Do you want the birds?
Get the birds!

186
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,090
Not like that, I won't.

187
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,520
Kip would've liked the birds.

188
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:19,728
Hi, Pheebs.

189
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,082
Are you moving out?

190
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,288
No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

191
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:24,885
This one's Paolo's.

192
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,284
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

193
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:32,368
Sure.

194
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,881
Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.

195
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:49,803
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

196
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,968
There are three things
you should know about me.

197
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,404
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

198
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,490
Two, I never lie.

199
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,807
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

200
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,208
Thanks, Pheebs.

201
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,765
My God!

202
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,008
Why have I never tasted these before?

203
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:21,921
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

204
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,730
You're right. These are
the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

205
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,411
Which proves that I never lie.

206
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,330
I guess you don't.

207
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,171
Paolo made a pass at me.

208
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,691
So what do you think?

209
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,287
It's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

210
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,362
I know.

211
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,730
So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?

212
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,451
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.

213
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:51,448
Come on!

214
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:54,727
Heads up, Ross.

215
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:56,202
Score!

216
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,601
You suck!

217
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,880
Are you okay?

218
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,081
I need some milk.

219
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:09,726
I've got milk.

220
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:15,888
Here you go.

221
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:24,968
Better?

222
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,086
I feel so stupid!

223
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,728
I think about the other day
with you guys.

224
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:39,328
And I was all,
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

225
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,085
He makes me feel so--''

226
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,087
God!

227
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,205
I'm so embarrassed!

228
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,646
I'm the one he hit on.

230
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,410
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.

231
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,330
If I had never met him,
this would never--

232
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,568
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

233
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,202
Wait!

234
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,688
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

235
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,843
Right. He's the pig.

236
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,691
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

237
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:08,202
He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .

238
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:10,647
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

239
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,211
But he was my pig man!

240
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,922
How did I not see this?

241
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,527
Oh, I know!

242
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,766
Because. . .

243
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,925
. . .he's gorgeous.

244
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,685
And he's charming.

245
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,400
And the way he looks at you--

246
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,522
The end.

247
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,282
God!

248
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,288
Should I not have told you?

249
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,249
Trust me, it's much better
that I know.

250
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,166
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

251
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,446
I think she took it pretty well.

252
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,043
Paolo's over there right now, so. . . .

253
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,083
We should go
and see if she's okay.

254
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,482
Just one second.

255
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,608
Score!

256
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,165
Game! Us!

257
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:25,122
Come on.

258
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,770
It looks like
we kicked your butts.

259
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:30,927
She kicked our butts.

260
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,845
You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

261
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,367
Come on. Two on one.

262
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:38,086
Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.

263
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,645
It's time for you to swoop in.

264
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:41,888
What, now?

265
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,121
Now is when you swoop.

266
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:47,682
When Paolo walks out of there,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

267
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,282
She's got to know
you're everything he's not.

268
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,488
You're like the anti-Paolo.

269
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,044
My Catholic friend is right.

270
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,483
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

271
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,724
You pick up the pieces, and then
you usher in. . .

272
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,691
. . . ''The Age of Ross. ''

273
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:13,805
Hold it! Ascolta!

274
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,649
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

275
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,207
She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

276
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,528
Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.

277
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:27,248
That is either, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts! ''

278
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:29,928
Here he comes.

279
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,080
I am. . .

280
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,091
. . .to say goodbye.

281
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,081
Okay, bye-bye.

282
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,564
I hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

283
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,490
But I still have five of these. . .

284
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,121
. . .so heat it at 375
untiI the cheese bubbles.

285
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,291
I just wanna tell you. . .

286
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,922
. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .

287
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,891
Just look at her.

288
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,885
Guys, I think only one of us
should go out there. . .

289
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,923
-. . .so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

290
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,088
And I really think it should be me.

291
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,048
You all right?

292
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,290
I've been better.

293
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:48,201
Come here.

294
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,048
Listen. . .

295
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:59,684
. . .you deserve
so much better than him.

296
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,808
I mean, you. . .

297
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,682
. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

298
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,528
What?

299
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,086
I'm so sick of guys!

300
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,808
I don't want to look
at another guy.

301
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,088
I don't want to think
about another guy.

302
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,290
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

303
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,483
Ross, you're so great.

304
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,371
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

305
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,491
Medium.

306
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,684
Any cookies left?

307
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:52,887
See, Rach. . .

308
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,370
. . .I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

309
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:02,043
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

310
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,092
I just need to be
by myself for a while.

311
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,004
I just gotta
figure out what I want.

312
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:14,565
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

313
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:16,490
No, I know. I know.

314
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:20,480
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

315
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,088
What?

316
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,168
What?

317
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,401
I'm having a boy?

318
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,925
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

319
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,084
I'm having a boy.

320
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,601
Am I having a boy?

321
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,283
You're having a boy!

322
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,926
I'm having a boy!

323
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,127
I'm having a boy!

324
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,128
-What?
-What is it?

325
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,367
I'm having a boy!

326
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:52,930
We already knew that!

327
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,685
I'm having a son.

328
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,610
And that would be a shutdown!

329
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,006
Shutout!

330
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,766
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game!

331
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,883
It's 2:30 in the morning.

332
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:19,087
Get out!

333
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,325
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

334
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,927
Come on, I'll only use
my left hand.

335
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,128
Come on, wussies!

336
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,888
All right! Okay!
I gotta go!

337
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,487
I'm going.

338
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:36,285
And I'm gone.

339
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:39,888
One more game?

00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,743
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,698
Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:11,099
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:14,907
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,946
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,699
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:27,344
Pardon?

8
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:30,507
Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.

9
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:38,859
Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'II pay you back.

00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,421

Really, I'II pay you back this time.

14
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,899
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,424
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

16
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,186
What kind of research?

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,945
Just, you know, science.

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,301
Science.

19
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,185
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,227
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,106
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

22
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,302
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,784
I just go down there
every other day. . .

24
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,100
. . .and make my contribution
to the project.

25
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,063
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

26
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,902
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

27
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,338

of formally cute cows and turkeys.

31
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,907

00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,862
Cute, cute!

36
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,343
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

37
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,627
So how are things going?

38
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:54,383
Is she becoming your special someone?

39
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,108
I don't know.
She's pretty great.

40
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,506
What does she think of
your Little science project?

41
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:07,098
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

42
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,307
The man's got a point.

43
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:16,025
The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

44
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,099
Crazy bitch!

45
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,425
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .

46
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,298
. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .

47
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:31,942
. . .if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,224
Joey, we always know what you mean.

49
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,705
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna Last?

50
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,417
I'm going to China.

51
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,425
Jeez, you say one thing and. . . .

52
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,383
You're going to China?

53
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,182
It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

54
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,344
They don't want us
to have the bone.

55
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,627
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

56
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,343
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

57
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:09,901
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,302
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:18,867
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,223
Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,187
I'm your father.

62
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,504
I am The Head!

63
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,300
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

64
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,184
Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I Left.

65
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,504
She's out having drinks with Carl.

66
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,101
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,903
You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:53,141
-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,627
So you do know who he is.

70
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,416
You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,458
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

73
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,420
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

74
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:22,781
Do you guys know who Carl is?

75
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,220
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore. . . .

76
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,103
Rachels having
drinks with him tonight.

77
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,822
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

78
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,021
Forget about her.

79
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:41,108
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

80
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,016
Of course, there,
they just call it food.

81
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,946
I guess. I don't know.

82
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,906
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

83
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,504
We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

84
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,423
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

85
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm still on my first.

86
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,060
I just think you're nice.

87
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,737
That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

88
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,908
We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''

89
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,302
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
only with fruit.

90
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,742
-How do you Like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:38,937
Hold on there, tiger.

92
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,182
How are you holding up?

93
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,742
Well, not so good.

94
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,338
She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight. . .

95
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,822
. . .if you know what I--

96
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,343
And you do!

97
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,026
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

98
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:54,901
What do you mean?

99
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,269
You know, just be there for her.

100
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,302
Not following you.

101
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,307
Think about it.

102
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm guessing this is from. . . .

103
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,706
Well, thank you, Melanie.

104
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,105
This one right here is from me.

105
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,708
It's light.

106
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,303
It rattles.

107
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,497
It's. . .

108
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,303
. . .Travel Scrabble!

109
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,504
Thank you.

110
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,937
This one's from Joey.

111
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,661
It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.

112
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,259
And it's a book!

113
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:51,978
It's Dr. Seuss!

114
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,978
That book got me through
some tough times.

115
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,343
There is a Little child
inside this man.

116
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,346
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

117
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,139
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross' .

118
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,502
Oh, my God!

119
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,096
He remembered!

120
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,497
Remembered what?

121
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,137
It was months ago.

122
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,704
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

123
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,420
I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.

124
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,978
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,504
It's so pretty!

127
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,142
This must've cost him a fortune.

128
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,464
I can't believe he did this.

129
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,899
Remember when he
fell in Love with Carol. . .

130
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,499
. . .and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

131
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,703
What did you say?

132
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,148
Crystal duck.

133
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,626
The ''Love'' part?

134
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,701
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,418
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

136
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,500
That'll turn back time.

137
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,264
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

138
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,023
I know.
This is really, really huge!

139
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:49,547
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

140
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,543
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

141
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,376
Is there a mute button
on this woman?

142
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,820
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

143
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,342
Did you have any idea?

144
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,147
No, none!

145
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,426
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out. . .

146
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,102
. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .

147
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:14,307
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

148
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,341
Given that he's desperately
in Love with you. . .

149
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,500
. . .he wouldnt mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

150
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:21,702
Ross?

151
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,941
AII this time?

152
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,304
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

153
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,663
The country.

154
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,062
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

155
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,385
-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

156
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,623
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

157
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:40,898
What'll you say to him?

158
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't know.

159
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,504
Then maybe you shouldnt go.

160
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,224
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

161
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,379
But if it's good news,
tell him now.

162
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,067
Maybe I'II know when I see him.

163
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,702
Here, look.
AII right, does this help?

164
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,097
AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

165
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,697
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

166
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,143
I'II see you Later.

167
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,225
I Love you!

168
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,902
Deal with me first!

169
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:26,825
AII right.

170
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,227
Excuse me, pardon me.

171
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,504
Your boarding pass?

172
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,546
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

173
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,537
Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

174
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,785
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

175
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:46,865
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

176
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,942
AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

177
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,587
This is very important.

178
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,019
AII right.
What's the message?

179
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,706
I don't know.

180
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:00,817
Excuse me! Sir!

181
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,342
Excuse me! Sir?

182
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,147
I have a message for you.

183
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,302
Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

184
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,702
What?

185
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,147
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

186
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,788
There's no Rachel!

187
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,100
Don't give me that deep freeze!

188
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:30,697
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

189
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,301
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

190
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,307
It was nothing.

191
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,898
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

192
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,381
You know what?

193
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,979
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

194
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,663
Me, again?

195
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,099
Sure. Why not?

196
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,379
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

197
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:14,546
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.

198
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,658
How do you mean?

199
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:21,099
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, ''Me, me, me! ''

200
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,225
But you. . .

201
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,258
. . .you're a giver.

202
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,943
You're, Like, the most generous
man I ever met.

203
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,419
I mean, you're practically a woman.

204
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,268
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,697
It's only a Little torn.

206
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:45,020
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

207
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,107
I don't know.

208
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,942
I don't know.

209
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,938
I thought about it
all of the way there. . .

210
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,306
. . .and I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .

211
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,140
You know, it's Ross!

212
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,499
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,903
-Sure!
-Sure.

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,907
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling. . .

215
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,701
. . .but I'm thinking. . .

216
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,062
. . .it'd be really great.

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,705
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Like friends-in-law!

218
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,822
The best part is you already
know all about him.

219
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,184
It's Like starting on the 1 5th date.

220
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,698
But it would be Like
starting on the 1 5th date.

221
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,341
Another good point.

222
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,740
At the 1 5th date, you're already
in a ''relationship-py'' place.

223
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:36,943
You're committed.

224
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,504
What happens if it doesn't work out?

225
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,783
Why isn't it working out?

226
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,667
Sometimes it doesn't.

227
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,339
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

228
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,538
No, I'm just--

229
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,148
Maybe there's someone else.

230
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,299
Is there?
Is there someone else?

231
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,109
No, there is no one else.

232
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,908
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

233
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,302
Hey, big--

234
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,625
Spender!

235
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:17,027
She's still asleep.

236
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,577
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

237
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,740
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

238
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:25,339
The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.

239
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,621
Well, Last night
I couldnt do the thing. . .

240
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,706
. . .that usually makes me great.

241
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,899
So I had to do
all this other stuff.

242
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,106
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

243
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,340
It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!

244
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,658
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

245
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,702
It was amazing,
and not just for her.

246
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:52,745
For me too!

247
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,947
It's Like, all of a sudden
I'm blind. . .

248
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,139
. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.

249
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,899
You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .

250
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,059
. . .on another level.

251
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,864
I didn't know you had
another Level.

252
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,145
I know. Neither did I!

253
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,498
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

254
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,107
-From who?
-From you!

255
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,822
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

256
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,506
Well, it's the thought.

257
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,702
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

258
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,660
At gate 27B?

259
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,139
I've been thinking about it.

260
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,664
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

261
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,664
Why?

262
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,144
Because I feel Like I wouldnt
just be going out with him.

263
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,504
I would be going out with
all of you.

264
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,148
There'd be all this pressure and--

265
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,106
No pressure, no pressure!

266
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,667
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

267
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,143
I'm not ''so. ''

268
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,504
I was a teensy bit weird at first. . .

269
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,701
. . .but I'II be good.
I promise.

270
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,419
Who is it?

271
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,942
It's me, Carl.

272
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,223
Come on up.

273
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,101
Behind my brother's back?

274
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,223
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

275
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,304
Seven hundred bucks!

276
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,339
AII right, you did it!

277
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,942
Do we have any fruit?

278
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,700
Man! A hell of a two weeks.

279
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,861
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

280
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,583
So you'll stick with this
''it's all for her'' thing?

281
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:51,301
What, are you crazy?

282
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,906
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around Like this?

283
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:04,703
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr. . .

284
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,705
. . .in that stupid electric car. . .

285
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,228
. . .I'II shoot myself!

286
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,340
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se. . .

287
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:15,787
. . .it's just that guy!

288
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,704
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

289
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,307
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

290
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,859
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

291
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,338
Can't do it, can you?

292
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,338
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

293
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:37,625
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

294
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,057
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

295
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,267
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

296
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,541
Rachel, come on.

297
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,700
Give us a chance.

298
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,902
It's too hard.

299
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,346
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

300
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,545
Who cares?
This is about us.

301
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,105
I've been in Love with you
since the ninth grade.

302
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,909
-You're, Like, my best friend.
-I know.

303
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,861
If we broke up, and I lost you--

304
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,787
Why do you think
we'll break up?

305
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,703
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

306
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:14,984
No.

307
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,503
But it only has to happen once.

308
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,747
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

309
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:23,943
Right?

310
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,740
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

311
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,017
I don't know.

312
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,906
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

313
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,188
Well start Looking!

314
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,617
Exactly!

315
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,705
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy. . .

316
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:55,701
. . .caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

317
00:19:58,189 --> 00:19:59,337
Right!

318
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,738
You're right!

319
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,544
You know what?

320
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,986
I forgot, I need to pick up
a friend at the airport.

321
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,144
I am so sorry!

322
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:11,506
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

323
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,176
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!

324
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,583
But. . . .

325
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,065
Excuse me! Pardon me!

326
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,098
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,538
Toby. . .

328
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,700
. . .for God's sake,
will you Let it go?

329
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,540
There's no Rachel!

330
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:40,903
I got that!

331
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,505
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

332
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,699
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends!

333
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,548
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

334
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,102
No, they will.
I just. . . .

335
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,338
-Can't wait!
-Can't wait!

336
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,704
Come on, they're gonna Love you.
