- No. Something's wrong.

Call 911.

6
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:16,578
Hey, uh,
my ex is having a heart attack,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,082
or my prayers are being answered.

8
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:22,384

<i>Christy, come here.</i>

10
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:28,790
- What's he saying?
- I'd rather not repeat it.

11
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,820
- So, he'll be okay?
- Yeah. I should think so.

12
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,562
You'll probably
be able to take him home tomorrow.

13
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:36,264
Oh, thank God. That's great news.

14
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,666
For you.

15
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:41,436
He's gonna need to take it easy
for a couple of weeks.

16
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:43,605
Is there somebody
available to provide care?

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,775
What are you looking at me for?

18
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,778
I've got a full-time job,
and I'm gonna have to deal with Violet.

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,088
No. I am not doing it.
No, no, no.

20
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,622
No.

21
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:05,260
Oh, my God. She still loves him.

22
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:09,030
You have no idea how funny this is.

23
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:21,876
- What?
- Just thinking about God.

24
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,446
- What about him?
- He is just such a scamp.

25
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,784
He puts Alvin back into our lives.
That's good.

26
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:32,520
Gives him a heart attack.
That's bad.

27
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:34,522
But makes you realize
you still love him.

28
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:36,991
- What?
- And that's good.

29
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:39,760
I don't love him.
I despise him.

30
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:42,029
Uh-huh.
Keep telling yourself that.

31
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,732
I have no feelings for your father.

32
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:48,402
- God begs to differ.
- Leave God out of this.

33
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:53,174
- Woe unto thee who denieth his will.
- Stop that!

34
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,811
Thy kingdom come, et cetera.

35
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,882
Your father abandoned
me after you were born.

36
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:05,986
- How could I ever love that bastard?
- Don't ask me.

37
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,054
Ask the scamp.

38
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:12,393
Seems to me the moment Alvin's
heart stopped beating...

39
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,928
yours started.

40
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,064
That's it.

41
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,267
Get out.
You're walking home.

42
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,871
- The house is right there.
- Okay. Stay in.

43
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:26,073

Oh, don't remind me.

Would you keep Roscoe quiet
while I grab a quick nap?

49
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,781
- I am exhausted.
- Sure.

50
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:55,616

Oh, my God.
Where have you been?

52
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,023
- My water broke.
- Okay. Okay. Uh, stay calm.

53
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:07,227
- Here we go.
- We need a new bathroom rug.

54
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,696
- How was your nap?
- Bite me.

55
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:17,237
- Roscoe?!
- What?

56
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,106
- Why aren't you wearing pants?
- I was relaxing.

<i> Son of a bitch!</i>

That's the nicest thing
she's said in the last hour.

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,425
- The doctor's in with her now.
- Cool.

62
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,661
Oh. Hey, buddy. You want to
go hang out with your old dad?

63
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,296
I want to stay and see the baby.

64

Roscoe, we talked about this.

65
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,201
I don't care.
I want to see the baby.

66
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:51,070
Let me explain it to him.

67
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,941
Look up at me and nod like
I'm saying something smart.

68
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,510
How we doing, Doc?

69
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,812
She's three centimeters,
so we still have a little time.

70
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,714
Okay.

71
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,450
Why don't you go check on
Alvin and I'll hang with Violet.

72
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,353
Why don't YOU go check on Alvin
and I'll hang with Violet.

73
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:12,124
'Cause she's my daughter
and he's your long-lost lover.

74
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:17,563
Do you want to go to ICU?
Because it's right there.

75
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:21,234
Ah. Bring it!
Come on. Show me what you got!

76
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:24,303
Okay. I have rounds.

77
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,608
- But I was gonna be an uncle.
- Hey. I was gonna be the voice

78
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,177
of an animated character
in a Pixar movie.

79
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:36,949
<i>But things don't always work out.</i>

80
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:38,250
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm talking about waking
up one day and realizing

82
00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:44,256
that you've wasted your
life chasing stupid dreams.

83
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,128
You got to get ready for that.

84
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,966
Somehow we forgot to
bring your toothbrush,

85
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,267
but I can run downst...

86
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:58,003
- What are you doing?
- I'm going home.

87
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,840
- You're kidding, right?
- Mm-mm. I'm not doing this.

88
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,443
Now, where are my freaking shoes?

89
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,514
I don't understand.
Is this about the adoption?

90
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,150
No. I don't want to have the baby.
It's gonna hurt!

91
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:14,186
You're just figuring that out now?

92
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,488
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

93
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,124
I can breathe at home!
Now, let's roll!

94
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:24,463
Hmm.
Morphine.

95
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,333
Now I want a heart attack.

96
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,906
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,508
Did you come back to finish the job?

98
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,213
Don't be silly.
I like seeing you weak and diminished.

99
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:46,118
- Still, thanks for coming to visit.
- Eh... don't flatter yourself.

100
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,887
I'm only here 'cause Violet's upstairs
having the baby.

101
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,756
Oh... right. How's she doing?

102
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,058
She's fine.
She's surrounded by loved ones.

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,762
Speaking of which,
where's your wife and children?

104
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,396
I haven't told them yet.

105
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:02,534
- Why not?
- I don't want them to worry.

106
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,704
Well, don't expect me to, either.

107
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,841
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't.

108
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:16,047
Shh...

109
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:21,720
go to the light.

110
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:27,725
You shouldn't be sad.
You have lots of reasons to live.

111
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,995
- Like what?
- Um...

112
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:33,031
give me a second.

113
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:36,868
- Damn it, Violet. Get back in bed!
- No! I want to go home!

114
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,604
Sweetie, even if you leave the hospital,
that baby is still coming out.

115
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,706
Not if I hold it in.
Now, get out of my way!

116
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,460
I will not!
Now, you need to get in bed

117
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:48,579
- and just let things happen.
- That's how I got here.

118
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,416
Okay. Well, that's a
conversation for another time.

119
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:52,850
Come on. Lay down.

120
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,837
It's not fair.
My friend Rachel had

121
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:57,188
sex with her boyfriend,
and she didn't get pregnant.

122
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,758
She even had sex with Alissa's
boyfriend and didn't get pregnant.

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,428
My only takeaway from all
that is that Rachel's a slut.

124
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:05,429
Oh. Okay. All right.

125
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:06,898
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

126
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,633
Ooh. I have an idea.

127
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,834
What are you doing?

128
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,603
I'm making a video for you to watch

129
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,839
the next time you think
about having unprotected sex.

130
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,909
That's not funny.

131
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,045
Look at the camera.
Look at the camera.

132
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:31,021
- Enough?
- Yeah. Thanks.

133
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:34,825
So, ever think in a million years
you and I'd be together like this?

134
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:38,379
First of all, we're not together.
And secondly, I have

135
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,799
dreamed of standing over
your dying body for decades.

136
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,737
So, you dream about me?

137
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:51,909
Listen, the doctor said this
was a small heart attack,

138
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,044
but if the big one's coming...

139
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:55,946
I need you to know how sorry I am.

140
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,449
Oh, please. Spare me
the deathbed confession.

141
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:01,652
I can't. Running out on
you when Christy was born

142
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,088
was the stupidest thing I've ever done.

143
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,890
And... I'll never forgive myself.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,162
- That was a long time ago, Alvin.
- So, you forgive me?

145
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:17,167
- Would that give you peace?
- Yeah.

146
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,572
Then I'm gonna say...

147
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,808
<i>...suck it.</i>

148
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:35,185
If it matters at all, I...
had my will rewritten

149
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,788
to include you and Christy and the kids.

150
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:44,094
Really?
Signed and filed?

151
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,531
Yeah.

152
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,869
<i>Shh...</i>

153
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,338
go to the light.

154
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:58,775
You know, when your mom
kicked me out, I thought,

155
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:02,412
"Okay. I'm free.
I can party.

156
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:05,515
I can date lots of girls.
It's all good, right?"

157
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,484
Sounds good.

158
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:12,455
It's not.
It's lonely out there, kiddo.

159
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,290
And I am not getting any younger.

160
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:20,684
Living in my van is
getting less cute everyday.

161
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,465
You're still cute, Dad.

162
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:28,471
Thanks.
But we both know I'm borderline creepy.

163
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,010
Would ice cream make you feel better?

164
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:38,181
Couldn't hurt.
Come on. Let's go.

165
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,383
You got any money?

166
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:45,264
Shouldn't Luke be here by now?

167
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:47,567
He was too high to
drive, so he took the bus.

168
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,637
He smokes pot on the day
you're having the baby?

169
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't make a big deal about it.
He smokes pot every day.

170
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,610
- Violet?
- There he is.

171
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,545
- Luke?
- Where are you?

172
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:00,680
I'm in here.

173
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,848
- I'm coming, baby.
- Luke!

174
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,152
In here!

175
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,586
<i> Violet?</i>

176
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:09,188
You just walked past me.

177
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,222
<i> Violet...!</i>

178
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,924
Luke!

179
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:14,527
<i> Violet...!</i>

180
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,762
"Every day," you say?

181
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,966
All right, Mr. Biletnikoff,

182
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,835
- everything's looking good.
- Thanks, Doc.

183
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,670
Be back to check on you in the morning.

184
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,505
- Mrs. Biletnikoff.
- I'm not Mrs. Biletnikoff.

185
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:29,574
Mrs. Biletnikoff left him
for a a guy on Facebook.

186
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:34,880
Okay.
Try to stay calm.

187
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:40,853
Hey. I push this button,
and the nurse is here in a second!

188
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,290
Relax. I'm just fluffing.

189
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:49,094
- Okay. Thank you.
- Mmm.

190
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:53,332
And I've decided...
to accept your apology.

191
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,635
- Really?
- Yeah.

192
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:58,437
It's time to move on.

193
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,440
Thank you, Bonnie.
That means a lot to me.

194
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,042
Forget about it.

195
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,190
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

196
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,993
You know, my heart's not
strong enough for sex.

197
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,985
Don't tempt me.

198
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,761
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh.

199
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,696
- Thanks for getting here so fast.
- Of course.

200
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,764
- Hi.
- Hey.

201
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,832
How's Violet?

202
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,001
Oh, you know,
a little crazy, a little mean.

203
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,170
But nothing that'll be passed down.

204
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,774
We brought some gifts for her.

205
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,443
I found a couple nice tops
and some cool earrings.

206
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:56,012
Yes, the earrings are cool.

207
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:58,348
That's very thoughtful.

208
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,918
- Is there anything we can do?
- I think we got it covered.

209
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,854
Unless you know how to do an episiotomy.

210
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,258
I-I don't.

211
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,960
- She's kidding.
- Oh.

212
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:15,031
Christy, something
amazing just happened.

213
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,332
- Is the baby born?
- Is the baby here?

214
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,168
Oh, no. Hi, hi.
Good to see you.

215
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,491
No, I was just making
out with Christy's father.

216
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,140
You scamp.

217
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,709
Please, uh, excuse me for a second.

218
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,444
What happened to hating his guts?

219
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,846
Oh, no, I don't think
I ever said "hate."

220
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:33,449
You said it, you sang it, you
bought an unregistered handgun.

221
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,753
<i>Violet!</i>

222
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:47,897
So...
how you feeling?

224
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,901
- Much better.
- Yeah.

225
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,437
That's what I hear.

226
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:57,507
- She told you.
- Yep.

227
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,509
I don't know what to
say. It just happened.

228
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,615
You... have any thoughts as
to where this goes from here?

229
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,416
You got me.

230
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:11,516
Right before we kissed,
she tried to kill me.

231
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,210
<i>Twice.</i>

232
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:19,528
All right, well,
you're both grown-ups.

233
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,906
I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your lives.

234
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:23,933
- Thanks.
- But here's the thing.

235
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:30,139
She's just a few months sober
and still pretty raw.

236
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,108
- You know, emotionally.
- I get it.

237
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,645
- Very fragile.
- Right.

238
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:40,449
Five-eleven in flats
and crazy as a bag of rats.

239
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,285
That's the girl I fell in love with.

240
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,823
Oh, my God, we're at nine centimeters.

241
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,425
- I got to go.
- Go, go, go.

242
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,461
I'm really glad you're okay.

243
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,966
<i>Violet, this isn't funny anymore!</i>

244
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,073
You're doing very well.
Let's try another push.

245
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:10,412
- I changed my mind.
- I told you,

246
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,015
you can't go home.
You're having the baby.

247
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,550
No, I want to keep it.

248
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,353
You want to keep the baby?

249
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,590
I'm never going through this pain again,
so I have to keep this one.

250
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,824
Well, what about the Taylors?

251
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,560
Tell them I am sorry,
but I changed my mind.

252
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,162
Violet, you're in a
lot of pain right now,

253
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,530
so you might want to wait till after...

254
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,332
This is my baby.
I am keeping it!

255
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,802
Okay. Um...

256
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:36,505
<i>- What do I do?
- No idea.</i>

257
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:41,009
<i>- Do I go tell the Taylors?
- I think you got to.</i>

258
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,411
<i>- You want to do it?
- Hell no.</i>

259
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,313
<i>- Please?
- No.</i>

260
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,049
<i> You suck.</i>

261
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:53,421
Oh, hey.
You guys can't find her, either?

262
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:57,525
- No, she's right down the hall.
- Oh. Weird.

263
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,258
Excuse me.

264
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,967
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna hang with you.

265
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,704
- Please.
- Thanks.

266
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,639
Oh, listen, now that I got you here,

267
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,708
I want to run a couple
baby names by you.

268
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,611
- Oh, okay. Sure.
- If it's a boy...

269
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,880
Smokey.

270
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,316
Smokey?

271
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,385
Smokey Taylor. Who doesn't
want to be Smokey Taylor?

272
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:27,522
- You know, it's not that bad.
- Oh, no.

273
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:33,895
Now, if it's a girl...
Smokey.

274
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:39,634
- Hey.
- Is it here?

275
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:43,171
No, no, no baby yet.
Um...

276
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:46,307
there has been a development, though.

277
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,910
Here, uh, why don't you sit down.

278
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:52,747
- Is she okay?
- She's fine. Um, the thing is...

279
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,715
- Where the heck did you go to?!
- What?

280
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:57,618
<i>She changed her mind again.</i>

281
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,355
- Really?
- Really.

282
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:09,463
Uh...
looked like a breech birth,

283
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,199
but then the baby did
a little somersault,

284
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,870
stuck the landing.
You need to start thinking gymnastics.

285
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:22,343
- Olympics 2032.
- USA! USA! USA!

286
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,482
Smokey Taylor for the gold.

287
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:32,953
- What the hell happened?
- The minute you walked out, she freaked

288
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:35,589
and started yelling that she
wasn't ready to be a mother.

289
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,625
How do we know she's not gonna
freak and change her mind again?

290
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,227
- We don't.
- I just hate this.

291
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:41,929
<i> Hey, Bonnie.</i>

292
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:48,635
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, God.

293
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:52,673
- How's Violet?
- She's doing okay. How are you doing?

294
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:57,544
- I'm cool, I'm cool.
- Yeah, you are.

295
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,964
I hate to break this up, kids,

296
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,800
but your great-grandchild
is about to be born.

297
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,954
- I'll be up to check on you later.
- Right on.

298
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,093
- Oh, God, his gown is open.
- Yeah, he's showing off.

299
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,267
You did great, honey.

300
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,868
Thanks.

301
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,704
You were so brave.

302
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:28,275
How come my stomach's not smaller?

303
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:32,446
Didn't anyone tell you?
You're gonna be fat forever.

304
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,417
It just... takes some time.

305
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,653
Would you like to hold your daughter?

306
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,125
You don't have to, honey.

307
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,096
No.
I want to say good-bye.

308
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,707
Hey there, little girl.

309
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:07,247
I just want you to know
that I'm doing this for you

310
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:10,483
and that you are gonna
have a wonderful life

311
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,619
with your new mom and dad.

312
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:18,925
And they are gonna love you so much.

313
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,934
- I don't know what else to say.
- You said it.

314
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:32,338
I love you.

315
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,040
I love you, too.

316
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,067
Hi. I'm Christy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

317
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,702
<i> Hi, Christy.</i>

318
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:08,206
Today I'm one year sober.

319
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,745
And I'd like to say it was
the best year of my life.

320
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:19,850
But the truth is it was
a 365-day crap storm,

321
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,087
starting with the woman
I hated most in the world

322
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:26,891
coming back into my life.
Mom, take a bow.

323
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,497
But I didn't drink.

324
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:38,369
My teenage daughter got pregnant,
and I still didn't drink.

325
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:43,107
And then I met two
incredible women here,

326
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:48,445
both of whom I truly love
and look up to.

327
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:53,183
One got cancer, and...
the other one went to jail.

328
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,652
Marjorie?

329
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,625
Cancer.
Jail sends her love.

330
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:05,796
And then I tracked down
my Dad, who I'd never met.

331
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:08,932
And we actually started
to build a relationship.

332
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:10,601
<i>Aw.</i>

333
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:11,735
He just had a heart attack.

334
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:13,137
<i>Oh.</i>

335
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,938
And my Mom made out
with him in the hospital.

336
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
<i>Ooh.</i>

337
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,546
And then yesterday,

338
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:26,049
my daughter gave her
baby up for adoption.

339
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:29,519
And that had
to be the hardest thing

340
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,855
I've experienced in my life.

341
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:36,460
But I didn't drink.
Didn't even think about it.

342
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,896
Okay, I thought about it, but...
I didn't want to.

343
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:42,199
Okay, I wanted to.

344
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,235
But I didn't do it.

345
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,941
It's funny. I thought...

346
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,644
I got sober and my life fell apart.

347
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:58,882
But what really happened was
I got sober just in time.

348
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:02,711
So... thank you.

00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,129
I'm thinking about going vegan.

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,416
Really? Why?

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:11,128
Diet, health,
compassion for animals.

4
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:14,589
I am not happy with
how my urine smells.

5
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,037
Then stop smelling it!

6
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:21,304
Oh! Don't look!

7
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,602
Don't smell, don't look...
you're bossy today!

8
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:27,942
- Isn't that the chef from your restaurant?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,534
- He's kind of cute.
- No! He's not!

10
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,222
Everyone at work 
is terrified of him.

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,822
How scary can he be?
He's carrying a purse.

12
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:37,945
Hey! Hello there.

13
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:38,920
<i>Damn!</i>

14
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,118
Hi!

15
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,048
Chef Rudy, good to see you.

16
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:47,748
Good to see you, too...
I wanna say... Meredith?

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,699
- Christy.
- Right. And your mother Bonnie.

18
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,736
I work with you every day,
and her you remember?

19
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:01,370
Does a thirsty man forget
a tall glass of water?

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,880
May I join you?

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,300
Sure.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,510
So, my daughter tells
me everyone at work

23
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:10,720
is frightened of you.

24
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,670
Ooh, that's very sweet.
Thank you.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,090
So, what kind of naughtiness

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,760
is the mother-daughter
team up to today?

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,430
Don't go there.

28
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:24,140
Mmm, too late.
Mental snapshot. Click.

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,940
We've just come back
from the drugstore,

30
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:29,990
where we bought some, you know...

31
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,640
- girl stuff.
- Click.

32
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,620
What are you up to today?

33
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:39,530
Oh, just blowing
the dust off my spyder.

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,650
- Beg pardon?
- I have a vintage Porsche Spyder.

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,920
She's high-strung, impulsive,

36
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,490
and if I don't ride her hard

37
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:47,840
at least once a day,
she misbehaves.

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,660
I'm the same way.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Click.

40
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,170
Aw, all out of film.

41
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:59,170
Yeah. I will bid you adieu.

42
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,510
<i>A la prochaine.</i>

43
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,720
Yeah, I just know "adieu."

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,450
Tell me you haven't tapped that.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,230
- Of course not.
- Good.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,170
Can I ask you a little friendly advice

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,910
vis-à-vis my personal affairs?

50
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,310
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

51
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,880
Great. What are my chances
of bedding your mother?

52
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,500
What?

53
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,090
I felt there was chemistry between us.

54
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,560
But I feel that with a
lot of women, often with

55
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,290
disastrous results.

56
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:55,810
Fun fact: Pepper spray
tastes nothing like pepper.

57
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,130
All right, look...

58
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:04,070
I don't want to get
involved here, but...

59
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:07,690
I will tell you she was
quite taken with you.

60
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:09,660
Oh, I knew it.

61
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:13,360
When I walked out of that coffee
shop, my testicles were on fire.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
You might want to get those looked at.

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,000
That's what I'm trying to do.

64
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,620
Be a dear, get her on the phone for me.

65
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,800
Okay, but I got to warn
you about my mother.

66
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,720
There's a little crazy
up in them thar hills.

67
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,470
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know what they say,

68
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,390
"nothing soils the sheets like crazy."

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,720
How are you allowed to touch food?

70
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,950
Hi, Mom, it's me.

71
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm probably going
to regret this, but...

72
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,040
He's right here.

73
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,474
Hey, you.
Been ridden hard yet, today?

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,300
Aah, clickety-click, click, click.

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,230
Is Grandma having dinner with us?

76
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,730
- No, she's got a date.
- Cool. You know the guy?

77
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:25,270
- I do.
- So, do you think they'll hit it off?

78
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm thinking murder-suicide.

79
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:31,390
It's so weird to think
of your Grandma dating.

80
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,240
My Grandma weighs 300
pounds and has one leg.

81
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,140
Well, doesn't mean there's
not someone

82
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:39,076
- out there for her.
- That's true.

83
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,250
My Grandfather would sure
love it if she met somebody.

84
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,500
Oh, I'll get it.

85
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,930
Well, Grandma will be easy
to spot at the wedding.

86
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,440
- Well, you must be Violet.
- No, I-I'm Luke.

87
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:02,420
Well, you're very pretty, nonetheless.
Bonnie here?

88
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:05,360
Uh, she's getting ready.
Come on in.

89
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:08,030
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,530
Well, I had you pegged
for a house on wheels.

91
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:15,200
That's the dream.
Can I get you something to drink?

92
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,290
I wouldn't mind a glass of Pinot Grigio.

93
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:20,120
I wouldn't mind a bucket of Gin.

94
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:23,660
But, uh, all we've got
is tap water and milk.

95
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:26,500
Mmm. I'll pass.
What am I smelling?

96
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,000
- I made dinner.
- No, that can't be it.

97
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,050
Do you have pets?

98
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,340
It's corned beef and cabbage.

99
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh, yes, poor people food.

100
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,180
My apologies.
It smells delicious.

101
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,130
Ready to go?

102
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:46,557
Oh, well, there's a tasty morsel.
Yum, yum.

103
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,570
- Thank you.
- He's gonna eat her?

104
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,600
- Shall we?
- Did you bring the Spyder?

105
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,310
- Freshly lubed for your pleasure.
- Ooh! Bye, family.

106
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:00,739
- Have fun.
- Are we poor people?

107
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:05,370
Of course not.
Now, eat your boiled meat.

108
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,840
Wow, that was quite an education,

109
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,590
watching a master Chef
shop for groceries.

110
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,850
Well, I think it's
important to feel and smell

111
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,430
the things we put inside us.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,455
I got to tell you, if I'm smelling it,
I'm not feeling it.

113
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,520
So, um, what are we having?

114
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,280
Well, it's a tasting menu that I call

115
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:35,950
"seven small explosions in your mouth."

116
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,350
Seven, huh?
Let's see.

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,540
Salty, sweet, savory, sour...

118
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:50,250
- help me.
- Crunchy, creamy and Rudy.

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,050
Ooh.
What's Rudy taste like?

120
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,890
Pistachios, I've been told.

121
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,890
Mm.

122
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:03,060
But the real magic happens
when we start to combine flavors.

123
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:07,350
For example,
take a simple cherry tomato.

124
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:12,230
Squirt a little aged balsamic
vinegar into its fleshy center.

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,490
"Cherry," "squirt," "fleshy."

126
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:19,490
- You can't help yourself, can you?
- It's very hard.

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,780
Mmm!

128
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:30,700
That's not sweet like a
tomato or sour like vinegar.

129
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,670
Exactly.
It's a third thing that didn't exist

130
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,810
until one was driven
deep inside the other.

131
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,270
And yes, I know what I just said.

132
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,270
Where'd you go to culinary school?

133
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,100
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

134
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,690
A Denny's in Boston.

135
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,610
I worked the late shift;
there's a lot of time to screw around.

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,360
- Where's the Boston accent?
- I dropped it.

137
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,980
Hard to charge 60 bucks

138
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:01,280
for lobster chowder with capers.

139
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,620
Ah. Yeah.

140
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:05,790
Well, where are my manners?
Can I get you a glass of wine?

141
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:09,290
- No, thank you. I don't drink.
- Never?

142
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,940
- Never.
- Impressive.

143
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,780
How is it that you have
not killed yourself?

144
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:18,470
I'm more of a homicide girl.

145
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:22,450
Well, then, as a good host,
I won't drink, either.

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,760
Ah, who am I kidding?

147
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,100
- So, why do you abstain?
- I'm allergic to alcohol.

148
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,320
Every time I drink,
I break out in handcuffs.

149
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,520
<i>Mm.</i>

150
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:39,800
Pity.

151
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,910
I have a rather remarkable collection
of wine and handcuffs.

152
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:46,182
You know, next to great food,

153
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,480
beautiful women and vintage cars,

154
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:51,330
wine is what brings
me the most happiness.

155
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,670
No, actually, it's women, then food...

156
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,920
No, wine, women...
ah, I left out pills.

157
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,840
- It's pills, wine...
- I get the point.

158
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,600
Let's see how sophisticated
your palate is. Hmm?

159
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,000
Put on this blindfold.

160
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:12,170
Well, I usually charge 50
bucks extra for that, but okay.

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
I knew I liked you.

162
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,810
- And... you ready?
- Do it.

163
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,850
- What do you taste?
- Mmm. Fig?

164
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:31,410
Very good.
Now, try this.

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,210
Mmm.

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,410
Eel?

167
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,080
And here comes the pistachios.

168
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,510
Morning.

169
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,789
- Walk of shame?
- Stride of pride.

170
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,490
Did you consider, for even a minute,
to go slow with this guy?

171
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:15,090
See a movie,
shop at the flea market,

172
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,990
text him a picture of your boobs.

173
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,890
You know, like a lady.

174
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,410
- I did think about it.
- And?

175
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,700
I chose instead to do him
on the floor of his kitchen.

176
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,570
What is wrong with you?
Don't you have any self-respect?

177
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:33,670
Oh, please. Self-respect is for
women who spend Saturday night

178
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,090
alone with their
showerhead set on pulse.

179
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,380
That's a terrible thing to say.

180
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,940
And I happen to have
a stiff neck from work.

181
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:48,610
Did it ever occur to you
that what happened last night

182
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:51,690
between me and Rudolph was the
start of something wonderful?

183
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,310
Oh, wake up!

184
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:56,150
It's a one-night stand
between a middle-aged alcoholic

185
00:10:56,185 --> 00:11:00,870
- and a sex addict.
- How dare you call me middle-aged?

186
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,450
And it was not a one-night stand.

187
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,610
Rudy and I are two ingredients,
which, when combined,

188
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,960
create a third thing which...
never existed before.

189
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,050
What the hell are you talking about?

190
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,670
I don't know!
It's a tomato thing!

191
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,890
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go take a shower.

192
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
To clean myself.

193
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,930
You'll never be clean!

194
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,660
So, are we gonna talk about it?

195
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,067
Well, I was gonna be a gentleman

196
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,580
and spare you the details,
but as you wish.

197
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:47,810
Your mother is sleek yet powerful,
like an enormous greyhound.

198
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Yeah, great.
Not what I want to talk about.

199
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:54,120
I... I just want to put it out there

200
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:58,130
that no matter where your
relationship goes with her,

201
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:02,130
you and I maintain
a professional relationship here.

202
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:04,780
Okay, two things wrong
with that, Meredith.

203
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,600
First of all, you and I don't have
a professional relationship.

204
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,670
I'm a world-class Chef,
and you are a waitress.

205
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:15,560
And no offense, but I would
be just as happy to put my food

206
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:20,030
on a tiny toy train that
choo-choos into the dining room.

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,370
And secondly,
I have absolutely no plans

208
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:27,400
to pursue a relationship
with your mommy.

209
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,070
What?

210
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,660
I thought the two of
you made "a third thing".

211
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,700
With a tomato.

212
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,470
No, that's just my rap when I'm
trying to filet some panties.

213
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,700
Oh.

214
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,230
So, you're not planning
on seeing her again?

215
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,880
Oh, god, no.
Well, never say never.

216
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,900
Can't have a Russian hooker every night.

217
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,320
I don't believe this.
What kind of a man are you?

218
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,560
Well, selfish, narcissistic,

219
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:07,830
emotionally crippled by
a cold and distant mother.

220
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,900
You know, the usual.

221
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,250
She's gonna be devastated.

222
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,340
Well, then you better
break it to her gently.

223
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,170
I'm not gonna tell her.

224
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:20,240
Wow, that seems cruel.
But your call.

225
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,180
- What's going on?
- That pig slept with my mother.

226
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,630
Welcome to the club.

227
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,390
- Hey.
- Hey.

228
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,860
- Roscoe asleep?
- Yup.

229
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,200
- What'd you do tonight?
- What do you care?

230
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry about this morning.

231
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,620
Really?
So, you admit that Rudy and I

232
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,410
are capable of having
a meaningful relationship?

233
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,630
Well...
I admit that I love you.

234
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,220
All right, what's going on?

235
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
Rudy's done with you.

236
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,640
Well, why are you
telling me instead of him?

237
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
Because...

238
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:15,180
he was emotionally
crippled by his mother.

239
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,650
And, you know...
he's a giant douche.

240
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,190
- Wow, so I completely misread him.
- I'm so sorry.

241
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,490
No, you warned me.
I'm a big girl.

242
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,140
I should have known better.

243
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,080
Look at me, giving myself a pedicure

244
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,920
so that jerk could suckle
on a pretty red toe.

245
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,870
Is that his thing?

246
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:43,240
Oh, yeah, he's got a mouth
like a Chinese finger trap.

247
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,840
My fault, I asked.

248
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,510
All right, I'm gonna
take a quick shower.

249
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
Say hi to your "boyfriend."

250
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,510
I would, but after he saw
you naked, we broke up.

251
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,730
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,180
Not gonna do anything crazy?

253
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,780
Oh, come on, go take a shower.

254
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,230
<i>Okay.</i>

255
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,040
It's like she doesn't know me at all.

256
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Yes, I want a medium meat lover's
pizza with cheese in the crust.

257
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,650
Yes, and some crazy bread.

258
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,910
- Hello, Rudolph.
- Bonnie.

259
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,070
<i>How'd you get in my house?</i>

260
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Oh, please. Who sleeps with a man
and doesn't steal his spare keys?

261
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,620
- Okay. What do you want?
- What I want is to hurt you.

262
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:05,170
But not physically, because...
you might like that.

263
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:08,210
But on an emotional level,
like you hurt me.

264
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:10,590
No, you are barking up
the wrong tree, sister,

265
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,880
because I stopped feeling years ago.

266
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:16,180
Really?
We'll see.

267
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,050
Hmm.

268
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:23,660
"1957 Château Latour."
Ooh, sounds fancy.

269
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,950
Thank you.

270
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,900
And for my next trick,

271
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,290
I will attempt to juggle
three bottles of...

272
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,990
ooh, Montrachet.

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Oh, ooh, ooh.

274
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,170
Aw.
I'm not very good.

275
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,140
<i>Okay, I lied.
I didn't just get clean.</i>

276
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,910
Mom?

277
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,480
<i>Mom?</i>

278
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,780
Oh, damn it!

279
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
No.

280
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,870
And this Mouton Rothschild
is for little Jimmy,

281
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,630
who's sick in the hospital.

282
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,680
Please, no more.

283
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:36,592
And this Château Montelena

284
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,770
is for all the wine snobs
and their nutty top notes.

285
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,770
Enough! Stop!

286
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,770
I can't take it anymore.

287
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,360
Good.
Come to me.

288
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,980
Oh, my god, you're magnificent.

289
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,180
Now what?

290
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,360
Suckle.

291
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,340
Hello?

292
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,230
Oh, my god, I'm too late.

293
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:28,880
<i>Ah, ah, oh, yeah, Bonnie,
right there, wicked hard!</i>

294
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,220
Who the hell is that?

295
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,250
- Mmm.
- Oh, my god.

296
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:52,160
This duck pâté is so much
better than corned beef.

297
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:55,290
Yeah, and the house won't
smell like a thousand egg farts.

298
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,810
Hello.

299
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,570
Oh, hi, Chef Rudy.
Thanks for the picnic basket.

300
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, I know it's not for me.

301
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,360
What's up?

302
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:13,280
Hang on, let me see if she's here.

303
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:18,810
She's not here.
Can I take a message?

304
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,950
Oh, s-slow down, let me grab a pen.

305
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,540
Go ahead.

306
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,180
"The... the dark, violent turn

307
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,630
our love play took
last night haunts me""

308
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:45,510
Wait, say again?

309
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,633
"The wine cork will remain where it is

310
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:52,120
as a sign of my commitment".

311
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:58,777
All right, I'll be sure
she gets the message.

312
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:02,894
Of course I won't tell
anyone at the restaurant.

313
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,254
Bye-bye.

314
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:14,035
I think someone's sweet on you.

It's very good.

00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:21,622
Yeah, 2004 was a great
year for this wine.

Not so much for me.

10
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:27,427
Enjoy.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,269
So, did I talk you into that soufflé?

12
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:38,472
- Uh, yeah, two.
- Good call.

13
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:40,541

♪ And many more.  ♪

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,840
Hm...
More butter and salt.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,442
They only need to live long
enough to pay the check.

Beat those egg whites gently...

24
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:21,748
as if they were a small, annoying child.

25
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,553
Paul, you're on fire again.

26
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,525
Um, Christy, you got a second?

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,761
I can't talk now, Gabriel.
I'm working.

28
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:36,363
Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing.

29
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:38,432
I-I'm getting a lot of complaints.

30
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,935
Really?
About what?

31
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,004
Well, apparently, one of my waitresses

32
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,175
- is having a nervous breakdown.
- Is it Jennifer?

33
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,880
- No.
- Is it Carol?

34
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:53,947
It's you!

35
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:56,617
Gabriel, what does
this taste like to you?

36
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,655
- Uh, mushrooms?
- The correct answer was "ass."

37
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,828
Listen, uh, maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

38
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:11,098
I can't afford to do that.
I have children to feed.

39
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,367
Not a problem. Grab a couple
steaks, head home and feed 'em.

40
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,203
You don't understand.

41
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:18,972
The guy at table 4 said
something horrible to me

42
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,308
when I was telling him about the salmon.

43
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:24,077
- What's wrong with the salmon?
- Nothing, the salmon's great!

44
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:27,414
- The guy insulted me.
- Oh, that's fine.

45
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,285
- What did he say?
- He said I was...

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,254
"a good waitress."

47
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,327
That's not bad.
Or true.

48
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,365
I didn't grow up to
be a "good waitress""

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
That was never the plan.

50
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,702
The plan was to be a psychologist.

51
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:50,904
Okay.
You're a young woman.

52
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,675
- You can still do that.
- Yeah, maybe.

53
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,011
I'd probably have to
graduate high school first.

54
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:03,083
Now all I've got to look
forward to is serving $60 risotto

55
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,385
to a bunch of smug food Nazis.

56
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,221
I mean, who are we kidding?

57
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:12,025
It's a big, steaming
pile of gooey rice!

58
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:21,602
- What did you say?
- Get over yourself, Rudy.

59
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:25,239
I saw you at McDonald's
going down on a Big Mac.

60
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,745
First of all,
it was a Filet-O-Fish.

61
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,751
- And for you?
- Um, I'd like the, uh...

62
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:41,822
I'd like the, uh,

63
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:44,791
the pounded capon with,
uh, lemongrass and thyme.

64
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,328
Excellent choice.
You know...

65
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,964
that's a castrated chicken
they beat with a hammer.

- Hi.
- I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,242
That's okay.
How was work?

78
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:11,879
Oh, fun.
I feel guilty taking the money.

79
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,832
What'd you do tonight?

80
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,834
Not much.
Did my homework, watched TV.

81
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,004
Mmm.
Is there a TV on your ceiling?

82
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,074
What?

83
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,843
Sit down.
We need to talk.

84
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,515
What's up?

85
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,686
Violet, I can't tell you...

86
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,589
not to have sex at your age,
because I had sex at your age.

87
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,458
Mom, I'm not having sex.

88
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,928
Don't lie to the woman
who washes your sheets.

89
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,131
And in case you've forgotten,

90
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,133
I got pregnant with you
when I was a teenager.

91
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,270
And please don't take
this the wrong way:

92
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:58,076
- It ruined my life.
- I love you, too, Mom...?

93
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,611
And I can't tell you not
to drink and smoke pot,

94
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,780
because my senior yearbook quote was:

95
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,783
"Let's drink and smoke pot""

96
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:09,654
- Can this please be over?
- You don't know how lucky you are.

97
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,990
My mother never bothered to
talk to me about this stuff.

98
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,758
- Yeah, this is over.
- Honey, I just don't want you

99
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,194
to wake up one day and feel bad
'cause you're not a psychologist!

100
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,696
Okay, good talk!

101
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:26,170
Let's get you back in your own bed.

102
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,307
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

103
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:32,910
- I waited up for you.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,548
- Violet's boyfriend was over.
- I know.

105
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,584
They were kissing.

106
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:42,286
I'm sure they were.

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,222
They took a shower together.

108
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,359
Terrific.

109
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,529
Are you coming to my
talent show tomorrow?

110
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:54,365
Tomorrow?
What time?

111
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,767
11:00.

112
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,302
Oh, honey, I have to
work the lunch shift.

113
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:01,472
It's okay.
I'm not good anyway.

114
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,443
Listen, maybe I can get
someone to cover my shift.

115
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,379
Don't worry about it.

116
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,548
No, I-I want you to be able
to look out into the audience

117
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,784
and see me, because that
way you'll know how much I...

118
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,620
Shh!
Mommy, I'm sleeping.

119
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:20,391
Good talk.

120
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,538
Hi.

121
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,877
You feeling better?

122
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:43,648
Oh, yeah.
My home is a real oasis.

123
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,420
- So, am I in trouble with Chef Rudy?
- He'll be fine.

124
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:52,090
He bought an eight ball and
took home the pastry chef.

125
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:56,027
Sleeping with your boss.
Who does that?

126
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,795
<i>Mom...?</i>

127
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,936
- Yeah, honey?
- I had a bad dream.

128
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,473
Oh, no, well, um...
why don't you go back to bed

129
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,808
and I'll come lay down
with you in a second?

130
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,883
I'm so sorry.
I owe you one.

131
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:26,024
Don't lay there too long.
The sprinklers come on in ten minutes.

132
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:45,276
- What the hell?
- Can I help you?

133
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,912
- What time is the talent show?
- What talent show?

134
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:51,115
- There's no talent show today?
- I don't think so.

135
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,418
Are you freaking kidding me?!

136
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:58,656
- I lost a day's pay for no reason?
- Maybe we were destined to meet.

137
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,362
It would definitely be
the high point of my day.

138
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,468
Psst! Roscoe!

139
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:12,904
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

140
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:13,972
What are you doing here?

141
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,607
- The talent show?
- That's not today.

142
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:20,445
- But you said it was!
- Guess I was wrong.

143
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,015
I guess you were.

144
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,933
Don't you kids tease him about this.

145
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,248
<i> Son of a bitch!</i>

146
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,227
Oh, God, I need a drink.

147
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:39,864
Hi, I'm Christy and I'm an alcoholic.

148
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,265
<i>Hi, Christy.</i>

149
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,335
I've been sober 118 days.

150
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,004
Oh, don't applaud for that.

151
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,673
They've been the worst
118 days of my life.

152
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,809
Um...

153
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:54,946
The only reason I'm here is because, uh,

154
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,848
I didn't want to turn into my mother.

155
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,183
And I did anyway.

156
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:03,821
Yeah, I drank like her.

157
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:06,758
I went through men like her.

158
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:11,789
Um, I was selfish to my kids
just like she was.

159
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,999
And I didn't know how
to live any other way

160
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,335
because she was my only role model.

161
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:22,807
I mean, some mothers teach
their daughters how to bake.

162
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:26,444
Mine taught me how to
beat a cavity search

163
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,047
and still feel like a lady.

164
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:33,584
Anyway, thanks for letting me share.

165
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:37,889
And I cannot tell you
how comforting it is

166
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:39,390
to be in a room with people

167
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:41,592
who are just as screwed
up as I am, so...

168
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,095
Oh, stop it.

169
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,001
<i>Hi, I'm Jim and I'm an alcoholic.</i>

170
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:51,202
<i>Hi, Jim.</i>

171
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:52,317
Aren't you a little old

172
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,173
to be blaming all your
problems on your mother?

173
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,678
Hi, Mom.

174
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,770
Hi, I'm Greg.
May I take your order?

175
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,906
Hi, Greg. I'm Bonnie and
this is my daughter, Christy.

176
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,795
- Hi.
- She and I haven't spoken

177
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,311
in a couple of years, so this
is kind of a big moment for us.

178
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,247
Oh, for God's sake.

179
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,215
What can you recommend
for a mother and daughter

180
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,553
who are reconnecting after
a long, angry silence?

181
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,456
Um... pie?

182
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,228
- Mom, please, just order.
- Um, is the mint tea decaffeinated?

183
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,997
- Yes.
- Do you promise?

184
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:38,065
If I have caffeine after
2:00, my sleep in ruined.

185
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,635
- I promise.
- Okay, Greg, but if I wake up

186
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,671
in the middle of the
night, I'm calling you.

187
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,710
Well, I'll-I'll give you my number.

188
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:51,946
Um, and for you?

189
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,148
We have a lovely
selection of local wines.

190
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:56,884
I'll have a bottle of each
and a funnel.

191
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,621
She's kidding. We're both
in Alcoholics Anonymous.

192
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,557
Mom, it's Alcoholics Anonymous,

193
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:04,792
not Alcoholics Tell Your Waiter.

194
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,164
Water is fine. Here, take
this knife away from me.

195
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:15,503
So, when were you going to
tell me you quit drinking?

196
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:17,071
Well, I was afraid if I called you,

197
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,839
I'd just start again.

198
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:20,808
Not that you care,

199
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,944
but I have two years
clean and sober myself.

200
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,579
You're right; I don't care.

201
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,982
Well, regardless,
it has really changed my life.

202
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,585
I have a steady job.
I exercise.

203
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,987
I'm in a book club!

204
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,257
I have become the kind of
woman I've always hated.

205
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,460
It is nice to see you
wearing underwear.

206
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,429
And not on your head.

207
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,566
<i>Here we go.</i>

208
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,768
Oh, Greg, honey,

209
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,870
can I trouble you for
some water without ice?

210
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,839
Ice isn't good for my digestive system.

211
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,809
- Yeah, of course.
- Really? Ice?

212
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,945
I think your digestive system
has seen worse than ice.

213
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,781
Excuse me?

214
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,917
Mom, I've watched you
lick cocaine crumbs

215
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,186
out of a shag carpet.

216
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,991
It's not a sin to be thrifty, dear.

217
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,693
Okay, here we go.

218
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,595
Now, I hope that you're
being nice to your mother.

219
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,960
- Go away, Greg!
- Right.

220
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,668
Whoa, whoa.
You know, just because you're sober

221
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,369
doesn't mean you can't take a Xanax.

222
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:25,473
Actually, Mom, it sort of does.

223
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:29,877
Really?
Maybe I don't have two years.

224
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,347
And I don't need a Xanax;
I'm doing great.

225
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,415
Well, that's funny, 'cause
your daughter says you're

226
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,451
hanging on by your fingernails
and sleeping with your boss.

227
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,920
Wait, when do you talk to Violet?

228
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,523
We talk all the time, and
we're Facebook friends.

229
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:44,091
I don't want her talking to you.

230
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,927
Well, she has to talk to somebody.
She's sexually active,

231
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:50,998
drinking, smoking grass.
Sound familiar?

232
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,700
You're making this about me?

233
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:55,002
No, it's okay.
I have come to understand

234
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:56,737
that you were the best
daughter you could be.

235
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:00,174
My job is to forgive you,
which I do.

236
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,809
Oh, my God!

237
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:06,614
- You forgive me?
- I've come a long way.

238
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,985
Excuse me, but if anybody
needs to be forgiven,

239
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,920
it's you, and I don't,
and I never will.

240
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,088
There's hardly a day I can remember

241
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,590
that I didn't come
home to an empty house.

242
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,992
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

243
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:21,929
While other mothers were cooking
dinner, you were cooking meth.

244
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:25,617
Otherwise known as "working."

245
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,503
I don't want you in my life.

246
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:32,139
And while you're at it,
stay away from my daughter!

247
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,308
She may need a better
role model than me,

248
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,621
but it's certainly not you.

249
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:43,984
- Is, uh, everything okay?
- My daughter doesn't get me.

250
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,387
Oh. I'm sorry.

251
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:50,198
What time do you get off work?
I could use a lap to cry on.

252
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:55,129
<i>Oh.</i>

253
00:14:57,098 --> 00:15:01,368
<i>Stop crying.
It wasn't an important finger.</i>

254
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,771
<i>This doesn't concern you.</i>

255
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,676
Oh, good, you're still here.

256
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,212
Hey, hi.
This is a surprise.

257
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,347
Yeah, I just really
needed to talk to you.

258
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,015
I am having the worst day.

259
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,885
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Yes, dear.

260
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,857
Um, Christy,
you know my, uh, wife.

261
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:26,026
Yeah, hi, Claudia.
Nice to see you again.

262
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,862
It's "Clowdia""

263
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,965
FYI, the ladies' room
needs some attention.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,367
I don't know if that's you, Christy.

265
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:36,537
It's not,
and it's "Christ-y."

266
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:39,073
Okay, dear, let's go.

267
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,308
- Bye.
- Yeah.

268
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,450
Don't serve the soup.

269
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,057
- Hey, Mom. Dad's here!
- Yo, yo, baby mama.

270
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,693
What do you want, Baxter?

271
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:02,029
A father can't visit his son?

272
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:05,099
Not when he's six months
behind on child support,

273
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:09,103
but you're welcome to wave
at him through the window.

274
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:11,305
Be right back, Roscoe.

275
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,141
Don't be afraid to hit
the hookers with a bat.

276
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:20,081
I think I may have found a way
to pay you your child support.

277
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:23,951
Trust me, Baxter,
you can't sell that much semen.

278
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,720
I know. I tried.

279
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,926
So, here's the deal:
I know a guy who can hook me up

280
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:34,795
with a couple of kilos
of premium Sonoma Kush.

281
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,865
All I need is $2,000...

282
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,769
...from you.

283
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:45,473
Just so I'm clear:
You want to pay child support

284
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:48,142
by borrowing money from
me so you can buy pot?

285
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,845
No. So I can sell pot.

286
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,217
There's no money in buying pot.
I know. I tried.

287
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,619
<i> Oh.</i>

288
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,921
Hey. Hello.

289
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:04,925
- What are you doing here?
- Um...

290
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,161
studying...?

291
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,464
You let Violet have boys
over while you're gone?

292
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:13,968
No, I do not, and don't worry
about her, she's not your kid.

293
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:17,204
I know, but this sets
a bad example for Roscoe.

294
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,741
Oh, you're worried
about setting a bad example?

295
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,827
You had Roscoe pee into a sippy cup

296
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:24,879
so you could pass a drug test.

297
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:27,148
And it worked.

298
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:33,754
I like bananas.
They have their own carrying case.

299
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,158
You know I can't divorce Claudia.

300
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:39,193
Her father owns the restaurant;

301
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:40,895
I'm pretty sure he'd
fire me, and then what?

302
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,797
I was an English major.

303
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,334
I can't believe you're
sleeping with that loser.

304
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,270
I can't believe you're
sleeping with this loser!

305
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,806
Hey, we were mostly studying.

306
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,608
Shut up, Luke.
I love him.

307
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:58,679
- Please, I used to love him!
- She did.

308
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,950
Mom, Luke and I have been
together for, like, a year.

309
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:06,020
You only started noticing
when you stopped drinking.

310
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:09,690
You're right.

311
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:11,392
I-I haven't been a very good mother,

312
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:14,261
- and I'm sorry, but...
- But what?

313
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,598
You want me to forgive you?

314
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,701
Oh, God, would you?
That'd be awesome!

315
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,970
Why should I forgive you

316
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,972
when you can't even
forgive your own mother?

317
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,941
- That's different.
- How?

318
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,815
Okay.

319
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,786
Okay...

320
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,861
Hello, Mom, it's Christy.

321
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,330
Yeah, yeah,
today was a blast.

322
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,334
Listen...

323
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,870
I just want you to know

324
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,874
that I forgive you
for everything you did

325
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,176
when I was growing up.

326
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:07,281
I get, now, that
you did the best you could...

327
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,252
...just like I'm doing.

328
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,356
And...

329
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,784
I hope that you and I can

330
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:21,061
wipe the slate clean
and start over.

331
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,901
No, I did not take
a Xanax from your purse!

332
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:31,105
Listen, I gotta go.
Yeah, talk soon.

333
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:35,209
There.
I've forgiven my mother.

334
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:39,613
- Are we good?
- It's not that easy.

335
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:42,750
Oh, come on!
Like me!

336
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:44,919
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

337
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:46,787
If you hit the hookers enough times,

338
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:49,457
they give you your money back!

339
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,696
Smart kid.
That's my semen at work.

340
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:03,170
- You still living in that red van?
- Yep.

341
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,606
Looks like your house is being towed.

342
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,310
Oh, no,
my cleaning lady's in there.

343
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,382
What a day, huh?

344
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,150
Hello...?

345
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,786
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hello, sweetie.

346
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,188
What are you doing here?

347
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,156
I just thought I'd help
out while you were at work.

348
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:36,091
You know, clean slate.

349
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,526
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yeah, she did.

350
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,761
Bonnie made Roscoe
and me hot dinner.

351
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:43,131
- Yeah, but I...
- It was hot, Mom!

352
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,134
Like on TV.

353
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,303
Night, Bonnie.

354
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:01,182
- She calls you Bonnie?
- We're like sisters.

355
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,418
You hungry?

356
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:05,820
No, thanks. I ate at the restaurant.

357
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,681
How about some tea?

358
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:09,624
Okay.

359
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:15,797
I'm so glad
you and I have a chance to

360
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,198
start over.

361
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,234
Forgive me,
but I'm not quite there yet.

362
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,038
Of course I forgive you.

363
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:26,770
You know...

364
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:30,219
I apologized for beeing
a crappy daughter.

365
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:35,765
- So, anything you wanna say to me...
- I love you with all my heart.

366
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,557
And?

367
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:39,997
And... from now on, I'm going

368
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,032
to be the kind of mother you deserve.

369
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,464
This is the start of a new chapter.

370
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,364
Oh, it's my date!

371
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,410
New chapter, same book.

372
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,689
- Ready to go?
- Let me just get my bag.

373
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,159
You remember our waiter Greg?

374
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,690
Hi, new dad!

375
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,800
Please stop.
He's way to young for me.

376
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:08,339
And he's... married.

377
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:11,862
Married?
What a whore.

378
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:15,831
Oh, I almost forgot.

379
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,592
Your daughter think
she might be pregnant.

380
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,077
Call me, if you need me.

381
