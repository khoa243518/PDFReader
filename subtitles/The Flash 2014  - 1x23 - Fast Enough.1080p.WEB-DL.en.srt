1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,838
To understand what I'm about to tell you,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,806
you need to do something first.

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,009
You need to believe in the impossible.

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,844
Can you do that? Good.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,178
You see that red blur?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,047
That's me.

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,049
That too.

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,986
There I am again.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,855
My name is Barry Allen.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,823
I am the fastest man alive.

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,796
My story is pretty simple.

12
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,831
My whole life, I have been running.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,199
Usually from bullies.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,769
Sometimes I escaped.

15
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,937
Sometimes I did not.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,606
Tell me what happened.

17
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,541
Those guys were picking on kids

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,010
just 'cause they thought they weren't cool.

19
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,312
- It wasn't right.
- I know.

20
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,481
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.
- No.

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,217
You have such a good heart, Barry.

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,320
And it's better to have
a good heart than fast legs.

23
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,623
Hello. I'm home.

24
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,025
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

25
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,093
And he won.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,263
Ah, way to go, slugger.

27
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,666
Oh, and uh, no more fighting.

28
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,700
Mm-mm.

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,785
But after that night,

30
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,054
I was running from something much scarier.

31
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,423
- Something I could never explain.
- Henry! Henry!

32
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,359
Something impossible.

33
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,361
Help!

34
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,764
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry, don't!

35
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,400
- Mom!
- Don't let him touch you!

36
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,769
Mom!

37
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,437
Mom!

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,673
- Nora!
- Stay back!

39
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,109
Nora, hold on!

40
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,113
Run, Barry, run!

41
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,014
Mom?

42
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,850
Dad?

43
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,898
Sorry.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,666
Second robbery this week.

45
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,835
The teller I.D.'d Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

46
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,270
What?

47
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,005
Oh, jeez, the Mardon Brothers are back?

48
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,673
What do we got?

49
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,475
Perps took the bank, shot out the cameras,

50
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,011
and as a chaser, killed
the security guard over there.

51
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,513
I've got unis kicking in doors

52
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,014
of known Mardon Brothers associates.

53
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,016
CSI been over it?

54
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,918
Uh, no.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,621
Where's Allen?

56
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,124
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,759
You can't keep covering for him.

58
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,628
- CSI, CSI coming through.
- If he's not here now,

59
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,996
I'm gonna have to carry on this
investigation without him.

60
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,330
Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

61
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,999
What was it this time, Mr. Allen?

62
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,467
Did you forget to set your alarm clock?

63
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,002
Before you answer, I should remind you

64
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,104
the excuse you gave last time
was car trouble.

65
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,672
Want to know why that one
was particularly memorable?

66
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,274
I do not own a car.

67
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,842
He was running an errand for me.

68
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:01,346
Barry, did you get me what I asked for?

69
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,148
Yeah, yeah. I did.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,885
I have it right...

71
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,521
Here.

72
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,657
I had a few bites of it.

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,044
Getaway car's a mustang shelby gt500.

74
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,479
Shelby's have a rear super-wide tire

75
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,981
specific to that model.

76
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,218
12 inches with an asymmetrical tread.

77
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,321
And there's something else.

78
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,989
Thanks.

79
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,995
Fecal excrement.

80
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,663
Animal, I'd guess.

81
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,166
My dad gave me that pen...

82
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,902
Before he died.

83
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,570
Sorry.

84
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,485
Okay, I am ready to see
this atom smasher smashing.

85
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,587
There was a shooting today.

86
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,756
Your dad needs me to process some evidence,

87
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,191
which means I don't know if we're going

88
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,892
to be able to make it to S.T.A.R. Labs.

89
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,262
But seeing this thing turn on
is like your dream.

90
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,197
Your sad, little nerdy dream.

91
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,565
Besides, I canceled a date for this.

92
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,201
Hands off my fries.

93
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,736
Unbelievable.

94
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,438
I'm stress eating over my dissertation.

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,107
We started selling cronuts at Jitters.

96
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,142
I ate two today. If I don't graduate soon,

97
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,578
I'm gonna be more muffin top than woman.

98
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,946
You look amazing.

99
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,817
What is so important

100
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,253
about this particle accelerator anyway?

101
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,722
Harrison Wells' work in quantum theory

102
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,724
is light-years ahead of anything
they're doing at Cern.

103
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,128
You're doing that thing where
you're not speaking English.

104
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,863
Okay.

105
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,599
Just imagine

106
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,469
that that dot is everything the human race

107
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,305
has ever learned until this moment.

108
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,639
Does that include "twerking"?

109
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,541
That is everything we could learn

110
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,143
from the particle accelerator.

111
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,944
It's a whole new way of looking at physics.

112
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,313
It will literally change the way

113
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,648
that we think about everything.

114
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,550
You got to get yourself a girlfriend.

115
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,385
Hey, leave him alone. He's working.

116
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,487
Hi, dad.

117
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,325
- Your test thingy is done.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,627
I think the Mardon Brothers
are hiding on a farm.

119
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,463
The fecal matter I found on
the street, it was cow manure,

120
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,099
which contained traces of oxytetracycline.

121
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,600
It's an antibiotic.

122
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,336
There are only four farms in the area

123
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,471
that still use it in their feed.

124
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,674
Bet you find a really sweet
shelby parked at one of them.

125
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,810
Dad, seeing as how Barry
solved your poop problem,

126
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,280
how about letting him go to S.T.A.R. Labs?

127
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,050
- Fine, go.
- Yes!

128
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,052
Thank you, Joe.

129
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,861
So, Barry, how was your trip?

130
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,831
Did you find proof of the
impossible in Starling City,

131
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,202
or did you just make my dad
mad for no reason?

132
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,204
Actually, while I was away,

133
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,073
I had a chance to think about...

134
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,842
You know, relationships.

135
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,578
And, well, I'm not in one.

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,948
And you're not in one, either.

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,117
And you're my best friend, Iris.

138
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,852
You're mine too.

139
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,320
Why else would I be here?

140
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,155
That's not what I meant. What I...

141
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,189
I know what you're gonna say, Barry.

142
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,557
I'm not sure you do.

143
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,092
Even though we pretty much grew up

144
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,694
in the same house together,

145
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,697
and we're kind of like brother and sister,

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,232
because we're not brother and sister,

147
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,768
it can get really weird and awkward

148
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,869
to talk to me about girls.

149
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,170
But I just want you to know

150
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,205
that it shouldn't be awkward.

151
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,673
There is nothing that I want more

152
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,041
than for you to meet the right person

153
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,344
that totally loves and adores you

154
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,847
for the amazing guy that you are.

155
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,451
Took the words right out of my mouth.

156
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,453
Aw, aren't you glad I know you so well?

157
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,497
Thank you.

158
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,933
My name is Harrison Wells.

159
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,236
Tonight, the future begins.

160
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,006
The work my team and I will do here

161
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,308
will change our understanding of physics.

162
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,944
We'll bring about advancements in power,

163
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,979
advancements in medicine,

164
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,514
and trust me, that future

165
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,616
will be here faster than you think.

166
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,788
Oh, hey, my laptop!
It's got my dissertation.

167
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,964
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,345
All right, kid, you don't have
to do this, all right?

169
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,746
Just give me back my friend's bag,

170
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,049
and we'll call it even.

171
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,684
Okay?

172
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,121
Barry!

173
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,025
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,393
Freeze! Police!

175
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,828
Or do you want to find out the hard way

176
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,398
you're not faster than a bullet?

177
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,837
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

178
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,172
So he caught a mugger?

179
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,040
He's a transfer from keystone.

180
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,376
Started a few weeks ago. Eddie Thawne.

181
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,514
Oh, that's Detective Pretty Boy.

182
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,849
That's what my dad calls him.

183
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,520
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

184
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,388
He is pretty though.

185
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,563
This is the last farm on Barry's list.

186
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,864
Look, I know the kid's smart,

187
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,299
but you said it yourself.

188
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,202
Sometimes he's chasing flying pigs.

189
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,371
Well, let's check it out anyway.

190
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,284
I'm Linda park, and we're live
outside S.T.A.R. Labs

191
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,618
despite the inclement weather,

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,086
which is only going to get worse.

193
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,055
The torrential downpour
has in no way affected

194
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,356
the particle accelerator,

195
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,058
which is up and running smoothly

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,561
according to S.T.A.R.
Labs CEO Harrison Wells.

197
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:26,398
The weather has also...

198
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,795
- Whoa.
- Mardon.

199
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,297
Ah!

200
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,872
I've got a plane to catch!

201
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,280
What the hell?

202
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,648
Ah!

203
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,189
Chyre, hang in there.

204
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,066
Wait, we're now being told
to evacuate the facility.

205
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,735
The storm may have caused a malfunction

206
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,536
to the primary cooling system.

207
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,071
Officials are now trying to shut down

208
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,873
the particle accelerator, but so far,

209
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,643
have been unable to regain
control of the system...

210
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,028
What the hell happened to him?

211
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,030
He was hit by lightning.

212
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,265
How is he still alive?

213
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,866
Go.

214
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,768
No heartbeat. CBC, chem 24,
type and cross four.

215
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,203
- Bag him.
- He's coding.

216
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,205
- You can't be in here.
- I'm family.

217
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,773
- Charge the paddles to 200.
- Barry!

218
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,975
Clear.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,293
What are you doing?

220
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,494
He likes this song.

221
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,229
How could you possibly know that?

222
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,931
I checked his Facebook page.

223
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,433
I mean, he can hear everything, right?

224
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,634
Auditory functions are the last

225
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,837
sensory faculties to degenerate.

226
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,973
♪ Can't read my no
he can't read my poker... ♪

227
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,975
Oh, my God!

228
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,844
- Where am I?
- He's up.

229
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,413
Dr. Wells, get down
to the cortex, like, right now.

230
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,616
Pulse 120, pupils equally
reactive to light.

231
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,819
Look at me, look at me.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, relax.

232
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,121
Everything's okay, man.

233
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,722
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

234
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,491
S.T.A.R. Labs? Who are you?

235
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm cisco Ramon. She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

236
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,162
I need you to urinate in this.

237
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,764
Not this second.

238
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,732
What is... what is happening?
What is going on?

239
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,602
You were struck by lightning, dude.

240
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,772
What?

241
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,840
Lightning gave me abs?

242
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,242
Your muscles should be atrophied,

243
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,810
but instead they're in a chronic

244
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,845
and unexplained state
of cellular regeneration.

245
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,548
Come here. Have a seat.

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,916
You were in a coma.

247
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,718
For how long?

248
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,020
Nine months.

249
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,323
Welcome back, Mr. Allen.

250
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,860
We have a lot to discuss.

251
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,662
It's hard to believe I'm here.

252
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,031
I have always wanted
to meet you face to face.

253
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,633
Yeah?

254
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,201
Well, you certainly went to
great lengths to do it.

255
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,804
S.T.A.R. Labs has not been operational

256
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,372
since FEMA categorized us

257
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:31,009
as a class four hazardous location.

258
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,811
17 people died that night.

259
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,345
Many more were injured.

260
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,915
Myself amongst them.

261
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,050
Jeez.

262
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,820
What happened?

263
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,455
Nine months ago, the particle accelerator

264
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,491
went online exactly as planned.

265
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,727
For 45 minutes, I had
achieved my life's dream.

266
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,298
And then... Then there was an anomaly.

267
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,733
The electron volts became unmeasurable,

268
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,335
the ring under us popped.

269
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,571
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky

270
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,973
and that, in turn, seeded a storm cloud...

271
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,209
That created a lightning bolt

272
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,277
that struck me.

273
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,380
That's right.

274
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:13,518
I was recovering myself...

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,688
When I heard about you.

276
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,757
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages

277
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,026
every time you were going
into cardiac arrest,

278
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,229
which was actually a misdiagnosis

279
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,565
because you see,
you weren't flatlining, Barry.

280
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,901
Your heartbeat was moving too fast

281
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,270
for the EKG to register it.

282
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,874
Now, I'm not the most popular
person in town these days,

283
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,443
but Detective West and his daughter

284
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,811
gave me permission to bring you here,

285
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,146
where we were able to stabilize you.

286
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,481
- Iris?
- Iris, yes.

287
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,450
She came to see you quite often.

288
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,784
She talks a lot.

289
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,253
Also, she's hot.

290
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,054
- I need to go.
- No, you can't.

291
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,856
No, no. No, Caitlin's right.

292
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,291
No, now that you're awake,
we need to do more tests.

293
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,293
You're still going through changes.

294
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,694
There's so much that we don't know.

295
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,030
I'm fine. Really, I feel normal.

296
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,965
Thank you for saving my life.

297
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,167
Really?

298
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,936
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

299
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,205
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Okay.

300
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,115
Sure.

301
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:22,020
- Fill 'er up?
- Thanks.

302
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,796
Oh, my God.

303
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,335
You're awake.

304
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,836
Why didn't S.T.A.R. Labs call us?

305
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,305
I just woke up.

306
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,973
Should you even be on your feet?

307
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,509
Iris, I... I'm okay.

308
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,613
I watched you die, Barry.

309
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,949
You kept dying. Your heart kept stopping.

310
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,120
It's still beating.

311
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,457
- Feels really fast.
- Oops.

312
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,731
Are you okay, Tracy?

313
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,535
Yeah, I got it.

314
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,838
My dad is gonna be so happy to see you.

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,274
Let me get my stuff, okay? Be right back.

316
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,651
Thank you. Thank you so much.

317
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,521
How can I help you today?

318
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,890
"This is a robbery."

319
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,992
Is this supposed to be a joke?

320
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,494
You tell me.

321
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,542
Oh, you scared the hell out of us, kid.

322
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,945
Yeah, that was quite the nap
you took there, baby face,

323
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,347
and you still look 12.

324
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,016
You look okay.

325
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,584
Are you really?

326
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,486
- Yeah.
- Detective West,

327
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,789
we've got a 5.15 in progress
at gold city bank, two dead.

328
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,457
Storm's really picking up
on the South side.

329
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,825
I'd grab your rain gear.

330
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,460
I'm sorry, Barry. I got to run.

331
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,429
- Do you need my help?
- No, you take it easy.

332
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,431
There'll be plenty for you to do
once you settle in.

333
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,300
Let's go, partner.

334
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,504
Hey, Allen. Glad to see you.

335
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,839
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

336
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,341
Detective, you should go.

337
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,277
My dad doesn't like to be kept waiting.

338
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,513
Glad you're back.

339
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,987
The night of the explosion,

340
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,889
Clyde Mardon shot and killed Chyre.

341
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,624
Mardon and his brother
died trying to escape.

342
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,958
Their plane crashed.

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Iris, got a minute?

344
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,495
Hey, Barry. Good to see you.

345
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,770
Screw you!

346
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,472
You okay?

347
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,274
I... I'm fine.

348
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,675
I... I just need some air.

349
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,744
But I'll call you tonight, all right?

350
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,488
What's happening to me?

351
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,131
Oh, oh!

352
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,192
Awesome.

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,767
You don't really believe he
can run that fast, do you?

354
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,069
Well, I believe anything is possible,

355
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,237
and in a few minutes,

356
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,306
maybe you will too.

357
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,575
How does it fit?

358
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,815
It's a little snug.

359
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,250
At least you will be moving so fast

360
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,319
no one will see you.

361
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,788
See, you thought the
world was slowing down.

362
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,056
It wasn't.

363
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,625
You were moving so fast

364
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,427
it only looked like everyone
else was standing still.

365
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,463
Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output,

366
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,765
and Caitlin, your vitals.

367
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,100
What do you do?

368
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,403
I make the toys, my man. Check it.

369
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,106
This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified.

370
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,175
Typically designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise,

371
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,977
or in your case, potential sonic booms,

372
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,114
which would be awesome.

373
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,256
- What?
- Nothing.

374
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,660
I just noticed you don't smile too much.

375
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,163
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over,

376
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,598
my boss is in a wheelchair for life,

377
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,333
the explosion that put you in a coma

378
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,169
also killed my fiance.

379
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:09,840
So this blank expression kind of
feels like the way to go.

380
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,276
Mr. Allen, while I am extremely eager

381
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,246
to determine your full range of abilities,

382
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,282
I do caution restraint.

383
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,117
Yeah.

384
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,783
Woo-hoo!

385
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,485
He just passed 200 Miles per hour.

386
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,423
It's not possible.

387
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,899
Mom!

388
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,302
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

389
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,738
No! Don't let him touch you!

390
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
Aah!

391
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,323
What is all this?

392
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,625
Witnesses from the robbery
at Gold City Bank.

393
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,527
Perp made off with 200 grand, more or less.

394
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,163
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

395
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,632
It was like a hurricane.

396
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,367
Everyone ran for cover.

397
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,036
We're going to have
a sketch artist work with you,

398
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,073
if you feel up to it.

399
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,574
Third robbery in a month

400
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,243
where a freak storm precedes it.

401
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,178
Sounds like one of those
"wide world of weird" cases

402
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,813
- Barry's obsessed with.
- He's not obsessed.

403
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,081
Guess you haven't read his blog.

404
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,949
The security cameras at the bank.

405
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,718
Apparently it all shorted out.

406
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,087
We got a bunch of witnesses here.

407
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,955
They all have cell phones.

408
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,391
The sky went black and then, boom.

409
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,460
Outside was inside.

410
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,095
Man, it was like there was a thunderstorm

411
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,563
in the bank.

412
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,299
Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black Mustang.

413
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:18,369
Partial plate six-kilo-Charlie-three.

414
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,937
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

415
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,943
It looks like you had
a distal radius fracture.

416
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,379
Had?

417
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,414
It's healed... In three hours.

418
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,084
How is that even possible?

419
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,920
We don't know... yet.

420
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,356
You really need to learn how to stop.

421
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,757
What happened out there today?

422
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,258
You were moving pretty well,

423
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,363
and then something
caused you to lose focus.

424
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,598
I started remembering something.

425
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,606
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

426
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,613
It was late.

427
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,148
A sound woke me up.

428
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,986
I came downstairs and...

429
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,523
I saw what looked like a ball of lightning.

430
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,259
Inside the lightning,

431
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,629
there was a man.

432
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,199
He killed my mom.

433
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,368
They arrested my dad.

434
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,105
He's still sitting
in Iron Heights for her murder.

435
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,541
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,

436
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,210
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

437
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,682
But what if the man who killed my mom

438
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,418
was like me?

439
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,287
Well, I think I can say unequivocally

440
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,923
you are one of a kind.

441
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,330
Can I help you, detective?

442
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,199
You can stop acting like you can't stand me

443
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,667
when your dad's around.

444
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,436
Aww.

445
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:02,273
And I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

446
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,557
You can't tell my dad.

447
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,492
He doesn't know about me and Eddie.

448
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,561
Doesn't seem like anyone's
in on the secret.

449
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,729
I was gonna tell you.

450
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,064
When you were in the hospital,

451
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,499
Eddie covered my father's shifts

452
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,534
so that we could both be with you.

453
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,102
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,

454
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:36,173
and things just kind of happened.

455
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,376
And it's good.

456
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,845
Dating your partner's daughter...

457
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,247
Isn't that against department regulations?

458
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,082
Why are you so upset?

459
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,251
I just don't like having
to lie to your dad, you know?

460
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,931
Barry?

461
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,458
Hey! Mardon!

462
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,440
That poor man.

463
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,775
The way that fog came in,

464
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,543
I have never seen anything like it.

465
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,645
Barry! Iris.

466
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,881
I'm all right, dad.

467
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,149
What the hell were you thinking

468
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,517
- having her out here?
- No, no, no...

469
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,152
And I told you, when you see danger,

470
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,987
you run the other way. You're not a cop.

471
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,522
- Because you wouldn't let me.
- You're damn right.

472
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,623
Joe, I need to talk to you.

473
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:37,595
- It can wait.
- No, now.

474
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,597
I know who did this.

475
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,799
It's Clyde Mardon.

476
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,834
I know everybody thinks
he died in a plane crash

477
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,035
after the S.T.A.R. Labs explosion,

478
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,671
but he is alive.

479
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,106
All right, something
happened to him that night.

480
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:54,545
I... I think he can control the weather.

481
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,614
The recent robberies,
they all happened during

482
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,315
freak meteorological events.

483
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,517
And when I just confronted Mardon,

484
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,155
the street was instantly enveloped in fog.

485
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,058
Of course you don't believe me.

486
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,561
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

487
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,829
You want to do this now?

488
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,430
Out here? Fine.

489
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,733
Mardon is dead.

490
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,901
There is no controlling the weather, Barry.

491
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,503
Just like there was no lightning storm

492
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,038
in your house that night.

493
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,073
It was your brain
helping a scared little boy

494
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,274
accept what he saw.

495
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,909
My dad did not murder my mother.

496
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,678
Yes, he did! Your dad killed
your mother, Barry!

497
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,513
I am sorry, son!

498
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,048
But I knew it, the jury knew it,

499
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,249
and now he's paying for what he did.

500
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,018
- Dad, enough!
- Unh-uh, Iris.

501
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,419
I have done my best to take care of you

502
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,887
since that night, and I have never asked

503
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,589
for anything in return,
not even a thank you,

504
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,191
but what I do ask now is that you

505
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,595
for once in your life
see things as they are.

506
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,073
You're not going to believe this.

507
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,341
We got the eyewitness sketch

508
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,743
of the robber from the bank job.

509
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,747
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

510
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,549
But that's impossible.

511
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,385
He's dead, right?

512
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,920
I wasn't the only one affected

513
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:14,958
by the particle accelerator
explosion, was I?

514
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
We don't know for sure.

515
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,461
You said the city was safe,

516
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,730
that there was no residual danger.

517
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:24,301
But that's not true, so what
really happened that night?

518
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,936
Well...

519
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,805
The accelerator went active.

520
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:31,608
We all felt like heroes, and then...

521
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,843
It all went wrong.

522
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,745
The dimensional barrier ruptured,

523
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,181
unleashing unknown energies into our world.

524
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,749
Antimatter, dark energy, x-elements...

525
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,117
Those are all theoretical.

526
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,119
And how theoretical are you?

527
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,622
We mapped the dispersion

528
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,924
throughout and around Central City.

529
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,125
Though we have no way of knowing

530
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,728
exactly what or... Who was exposed,

531
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,763
we've been searching for other

532
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,766
- meta-humans like yourself.
- "Meta-humans"?

533
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,735
That's what we're calling them.

534
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,403
I saw one today.

535
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,672
He's a bank robber, and he
can control the weather.

536
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,640
This just keeps getting cooler.

537
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,476
This is not cool.

538
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,745
All right? A man died.

539
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,814
Mardon must have gotten his
powers the same way I did.

540
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,216
From the storm cloud.

541
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,284
He's still out there.

542
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,487
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

543
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,322
Barry!

544
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,556
That's a job for the police.

545
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,858
I work for the police.

546
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,193
As a forensic assistant.

547
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,695
You're responsible for this.

548
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:25,796
For him.

549
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,732
What's important is you!

550
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,401
Not me. I lost everything.

551
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,003
I lost my company.

552
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,538
I lost my reputation.

553
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
I lost my freedom.

554
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,575
And then you broke your arm,

555
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,744
and it healed in three hours.

556
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,347
Inside your body could be a map

557
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,216
to a whole new world... Genetic therapies,

558
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,353
vaccines, medicines, treasures buried deep

559
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,689
within your cells and we cannot
risk losing everything

560
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,560
because you want to go out and play hero!

561
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:59,663
You're not a hero.

562
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,032
You are just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

563
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,353
I didn't do this.

564
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,055
I swear to God, I didn't do this.

565
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,690
Dad, why are they taking you?

566
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,559
- Barry, don't go in the house.
- Where's mom?

567
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,560
What's gonna happen to my son?

568
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,994
- Dad!
- Barry!

569
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,864
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house!

570
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:38,235
Barry!

571
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,170
Joe, you know these people?

572
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,639
My daughter's best friends with their kid.

573
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,342
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

574
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,220
- Mom.
- Barry.

575
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,721
Mom!

576
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,936
So that's my story.

577
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,973
I've spent my whole life
searching for the impossible,

578
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,910
never imagining that I would

579
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,646
become the impossible.

580
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,053
So why come to me?

581
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,289
Something tells me you
didn't just run 600 Miles

582
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,224
to say "hi" to a friend.

583
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:39,229
All my life, I've wanted to just do more...

584
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,031
Be more.

585
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,466
And now I am.

586
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,135
And the first chance I get to help someone,

587
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,871
I screw up.

588
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,706
What if Wells is right?

589
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,475
What if I'm not a hero?

590
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,810
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

591
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,445
I don't think that bolt of lightning

592
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,048
struck you, Barry.

593
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,319
I think it chose you.

594
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,489
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

595
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,625
I don't know if I can be some... vigilante.

596
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,663
You can be better.

597
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:16,633
Because you can inspire people

598
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,770
in a way that I never could...

599
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,172
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel...

600
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,943
Making a difference...

601
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,946
Saving people...

602
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,882
In a flash.

603
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,854
Take your own advice.

604
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,856
Wear a mask.

605
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,965
Cool.

606
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,670
Cool.

607
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,211
I've been going over unsolved cases

608
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,512
from the past nine months,

609
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,981
and there's been a sharp increase

610
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,383
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

611
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,851
Your meta-humans have been busy.

612
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,519
Now, I'm not blaming you.

613
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,822
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

614
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,091
I know you all lost something.

615
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,559
But I need your help to catch Mardon

616
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,561
and anyone else out there like him.

617
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,996
But I can't do it without you.

618
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,436
If we're gonna do this,

619
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,672
I have something that might help.

620
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,508
Something I've been playing with.

621
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,876
Designed to replace the turnouts

622
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,012
firefighters traditionally wear.

623
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,780
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
could do something nice

624
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,215
for the community, maybe people wouldn't

625
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,183
be so angry at Dr. Wells anymore.

626
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,185
How is it going to help me?

627
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,754
It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

628
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,589
It's heat and abrasive resistant,

629
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,057
so it should withstand your moving

630
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,392
at high-velocity speeds.

631
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:49,726
And the aerodynamic design

632
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,094
should help you maintain control.

633
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,562
Plus, it has built-in sensors

634
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,031
so we can track your vitals

635
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,499
and stay in contact with you from here.

636
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,867
Thanks.

637
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,502
Now how do we find Mardon?

638
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,437
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

639
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,139
to track meteorological abnormalities

640
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,273
over Central City.

641
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,674
We just got a ping.

642
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,610
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20 millibars

643
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,645
in a matter of seconds.

644
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,581
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

645
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,752
I'm not saying Mardon is alive.

646
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,254
But if he was, this is the last place

647
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,588
him and his brother hid out.

648
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,090
Let's go.

649
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,103
Mardon?

650
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,738
On your feet.

651
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,239
Hands on your head.

652
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,075
You got me.

653
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,448
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew,

654
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,249
after our plane went down,

655
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,085
and I woke up on the ground alive,

656
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:53,290
when I saw what I can do, I understood.

657
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,458
I am God.

658
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,594
Shut the hell up.

659
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,496
Turn around.

660
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,373
Do you think that your guns can stop God?

661
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,977
Why in the hell would God
need to rob banks?

662
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,979
You're right.

663
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,849
I've been thinking too small.

664
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,653
Barry! Barry!

665
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,288
This thing's getting closer.

666
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,690
Wind speeds are 200
Miles-per-hour and increasing.

667
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,758
Barry, can you hear me?

668
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,627
Yeah. Loud and clear.

669
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:08,031
If it keeps up, this could
become an F-5 tornado.

670
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,199
But it's headed towards the city.

671
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,968
How do I stop it? Guys?

672
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,740
What if I unravel it?

673
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,375
How the hell are you going to do that?

674
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,277
I'll run around it
in the opposite direction,

675
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,045
cut off its legs.

676
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,780
He'd have to clock
700 Miles-per-hour to do that.

677
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,849
Your body may not
be able to handle those speeds.

678
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,384
You'll die.

679
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,220
I have to try.

680
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,066
The suit's holding up.

681
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,868
- But he's not.
- He can do it.

682
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,870
I know he can do it.

683
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,088
It's too strong!

684
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,958
It's time to think big.

685
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,865
You can do this, Barry.

686
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,000
You were right.

687
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,369
I am responsible for all of this.

688
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,338
So many people have been hurt

689
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,939
because of me, and when I looked at you,

690
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,976
all I saw was another potential
victim of my hubris.

691
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,544
And yes, I created this madness,

692
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,814
but you, Barry, you can stop it.

693
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,183
You can do this.

694
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,319
Now run, Barry, run!

695
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,034
Barry?

696
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,339
Hey.

697
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,246
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

698
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,348
I'm not like you.

699
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,685
You're a murderer.

700
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,890
- Barry?
- It's over.

701
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,392
I'm okay.

702
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,261
What you can do...

703
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,465
It was the lightning bolt?

704
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,735
More or less.

705
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,804
I'm sorry, Barry.

706
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:38,041
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

707
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:42,612
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

708
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,913
But you really did see something

709
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,081
that night your mom died.

710
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,719
And your dad is innocent.

711
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,091
I need you to promise me something.

712
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,093
I don't want you telling Iris

713
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:00,296
about anything you can do, any of it.

714
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,132
I want her safe.

715
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,201
Promise me.

716
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,604
Yeah.

717
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,758
Hey, slugger.

718
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
You've been calling me that since I was 11.

719
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:34,364
Funny thing is, I finally got

720
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:35,765
into a fight today.

721
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,367
You just got out of a coma.

722
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,871
I'm not sure you should be picking fights.

723
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,140
Hey...

724
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,976
Did you win?

725
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,212
Yeah, I did.

726
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,789
You didn't kill mom.

727
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,626
You know I know that, right?

728
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,530
You believing me is all I need.

729
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,337
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

730
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,506
Whoever killed mom...

731
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:20,176
Whatever killed her...

732
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,445
I think I finally have a way to find them.

733
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:23,780
To stop them.

734
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:27,450
Barry, we've talked about this.

735
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,985
It's time to let it go.

736
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:33,523
You have got to stop worrying about me,

737
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,991
and live your life.

738
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,998
For the first time,
I feel like I finally can.

739
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,336
The truth is,
ever since the night mom died,

740
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,805
I've been stuck in one place,

741
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:52,308
missed out on a lot of things.

742
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,010
But I'm different now.

743
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,312
I've made some new friends.

744
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,014
They're helping me find my way...

745
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,283
Why is it shaped like a lightning bolt?

746
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,352
So it's not boring.

747
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,087
To finally move forward.

748
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,023
You remember when you
wanted me to change my name

749
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:11,761
so I wouldn't have to deal with
people knowing you're my dad?

750
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:15,098
I'm glad they know.

751
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:22,438
I'm so proud to be your son.

752
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,481
I love you, son.

753
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:35,518
I love you too, dad.

754
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,734
My name is Barry Allen,

755
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,771
and I am the fastest man alive.

756
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,276
A friend recently gave me

757
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,978
the idea for a new name.

758
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,752
And something tells me,
it's gonna catch on.

759
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,463
Greg, move your head!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,302
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:06,171
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,840
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,642
- by something impossible.
- Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,045
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,949
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,283
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,752
I'm an ordinary
forensics scientist,

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,688
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,356
and find others like me.

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,657
And one day, I'll find

12
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,426
who killed my mother...
Mom!

13
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,194
And get justice for my father.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,163
I am... The Flash.

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,500
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

16
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,201
Cisco, if you don't
seal off the blast,

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,937
everyone in this building
will die, including Caitlin.

18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,205
Don't look for me again.

19
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,673
Ronnie's alive,

20
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,009
and he's out there,
alone and scared.

21
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,045
Hartley Rathaway
Possesses one of the finest

22
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,880
scientific minds
I've ever encountered.

23
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,481
I can't imagine
how you're gonna feel

24
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,383
when you open up these doors
and let me out of here.

25
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,751
Why would I ever do that?

26
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,154
Because I know
where Ronnie Raymond is.

27
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,998
Honey... honey...

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,933
Dana.
Oh, God.

29
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,234
Someone!

30
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,336
- Help!
- Somebody help us.

31
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,080
See if you can get the power
of that line shut down.

32
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,881
You guys lay down the hose line.

33
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,284
- Please help!
- Help us!

34
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,752
- Help us!

35
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,153
- Hold on!

36
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,694
Stay here, all right?

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,162
I gotcha.

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,844
Dana!

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,989
How did...

40
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,559
I love you.

41
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,963
Thank you,

42
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,965
Flash.

43
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,573
Dude.

44
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,175
That was insane.

45
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,477
I mean,
even I'm having a hard time

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,646
getting mad at you
for dirtying up my suit.

47
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,748
Okay, when are we going to
start considering it my suit?

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,284
I'd be comfortable calling it
our suit.

49
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,585
"Our suit."

50
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,921
Tonight was the fastest
you've ever run.

51
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,756
Yes, your training is
paying off.

52
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,259
That couple is alive tonight
because of you.

53
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,494
I can still get faster.
I know I can.

54
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,163
And you will one day, I'm sure.

55
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,098
But for today,

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,000
I'd say you've fulfilled
your save quota.

57
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,503
Proper rest is what you need,
as do we all.

58
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,473
Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink.

59
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,008
Who's up for a round?

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,743
Oh, dude, it's...
it's movie night with Joe.

61
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,178
I can't.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,346
But I'll see you guys tomorrow,
all right?

63
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,915
- Bye.
- Night.

64
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:03,917
What about you?

65
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,350
Drinks on me?

66
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,453
I think I'll pass.

67
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,657
You okay?

68
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,493
I was looking for my tablet
at your work station,

69
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,295
and I found this.

70
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,829
I can explain.

71
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,965
I know you said we should
stop looking for Ronnie,

72
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,466
so I...

73
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,168
didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

74
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,469
Why?

75
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,871
Hartley.
He said he knew

76
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,306
what happened to Ronnie.

77
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,041
Oh, Hartley Rathaway,

78
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,343
who is currently locked up in
our super-villain basement jail

79
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,711
for going psycho
with sound waves?

80
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,213
Yeah.
He's made some poor choices.

81
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,581
There's no argument there.

82
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,049
But I looked into
what he was saying and...

83
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,650
Cisco.
Ronnie's gone,

84
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,253
and it's time for me to
move on with my life.

85
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,291
Doesn't seem like it.

86
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,460
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,697
Look, I'm not an expert
on love,

88
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,867
but I think in order to
move on from Ronnie,

89
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,870
you actually have to move on.

The security cameras in
half the prison are shut down.

120
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,348
Then Clay Parker,
according to this data log,

121
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,782
who was still
locked in his cell,

122
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,651
somehow vanishes.

123
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,654
Not completely.

124
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,322
What's that?

125
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,858
It's some kind of
organic particulate residual.

126
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,593
I found it on the floor
in here,

127
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,828
just outside the cell,

128
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,563
out in the hallway.

129
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,898
Trail led me
all the way outside.

130
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,703
Dad.

131
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,450
So...

132
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,818
Word around here is,

133
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,653
Parker pulled a Shawshank?

134
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,522
Yep, and none of
the other prisoners

135
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,924
heard or saw anything.

136
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, they wouldn't talk to you
about it.

137
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,997
Leaves us with
not a lot to go on.

138
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,599
Well, if there's anyone
who can figure out

139
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,667
how Parker got out of here,

140
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,536
it's you, Son.

141
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,371
Come on, Allen, let's go.

142
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,373
Duty calls.

143
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,819
So, my dad just happened
to come by?

144
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,222
The guard owed me a favor.

145
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,224
Thank you.

146
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,000
Thanks for...

147
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,335
getting me
out of that hellhole.

148
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,304
You'd have done the same
for me, right?

149
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,674
So...

150
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,476
How the hell did this
happen to you?

151
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,344
Don't know.

152
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,981
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

153
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,516
I was passing out for
no reason,

154
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,618
waking up in odd places.

155
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,389
It took me a while before
I could control it.

156
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,291
Soon as I could...

157
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,728
I came for you.

158
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,131
What, so you can just

159
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,599
jump wherever you want?

160
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,267
If I can see where
I'm going.

161
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,603
We got a second chance, Clay.

162
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,904
We can leave Central City.

163
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,909
Do... do all the things
we talked about.

164
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,346
I can't leave yet, baby.

165
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,249
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

166
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,218
I skipped town
before paying him back.

167
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
He'll find us.

168
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,323
Hey, but with what you can do,

169
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,726
we can pay off that debt.

170
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,797
Then we'll be free, and
we can go anywhere in the world.

171
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,366
Together.

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,875
Not even Barry's cells
move this fast.

173
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,743
I've never seen
anything like it.

174
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,712
So Clay Parker is a meta-human?

175
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,080
Not so fast.

176
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,816
The particulate residue
Barry gathered

177
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,185
at Iron Heights does contain
Clay Parker's DNA,

178
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,854
but also DNA of a woman.

179
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,056
Run her DNA against
the CCPD criminal database.

180
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,059
See if you get a match.

181
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,464
Yahtzee.

182
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,999
Her name's Shawna Baez.

183
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,467
Mostly petty crimes,

184
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,869
and this girl likes to party,
apparently.

185
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,405
Long list of disorderly conducts
at local bars.

186
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,541
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

187
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,209
- Barry?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,644
In the meantime,
let's track these particulates

189
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,813
and see how they work.

190
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,815
I'll be right with you guys.

191
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:20,125
I've had the biggest craving
for Thai food.

192
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,627
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie

193
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,629
and how he was still alive.

194
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,599
And you said Professor Stein
was at S.T.A.R. Labs

195
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,100
the night of the explosion.

196
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,404
Yes.
He was.

197
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,239
Why?

198
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:43,048
The mystery isn't why Stein went
to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

199
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,351
It's why he didn't leave.

200
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,919
Tell me.

201
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,754
Can't.
I have to show you.

202
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,559
You are not getting out
of this cell.

203
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,031
Fair enough,
but I know you, Cisco.

204
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,633
I know how much
you looked up to Ronnie.

205
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,468
He was like family.

206
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,372
A family
you built for yourself here.

207
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,041
I know how much you want
to see that family healed.

208
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,643
Let me help you.

209
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:15,146
I don't believe you.

210
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,049
Well, I'm telling you
the truth, Cisco.

211
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,953
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

212
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,572
What's that smile about?

213
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,807
I saw my dad today.

214
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,109
No glass, no phones.

215
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,710
Just me and him, face-to-face.

216
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,811
Joe arranged it.

217
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,713
That must have been amazing,
Barry.

218
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,915
Yeah.
I really needed it.

219
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,518
I'm sure he needed it, too.

220
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,521
Were you there
investigating the breakout?

221
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,024
- Mm-hmm.
- That is a big story.

222
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,192
Which I am not a part of.

223
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,362
My editor wants me writing about
The Flash, and only The Flash.

224
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,764
Is that a bad thing?

225
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,165
I don't know.
I would just like

226
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,434
to be thought of
as more than The Flash PR flack.

227
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,936
I mean,
if I don't write something soon,

228
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,338
I think I might lose my job.

229
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,806
Hey, no.

230
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,042
We will find you
a great story to write about.

231
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,176
Together.

232
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,678
Okay?

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,314
You know
I'm always here for you.

234
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,316
I know.

235
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,125
Didn't know you enjoyed yourself
a little rough trade.

236
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,261
If I'm gonna let you out,

237
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:40,765
I'm not taking any chances.

238
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,768
Curiosity's a maddening thing,
is it not?

239
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,341
What do you mean
you've been asking around?

240
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,144
Do you know
a Marcus Stockheimer?

241
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,981
Sure,
he's some mid-level gangster.

242
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,650
He works mainly on
the south side.

243
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,352
Word is, Clay Parker was
a runner for Marcus.

244
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,222
When Clay got pinched,
Marcus lost a lot of money.

245
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,658
Apparently Marcus doesn't like
losing money.

246
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,426
So, what?
So Parker can't leave

247
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,395
Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

248
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,996
From what I'm told,

249
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,531
if you're a member of
the Stockheimer crew,

250
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,833
you get out,

251
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,501
first thing you do is
pay him a visit

252
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,704
or suffer the consequences.

253
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,239
All right.

254
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,908
No more playing cop.

255
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,443
Promise me.

256
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,413
I hear you.

257
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,681
All right.

258
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,056
You said you were gonna show me
what happened to Ronnie.

259
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,058
Ronnie died inside the building.

260
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,993
What are we doing out here?

261
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,829
What do you see?

262
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,498
I don't know.

263
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,702
Buildings, walls, dirt.

264
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,538
Wells would be so disappointed
in your observational skills.

265
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,541
Look again.

266
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,949
It's Japanese.

267
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,484
How can you speak six languages

268
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,887
and sound like a dick
in every one of them?

269
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,989
It means "bomb shadow."

270
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,824
They found these
all over Hiroshima

271
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,560
after the first atomic bomb
was dropped.

272
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:20,598
This shadow belonged to
Martin Stein.

273
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,135
The accelerator explosion
did this to him?

274
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,837
You really don't see it,
do you?

275
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,306
You're gonna kick yourself
when you figure it out.

276
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,276
Oh, man.

277
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,945
You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

278
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,814
This is just another one of
your lame-ass tricks.

279
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,081
Come on.

280
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,918
We're going back
into the Pipeline.

281
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,219
Oh!

282
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,656
Aah!

283
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,369
Aah!

284
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,172
You're not the only one who
understands vibrations, Hartley.

285
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,074
Those cochlear devises
you're wearing?

286
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,576
I made a few adjustments.

287
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,744
No, please don't!

288
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,046
Aah.

289
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,814
If you know how to find Ronnie,

290
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,516
then you better tell me.

291
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,550
Right now.

292
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,685
Please, make it stop.

293
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,687
Please.
I'll show you.

294
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,487
I'll show...
ah... aah!

295
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,157
Try that again,

296
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,459
and I won't make it stop.

297
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,694
Ever.

298
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,062
I'm impressed.

299
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:28,199
Didn't think
you had that in you.

300
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,568
But you have to
take these off me

301
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,037
if you want to
find out the truth.

302
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,973
And why's that?

303
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,976
It'll look a little conspicuous
where we're going next.

304
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,048
Mm.
I was analyzing the particulates

305
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,284
that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez
left behind,

306
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,052
and I found
something very interesting.

307
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,989
When Clay's cells come into
contact with Shawna's,

308
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,992
they adopt her properties.

309
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,663
Something bothering you?

310
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,398
Why would you ask that?

311
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
You're doing that
biting-your-lower-lip thing

312
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,636
that you do
when something's bothering you.

313
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,237
I'm fine.

314
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,139
Okay.

315
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,442
Cisco says
I don't have a life.

316
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,144
You don't, do you?

317
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,279
I do!

318
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,447
I cook and I eat

319
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,750
and I read

320
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,418
and I help you.

321
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,187
So, what you're saying is,
you do everything

322
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,590
that has nothing to do with
having a life.

323
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,625
You don't have to be
rude about it.

324
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,527
Hey, I'm not doing any better

325
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,130
than you.
My social life consists of

326
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,465
running at superhuman speed
and Netflix.

327
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,868
We are quite the pair,
Mr. Allen.

328
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,636
Yes we are, Dr. Snow.

329
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,573
There's an armed robbery
in progress.

330
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,642
Two suspects,
male and female in their 20s.

331
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,911
Sounds like our meta-human
Bonnie and Clyde are

332
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:47,979
at it again.

333
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,881
Time to ruin
their social life.

334
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,358
Just a few bags, baby,
is enough to pay back Marcus.

335
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,029
These things are heavier
than they look.

336
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,942
Oh, I've read about you.

337
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,445
You're The Flash.

338
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,215
I've heard you're real fast.

339
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,817
Let's see if it's true.

340
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,821
Catch me if you can.

341
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,922
I can.

342
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,661
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

343
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,269
Not too many men can
keep up with me.

344
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,268
This is a bullet wound.

345
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,103
You're lucky it just barely
broke the skin.

346
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:23,708
Guess I'm a lot faster than
a speeding bullet.

347
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,610
Shawna Baez.

348
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,745
She can teleport.

349
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,781
As in, "Beam me up, Shawna?"

350
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,416
Yes, of course.

351
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,184
Quantum entanglement.

352
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,720
The ability to manipulate
interconnected particles

353
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,655
over an infinite distance.

354
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,223
Or, as Einstein put it,

355
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,325
"spooky action at a distance."

356
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,327
Every time I got close,
she'd disappear.

357
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,897
It was like we were playing
a game of...

358
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,398
Peek-a-boo.

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,734
Come on.
Can't I name one?

360
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,102
How am I supposed to catch her

361
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,770
if I don't know
where she's gonna be?

362
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,539
Everybody has limits,
Mr. Allen.

363
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,607
Now that we know
Shawna's powers,

364
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,910
we'll focus on those limits.

365
00:17:58,912 --> 00:17:59,944
All right.

366
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,279
Let me know.

367
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,413
I'm gonna change.

368
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,015
I gotta go help Iris.

369
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,490
Hey, Barry.

370
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,925
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

371
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,393
I thought I'd see if
you wanted help

372
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,761
writing your story
for the paper.

373
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,230
Oh, that is so sweet.
I would love to,

374
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,732
but we were about to have dinner
with Eddie's mom tonight.

375
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,101
And we're late.

376
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,669
Can we do it another time?

377
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,137
Yeah, yeah... yeah.

378
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,171
Okay.

379
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,439
- All right.
- Bye.

380
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,074
- See ya.
- Bye.

381
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,421
Hey.

382
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,291
What bars did
Shawna and Clay frequent?

383
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,727
Uh, mostly south side
dive bars.

384
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,795
Why?

385
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,964
I was just gonna check 'em out.

386
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,666
See if they fall into
any old habits.

387
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,835
That's a good idea.

388
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,470
I'll join you.

What?

395
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,190
What?
Nothing.

396
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,058
Uh, well, you look...

397
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,528
really nice.

398
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,331
I don't always dress like
a high school principal.

399
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,866
So, this is where

400
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,735
Shawna Baez and Clay Parker
used to hang out?

401
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,870
It is,
according to the files.

402
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,740
I thought we could
kill two birds with one stone.

403
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,177
Look for them and
get ourselves back out there.

404
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,649
I keep making
the same mistake.

405
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,385
Every time Iris falls,
I race to pick her up

406
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,521
thinking that one of these times
things are gonna change,

407
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,557
but I... things are never
gonna change.

408
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,794
I am just destined to be
just the friend.

409
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,298
At least you're not pining for
someone who bursts into flames

410
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,203
and wants nothing
to do with you.

411
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,671
What is wrong with us?

412
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,172
I mean, we're in our 20s.

413
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,241
We should be having fun.

414
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,243
We should meet people,

415
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,044
go on lots of dates.

416
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,313
Well,
here's to liquid courage.

417
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,249
♪ Everybody's working for
The weekend ♪

418
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,853
Uh... that is... very fast.

419
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,622
Drank all of it.

420
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,890
Excuse me?

421
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,459
I would like to start a tab.

422
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,634
CCPD confiscated everything
from S.T.A.R. Labs

423
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,902
after the explosion.

424
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,904
Video, audio,
traffic cam footage.

425
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,572
Okay, so?

426
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,208
I saw Martin Stein the night
S.T.A.R. Labs went boom.

427
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,911
He walked right past me.

428
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,881
You see, Stein specialized in
transmutation.

429
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,350
Molecular transmography.

430
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,218
Quantum splicing.

431
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,389
Taking two things
and making them one.

432
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,392
Let's go to the videotape,
shall we?

433
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,196
Okay, stop.

434
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,198
Now zoom in a few clicks.

435
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,569
Now advance it,
frame-by-frame.

436
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,442
His eyes.

437
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,079
They turned white,
just like Ronnie's.

438
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,314
Now, stop there.

439
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,149
In the mass of energy.

440
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,251
- Looks like...
- Ronnie.

441
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,887
And Professor Stein.

442
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,923
The dark matter
merged them together.

443
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,527
Explains why Ronnie hasn't
seemed quite himself lately.

444
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,730
It's because he's not.

445
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,766
He's Martin Stein.

446
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,468
Aah!

447
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,041
You can't say I didn't keep up
my end of the bargain.

448
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,251
I figure that makes us
even Stephen.

449
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,519
Adios.

450
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,690
Excuse me,
could I get some water?

451
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,291
Yo.

452
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,093
Excuse me?

453
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,096
- For real?
- Mr. Barry Allen!

454
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,831
Come on down!

455
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,832
- Or up.
- I'm not doing it.

456
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,966
Come up here with me.

457
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,601
Oh, come show 'em what you got.

458
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,803

Ooh, shh!

00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,983
You know I'm not
much of a singer.

464
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,418
And you're not
much of a drinker.

465
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,421
We are gonna

466
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,457

00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,008
Hey, Stevie.

485
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,610
Can my friend here tap out?

486
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,778
Sure thing, Linda.

487
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,549
Uh, thank you, Linda.

488
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,219
You're welcome, Barry.

489
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,089
How do you know my name?

490
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,892
"Barry. Barry. Barry."

491
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,660
Yeah...

492
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,995
Sorry about us up there.

493
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,029
That's...

494
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,597
Are you kidding?

495
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,766
No, that was some of
the best singing that I've heard

496
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,268
come from that stage.

497
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,936
You definitely
made my ears happy.

498
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,938
Don't worry.

499
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:03,507
Thanks.

500
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,645
So... was that
your girlfriend up there?

501
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,114
Oh... no, no.

502
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,582
She's a friend.

503
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,417
Okay.

504
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,391
Hey. Have you heard of
this new phone app?

505
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:21,992
It's so cool.

506
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,261
Check it out.
You just touch someone's phone

507
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,063
with your phone,
and it automatically

508
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,765
downloads your contact info.

509
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:28,933
Wow.

510
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,901
That is cool.

511
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,305
See?
You have my number.

512
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:41,278
What you do with it now is
up to you.

513
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,981
Okay.

514
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,082
- Barry?
- Yeah?

515
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,450
I don't feel good.

516
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,886
Okay.
Come on.

517
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,491
Okay?

518
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,866
80 grand.

519
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,734
What I owe.

520
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,339
So we square now?

521
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,341
Almost.

522
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:22,820
Ohh.

523
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,322
Holy crap.

524
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,191
I'm glad you're impressed.

525
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,726
So we cool now?

526
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,160
Absolutely.

527
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,330
Couldn't be cooler.

528
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:37,902
Which is why I think we need to
keep working together.

529
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,504
With what I know,

530
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,506
and what you can do,

531
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:47,511
oh, we can be looking at
a very lucrative future.

532
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,684
Police!
Everybody down!

533
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,428
Aah!

534
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,363
- Oh, baby!

535
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,100
Hold it right there.

536
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,208
Damn.

537
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,088
Are we still running?

538
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,724
No, we are here.

539
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,459
Vodka and super-speed...

540
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,027
not a good combination.

541
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,363
Come on.

542
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,199
So, are you gonna call her?

543
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
Who?

544
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,569
That girl.

545
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,938
The one who gave you
her number.

546
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,941
I hadn't really
thought about it.

547
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,776
Yes, you have.

548
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,446
But I know you.
You won't.

549
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,715
You'll let her slip
right through your fingers

550
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,085
because you think
you don't deserve happiness.

551
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:06,824
But what you don't realize is,
you need a little saving, too.

552
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:10,194
Little help, please.

553
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,597
W... yeah.
Okay.

554
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,167
There you go again.

555
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,103
Saving me from that
evil dress.

556
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,471
Get in bed.

557
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,339
Did you sneak a peek?

558
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,808
At my goods?

559
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,278
I wouldn't be much of a hero
if I did.

560
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,181
Yeah, but it's okay
if you peeked a little.

561
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,919
You deserve a peek for
all the good stuff you do.

562
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,122
Drink lots of water.

563
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,290
Thank you for tonight.

564
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,693
I sang.

565
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,496
Any time.

566
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,131
Hey, Barry?

567
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:50,467
Will you stay with me
until I fall asleep?

568
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,470
Sure, yeah.

569
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,251
Hi.

570
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,819
So loud.

571
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,654
Oh, ho-ho.

572
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,023
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

573
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,327
Let's just say I envy
your inability to get drunk.

574
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,329
I don't remember
much from last night.

575
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:23,333
Yeah,
that's probably for the best.

576
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,035
♪ Summer lovin' ♪

577
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,170
Oh, God.
That I do remember.

578
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,511
What's wrong?

579
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:39,216
Cisco... has something
he needs to tell you.

580
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,751
Hartley's gone.

581
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,653
He escaped
from the Pipeline?

582
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:46,523
How is that even possible?

583
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,726
I let him out.

584
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,160
Are you mad?

585
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,096
I can't tell with
those glasses on.

586
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,997
I'd like to yell
and wave my arms,

587
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,899
but I'm afraid I'd throw up.

588
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,167
Why?
What were you thinking?

589
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,569
You know how dangerous he is.

590
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,738
Hartley said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

591
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,406
I told you to let it go.

592
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,174
I didn't want you
looking into that for me.

593
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,442
I wasn't doing it for you.

594
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,444
I...

595
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,618
I sealed Ronnie into the
accelerator before it blew.

596
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,754
He told me to wait
two minutes,

597
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:21,725
and I waited,
but he didn't come back.

598
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,627
And I can't stop thinking,

599
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:28,332
10, 20 seconds and...

600
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,935
Ronnie wouldn't be like
he is right now.

601
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,938
I've wanted to tell you
so many times.

602
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,310
I'm so sorry.

603
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,313
So you carried that around
this whole time?

604
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:52,122
Do you know what
Ronnie would say if he was here?

605
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,125
He would say that
you did the right thing.

606
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,794
It wasn't your fault.

607
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,797
What happened that night
wasn't anybody's fault.

608
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,736
Come on.

609
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,572
Don't we have
a teleporter to catch?

610
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,341
We do have
a teleporter to catch.

611
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,913
And fortunately,
we do have a promising theory.

612
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,582
Take a look at this.

613
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,819
Now, this is the normal behavior

614
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,555
of the particulate
that Shawna left behind.

615
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:29,793
Watch what happens
when we remove light.

616
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,830
Shawna can only become entangled
with something she can see.

617
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,731
Take away her ability
to do that...

618
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:35,966
She can't teleport.

619
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,901
Exactly.

620
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,903
So, we just need to get her
into a dark space.

621
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,573
How do we do that?

622
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,141
It's a valid question.

623
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,143
Hello?

624
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,512
What?

625
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,646
Yeah, I'll be right there.

626
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,081
All right.

627
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,484
What's wrong?

628
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,652
M-my dad.

629
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,421
He's been stabbed.

630
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,564
Dad... what happened?

631
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,134
A rather stern reminder,
I'd say,

632
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,837
not to poke around
Marcus Stockheimer's business.

633
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,374
Dad, I told you to stop.

634
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,310
Your dad called me
with more intel.

635
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,548
It helped us track down Clay and
Shawna and arrest Stockheimer.

636
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,218
I managed to screw up
Marcus's big heist, too, so...

637
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,554
You two kept working together,
and you didn't tell me?

638
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,322
It isn't his fault.

639
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,491
I did it to help you.

640
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:39,363
You getting stabbed and beaten
is not helping me.

641
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,232
Look, I-I-I-I don't get to

642
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,137
feel useful very much in here.

643
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,172
So if I can help you
for a change,

644
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,975
I'm gonna want to
be there for you.

645
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,978
Just like you've been there
for me all these years.

646
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,452
Yep.

647
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,057
You said Marcus had
a big heist coming up?

648
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,392
Mm.

649
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,893
Do you know anything else
about it?

650
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,728
Dad, tell me
who did this to you.

651
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,930
No, it doesn't matter,
slugger.

652
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,398
But you said
you want to help me.

653
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,068
So help me.

654
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,537
One of Marcus's boys.

655
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,539
Julius.

656
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,353
What the hell?

657
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,356
Evening, Julius.

658
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,958
How'd I get out here?

659
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,359
You escaped.

660
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,361
They catch me trying to escape,

661
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,030
they're gonna add five years
to my sentence.

662
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,765
Ten, actually.

663
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,267
Unless you tell me where

664
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,935
Marcus Stockheimer's next
job is gonna be.

665
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,206
Oh! Guards will be here
any second.

666
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,441
I'd start blabbing.

667
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,543
Okay!

668
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,911
Okay.

669
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:03,313
It's a TDK
and money transfer truck

670
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,949
coming from the federal reserve
bank in St. Louis.

671
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,251
Supposed to be millions.

672
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,020
Delivery's around 8:00.

673
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,621
That's all I know.
I swear.

674
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,023
That's right now.

675
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,461
Hey!

676
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,462
Hey, what about me?

677
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,040
I think we got company.

678
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,811
What the...

679
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,753
Okay.

680
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,755
Let's go.

681
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,335
I got this.

682
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,506
Why the hell
do you care what we do?

683
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,107
Are you a cop or something?

684
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,942
Something.

685
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,233
Come on!

686
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,388
Barry, remember: she cannot
teleport if she cannot see.

687
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,823
Limit her field of vision.

688
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,637
No.

689
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,925
He left me.

690
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,843
Is there any way she can
teleport out of this?

691
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,311
It's impossible.

692
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,346
It's one-way glass.

693
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,281
It's mirrored on the inside.

694
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,284
No one dangerous is ever gonna
get out of this thing again.

695
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,725
Shawna.

696
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,293
Clay left you.

697
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,495
He's out there,
and you're in here.

698
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,899
You know what
the crazy thing is?

699
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:10,400
I still love him.

700
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,575
Cisco.

701
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,184
Crazy is right.

702
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:31,354
Some people are worth
being crazy for.

703
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,392
I'm sorry if I was a bit of
a drunken mess the other night.

704
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,060
Actually, it was pretty fun.

705
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,529
Yeah, it was.

706
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,731
You know what?

707
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,234
I think everybody's been right
about you and me.

708
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:48,672
Both of us have been hung up
on people for way too long.

709
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,574
If what Cisco says is true,

710
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,910
that Ronnie merged
with Martin Stein,

711
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:58,682
then he's not alive anymore.

712
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,684
Time for me to move on.

713
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,753
Find someone new
to be crazy about.

714
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,629
All right, well.

715
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,763
I'll see you tomorrow.

716
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,599
Yes, sure.

717
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,601
Bye.

718
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,034
Bye.

719
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,551
That's for you.

720
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,119
I thought maybe
you could help me out,

721
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,121
if you're willing.

722
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,026
This is about
the breakout at Iron Heights.

723
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,395
Clay Parker.
He's still on the loose,

724
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,963
and we need to catch him.

725
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,566
Why are you giving this to me?

726
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,636
'Cause you're a good reporter.

727
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,638
And the only one I know.

728
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,878
You're not the only one
who's fast.

729
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,950
Hey, what are you doing here?

730
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,118
- Hey.
- If you came to check on me,

731
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,452
that is really sweet,

732
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,255
but I think
everything's gonna be okay.

733
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,157
I'm glad.
Uh...

734
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,793
I actually am not here
to see you.

735
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,328
No?

736
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,530
No, I have a lunch date.

737
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,432
With who?

738
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,100
- Ready.
- Hey.

739
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,536
Oh, hey,
you're our new stringer, right?

740
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,704
Yeah.

741
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,472
I'm Linda Park.
Sports.

742
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,441
Iris West.

743
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,444
How did you two meet?

744
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,112
Well, it's actually
kind of a funny story.

745
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,113
Yeah, I'll tell you later,
all right?

746
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,115
- You ready?
- Yeah.

747
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,649
- Okay.
- See ya.

748
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,484
Have fun.

749
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,258
So an actual date this time.

750
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,627
Good for you.

751
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:54,431
You didn't tell her
your dad's in the slammer?

752
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:57,767
No, I read in a magazine that
that's a big turnoff.

753
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,769
Smart.

754
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,173
Hey.

755
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,275
You see this?

756
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,576
No.

757
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,611
I haven't.

758
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:12,682
The Flash.

759
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,351
I saw him once.

760
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,986
In here.

761
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,556
Watched him save
Joe's life.

762
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,590
Joe told me about that.

763
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,758
I guess he was lucky.

764
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,226
Hm.

765
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,228
Lucky Joe.

766
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,499
The strangest thing.

767
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,935
I get roughed up by Julius,
end up in here.

768
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,371
Next thing I know, Julius is
caught trying to escape,

769
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,740
claims The Flash
broke him out.

770
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:41,878
Won't be seeing Julius for
a long time now.

771
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,050
Guess I'm lucky too, huh?

772
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,753
Dad.

773
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,922
If I was The Flash,

774
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,993
don't you think that you'd be
the first to know about it?

775
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,395
Yeah.

776
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,401
Well, if The Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

777
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,503
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world,

778
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,505
so be careful.

779
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,010
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

780
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,213
And he's saving a lot of lives.

781
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:22,986
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel,

782
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:25,989
is that
his father's proud of him.

783
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,237
Power grid's been going haywire
in this sector.

784
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,006
The system's so antiquated.

785
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,236
Whoa.

786
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,838
What was that?

787
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,765
Aah!

788
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,408
Aah!

789
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,300
Greg, move your head.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,776
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,946
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,115
by something impossible.

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,151
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,321
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,558
To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,962
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,497
and find others like me.

9
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,999
And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,568
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,604
That day is today.

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,545
What?
No Big Belly Burger?

13
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,447
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

14
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,982
We're out of cows
where I come from.

15
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,185
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

16
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,121
Not sure where to start...
Thawne.

17
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,358
That is your real name...
Eobard Thawne.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,060
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

19
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,594
136 years from now.

20
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,698
That's not what
you want to know.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,835
Go ahead, Barry.

22
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,103
Ask it.

23
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,940
Why did you kill
my mother?

24
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,042
Because I hate you.

25
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,211
Not you now.
You years from now.

26
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,281
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

27
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,183
We're enemies, rivals,
opposites,

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,451
reverses of one another.

29
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,186
Why?
Wh-why were we enemies?

30
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,788
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,524
It doesn't...
matter anymore.

32
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,593
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

33
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,362
to defeat the other.

34
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,099
Until I learned your secret.

35
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,835
I learned your name.

36
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,504
Barry Allen.

37
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,374
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

38
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,278
Travel back in time,
kill you as a child.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,148
Wipe you
from the face of the earth.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,085
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

41
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,020
and we fought.

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,858
We both landed
some pretty solid shots.

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,829
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

44
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,599
I was so mad.

45
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,370
But then I thought...

46
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,207
what if you were
to suffer a tragedy?

47
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,911
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

48
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,514
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

49
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,049
Then you would not become
The Flash.

50
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,253
And so I stabbed your mother
in the heart,

51
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,854
and I was free.

52
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,725
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

53
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,996
only to realize
that in traveling back

54
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,698
I'd lost my way home.

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,068
Lost my ability to harness
the speed force.

56
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,505
And without it,
I was stuck here.

57
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,542
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

58
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:01,180
And the only way back
was The Flash.

59
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,716
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,024
Why train me?

61
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,593
Why help me save
so many people?

62
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,330
Because I needed you
to get fast.

63
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:23,001
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

64
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,970
and create
a stable wormhole

65
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,973
through which
I could return home.

66
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,575
Why would I
ever do that?

67
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,043
Because...

68
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:36,281
Barry Allen,
if you give me what I want,

69
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,517
I'm gonna give you
what you want.

70
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,722
You can go back
and save your mother.

71
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,925
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

72
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,629
You can reunite
the Allen family.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,434
No.

74
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,836
No, I don't
believe you.

75
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,341
I want to kill you
right now.

76
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,042
I know that rage.

77
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,778
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

78
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,649
And now, somehow,

79
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:15,687
I know
what Joe and Henry feel

80
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,890
when they look on you
with pride.

81
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,125
With love.

82
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,293
No. No.

83
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,162
Don't you
ever say that to me!

84
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,031
I know you're upset,

85
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,134
but I'm giving you
a chance.

86
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:35,207
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

87
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,743
Don't you want that chance?

88
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,594
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

89
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,830
and save your mother's life...

90
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,767
Quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

91
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,970
The chance to be
with someone you love?

92
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,838
Seems pretty cut and dry
to me.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,541
At first blush, Dr. Snow,
it would appear so,

94
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:14,680
but this gift
has unparalleled risk.

95
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,748
Barry, the night
your mother died,

96
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,817
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

97
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,555
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

98
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,757
and changed
the course of history.

99
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,328
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

100
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,496
Just like when
I time travelled before.

101
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,899
But he... he only changed
one day that time.

102
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:39,771
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

103
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,040
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

104
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,343
impacts everything that follows.

105
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,312
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices.

106
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:51,783
No relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

107
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,352
and you'd never know
the difference

108
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,455
because you'd never
remember any of it.

109
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:03,328
So if I go back
and save my mom,

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,165
my dad doesn't go to prison.

111
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,502
I never live
with Joe and Iris.

112
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:15,807
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

113
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:20,078
Truth is,
there's no real way

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,482
of knowing what
your life will be.

115
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,323
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

116
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,658
You gotta change the past.

117
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,467
Joe?

118
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,438
So what...
What, that's it?

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,007
You think I should
just do it?

120
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,912
Yeah, I do.

121
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,449
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

122
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,718
you're okay with that?

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,422
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

124
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,624
You don't have to grow up
without a mother.

125
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,192
What about growing up
without a father?

126
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:11,897
You will have a father...
Your real father.

127
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,101
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

128
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,970
This is why you became
The Flash, Barry.

129
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,872
To put things right.

130
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:26,211
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

131
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,046
Now it's time
to save yours.

132
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,736
Dad, look.
I know this sounds crazy.

133
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,206
I think
we're way past crazy, slugger.

134
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,710
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

135
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,079
No, I wouldn't be
turning time back.

136
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,716
I would be...
going back

137
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,285
to that night
to save her.

138
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,922
And what does Joe think
about all this?

139
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,160
He thinks
I should do it.

140
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,195
No.

141
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,763
You can't.

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,835
Dad...

143
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:29,241
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

144
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,742
We'll be a family again.

145
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,244
We are a family.

146
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,913
Not like this.
Not without Mom.

147
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,118
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

148
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,686
Things happen the way they do.

149
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,788
We may not know why
at the time,

150
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,924
but there must always be
a reason.

151
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,394
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

152
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:54,099
I... I can save Mom.

153
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,568
At what cost?

154
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,104
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

155
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,439
- I don't care.
- I do.

156
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,012
I am in awe

157
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:11,583
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

158
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:15,020
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

159
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,354
but you, Barry.

160
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,024
Your honesty.
Your heart.

161
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,495
You were always a hero.

162
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,165
And your mom would be
just as proud.

163
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,100
And if she had a say in this,

164
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,469
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

165
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,239
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

166
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,641
she would never want that.

167
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,114
Barry, what I hope for you,

168
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,618
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,190
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

170
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,392
And then you will know...

171
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,933
How much I truly love you.

172
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,008
98.6. Normal.

173
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,077
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

174
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,712
Me neither.

175
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,980
I know Barry
really appreciates you

176
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,648
coming back to help him
stop Wells.

177
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,284
That's not the only reason
I'm back, Cait.

178
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,152
I'm here now.
For good.

179
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,721
But I thought...

180
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,256
I thought too...
I thought too much

181
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,093
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

182
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,562
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

183
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,765
If we hurt you.

184
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:39,804
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

185
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,474
I'm not whole
unless I'm with you.

186
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,643
I love you, Cait.

187
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,515
- Are you sure?
- I am.

188
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,320
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

189
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,322
you agreed to marry me.

190
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,189
Yes, I did.

191
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,525
What do you say
we do that?

192
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,169
Thought I might find you here.

193
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,041
I needed to get
out of the lab.

194
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,280
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

195
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,682
Oh, it is.
Trust me.

196
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,719
I've done a lot
of thinking up here.

197
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,454
When I wasn't having
clandestine meetings

198
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,057
with the mysterious
"streak."

199
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,228
Yeah, not mad
we lost that name.

200
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,631
Hey, I thought that
had pizzazz.

201
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,902
- No.
- Uh-uh.

202
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,077
So are you gonna do it?

203
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,650
It's just so... huge.

204
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,185
It's the biggest decision
of my life,

205
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:04,422
and if I'm wrong,
I can't undo it.

206
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,091
Why would you
want to?

207
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:12,163
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,100
have a great career,

209
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,002
even get married.

210
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,006
Iris West-Allen, huh?

211
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,776
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

212
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,946
Must be a 2024 thing.

213
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,016
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

214
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:37,455
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

215
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,657
that's why things
are different there?

216
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,727
Growing up together and...

217
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:47,866
knowing so much
about each other...

218
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:52,036
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

219
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,142
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

220
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,249
But living with you
and Joe...

221
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,854
I've had a great life,
Iris.

222
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,692
Come here,
Barry.

223
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,535
What do you think
I should do?

224
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,637
I need someone to tell me.

225
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,811
I think...

226
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,447
that for once in your life,
Barry Allen,

227
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,917
you should stop thinking
about other people.

228
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,353
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

229
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,889
Do what you need to do
for yourself.

230
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,033
Ah!

231
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,069
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

232
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,637
it took you a whole hour
longer to decide

233
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,639
than I thought it would.

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,409
So how does this work?

235
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,045
Your grand plan?

236
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,414
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

237
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,082
In fact, it's rather simple.

238
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,617
We use
the Particle Accelerator.

239
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,085
The Particle Accelerator.

240
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,955
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

241
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,690
that hurt a lot of people.

242
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,893
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

243
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,528
the way it was designed to.

244
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,099
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

245
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,101
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

246
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,770
we're only going
to inject one particle

247
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,806
into the accelerator.

248
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,942
And I'm what
it collides with.

249
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,211
And if you can go fast enough,
Barry,

250
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,915
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

251
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,118
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,222
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

253
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,958
to infinite times.

254
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,293
A wormhole.

255
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,897
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

256
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,067
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

257
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,670
my time.

258
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,873
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

259
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,475
What happens if I don't?

260
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,312
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

261
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,747
you'll die.

262
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,788
According to
Wells' calculations,

263
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,491
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

264
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,027
Once Barry
reaches optimum speed,

265
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,764
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

266
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,234
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

267
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:40,471
opening a gateway
into time itself.

268
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,874
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

269
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,710
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

270
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,212
I'm uncommitted.

271
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,615
What do you think?

272
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,584
I mean, on the one hand,

273
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,620
it does make a kind of sense.

274
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,355
On the other hand,

275
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,690
why?

276
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,459
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

277
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,027
You know why.

278
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,863
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

279
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,834
By my estimates,
Mach Two at a minimum.

280
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,903
You've never gone that fast.

281
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,872
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

282
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,408
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

283
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,510
How far off am I?

284
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,546
Not very far,
I'm afraid.

285
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,983
Let me worry about
how fast I have to go.

286
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,150
We're gonna need
something else too.

287
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,219
Really?
And what's that?

288
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,088
'Cause I don't know
about you guys,

289
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,992
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

290
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,362
I need you to build
a time machine.

291
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,864
Go on.

292
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,733
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

293
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,735
what's he need
a time machine for?

294
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,270
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

295
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,007
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

296
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,274
He can't fully
control it.

297
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,709
So I was right
about the wheelchair.

298
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,244
He was using it
to charge himself.

299
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,546
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

300
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,949
to travel back
to the future.

301
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,851
He's been squirreling away
the parts.

302
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,652
Now we just need
to put it together.

303
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,856
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

304
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
not a bookcase from IKEA.

305
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
We got a problem.

306
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,994
These tiles...
They're made of tungsten.

307
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,362
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

308
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,764
of any other element.

309
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,899
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

310
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,534
The pressure exerted
from the wormhole...

311
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,969
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,105
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

313
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,408
It could explode.

314
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,043
Any ideas?

315
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,745
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

316
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,681
Which used to be
a name that made me smile.

317
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,389
Something on your mind,
Cisco?

318
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,591
No.

319
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,793
Yes.

320
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,595
How did you fit
your Reverse-Flash suit

321
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,963
into that little ring?

322
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,099
Is it some sort
of compressed micro tech?

323
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,702
Or actually, forget it.
I don't care.

324
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,406
Maybe a little.

325
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,908
Ronnie's right.

326
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,876
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

327
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,179
Glad we're still good
for something.

328
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:05,183
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

329
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,417
Or Ronnie's.

330
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,019
As a matter of fact,

331
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,689
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

332
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,024
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

333
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,258
It would have been
a lot more fun.

334
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,159
Yeah?

335
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,961
Well, doesn't change the fact

336
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,664
that your nifty little
Time Sphere...

337
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,065
Is that what you're calling it?

338
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,834
Whatever it's called.
It's gonna blow.

339
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,836
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

340
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,372
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

341
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,375
Okay. Fine.
We'll try that.

342
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,010
That's it? That's all?

343
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,011
Well, what do you
want me to say?

344
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,713
I don't know, Cisco.

345
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,448
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

346
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,416
of my predicament.

347
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,685
I don't belong here.

348
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,855
These barbaric times.

349
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,389
It's like
living amongst the dead.

350
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:49,160
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

351
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,465
What?

352
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,967
What did you say?

353
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,505
It was an alternate timeline.

354
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,573
One that Barry reset.

355
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,242
But I never forgot it.

356
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:08,079
It just kept
coming back to me.

357
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,249
And I can still picture

358
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,651
the way you looked at me

359
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,287
when you called me a son

360
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,392
and you crushed my heart
with your fist.

361
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,495
Cisco...

362
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,466
Yeah.
It sucked.

364
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,368
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

365
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,537
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

366
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,105
of another timeline.

367
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,375
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

368
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,710
It means...

369
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,513
I wasn't sure
until just now.

370
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,781
Sure of what?

371
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,487
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

372
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,926
You were affected too.

373
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,964
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,067
No.

375
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,904
I wasn't.

376
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,774
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

377
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:15,246
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

378
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:20,718
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

379
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,421
that you remember
who gave you that life.

380
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,327
And that it was given
out of love.

381
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,043
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

382
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,312
with enough power
to run these calculations.

383
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,481
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

384
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,949
Say no more.

385
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,451
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

386
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,885
but it seems
I'm only in the way.

387
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,623
Everyone has
a contribution to make.

388
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,158
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

389
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,927
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

390
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,395
about the future.

391
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,997
I don't matter.

392
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,199
As far as history's concerned,

393
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,301
I don't save the day
or get the girl.

394
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,803
And you believed him?

395
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,073
He had a newspaper
from the year 2024.

396
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:19,443
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

397
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,446
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify

398
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,583
to its authenticity.

399
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:31,622
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

400
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,294
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

401
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,762
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

402
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,530
Me?

403
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,867
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

404
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,069
and get stuck
in the exact same city

405
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,105
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

406
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,475
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

407
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,512
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

408
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:58,683
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

409
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:04,655
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

410
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,791
Which is?

411
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,026
Coincidence.

412
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:13,964
There is no science
to coincidence.

413
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,468
You, sir, are an anomaly.

414
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,138
A wild card, as it were.

415
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,041
You are the only person
in this whole story

416
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,912
who gets to choose
his own future.

417
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,848
At least, that's my opinion.

418
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,119
Wait, that can't be right.

419
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,588
Oh, dear.

420
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,590
- We have a problem.
- What?

421
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,859
The calculations.
There is a danger.

422
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,261
I know.
I'm ready to take the risk.

423
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,164
No, not just to you
but to everyone.

424
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,933
Wells didn't tell us everything.

425
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,370
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

426
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,305
colliding
with the hydrogen particle,

427
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:59,543
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

428
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,545
What's a singularity?

429
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,445
It's a black hole.

430
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,514
We could destroy
Central City.

431
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,882
For starters.

432
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:10,020
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

433
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:14,191
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

434
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:18,329
So long and thanks
for all the fish.

435
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,536
Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

436
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,171
I would hardly refer
to possibly causing

437
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,506
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

438
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,374
Yeah, and your accelerator's

439
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:33,043
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

440
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,045
Let me ask you a question.

441
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,682
How many meta-humans...

442
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,917
How many dangers...

443
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,287
Have we faced
this year together?

444
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,656
Or did you forget
that was me

445
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,092
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

446
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,661
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

447
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,129
It will work.

448
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,031
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

449
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,466
in the middle
of Central City?

450
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:58,102
So, once the wormhole
stabilizes,

451
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:02,039
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

452
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,908
and return to this time.

453
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,609
If and when he does that,

454
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,611
you can close the wormhole,

455
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,613
and we can all live
happily ever after.

456
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,948
Almost two minutes.

457
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,050
More than enough time
to save Nora.

458
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,187
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

459
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,556
Everything's a choice.

460
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,624
And what if I'm late?

461
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,427
You won't be.
I believe in you, Barry.

462
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,228
Always have.

463
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,863
So I guess the question is,

464
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,933
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

465
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,656
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

466
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,025
then I'm dust,
and if I do run fast enough

467
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,994
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

468
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,530
swallow up the city
and possibly the world.

469
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,800
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

470
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:05,069
this is for the best?

471
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,339
I'd be lying
if I told you I did.

472
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,311
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

473
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,646
I thought
you were the sure one.

474
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,548
I...

475
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,450
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

476
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,019
the first time.

477
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,021
I was faking it.

478
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,256
Sometimes parents do that.

479
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,425
Most of the time,
parents do that.

480
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,531
Look, of course I'm scared.

481
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,968
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

482
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,503
because you were worried
about me.

483
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,072
Well, I'll always worry
about you, Joe,

484
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,308
just like you'll always worry
about me.

485
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,011
Sorry,
but you can't stop that.

486
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,219
Do you think I can do this?

487
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,389
You think
I can save my mom?

488
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,324
I mean, do you think
I'm fast enough?

489
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,392
Yes.

490
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,428
I know you are.

491
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:12,836
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

492
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,205
saving her,

493
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,609
freeing my dad, and...

494
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,011
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

495
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,279
Barry...

496
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,583
Joe, it's true.
It's true.

497
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,252
I've always been
so focused on everything

498
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:33,557
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

499
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,395
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

500
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,130
another.

501
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,768
And I don't think
I can lose you.

502
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,504
You won't ever
lose me.

503
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,507
Ever, you hear me?

504
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,309
Ever.

505
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,019
Wow, slow news day?

506
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,558
If they only knew, right?

507
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,028
I thought you would be
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

508
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,496
I was.

509
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,732
Then I got hungry,
so I went to Mama Chows.

510
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,035
For dim sum?
Your favorite.

511
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,404
And to remind myself
of something.

512
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,406
What?

513
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:30,214
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

514
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:34,051
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

515
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,888
Katie Rogers.
She was a dancer.

516
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,124
We had plans to meet
at Mama Chows,

517
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,458
but she texted me.

518
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,926
She pulled a hamstring
and had to cancel.

519
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,496
Oh, those fragile dancers.

520
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,833
I was bummed 'cause I was
looking forward to it.

521
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,903
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home

522
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:57,107
when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

523
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,876
Your backpack.

524
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,812
And I arrested him.

525
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,448
That's how you and I met.

526
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,950
I remember.

527
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,020
Someone just told me how
powerful a coincidence can be,

528
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,124
and it made me realize how many
coincidences had to happen

529
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,027
for you and I to get together...

530
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,264
in this time.

531
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:24,034
We've all been so focused on
Barry's destiny,

532
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,104
I forgot that I have one too.

533
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,010
And it's you.

534
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:36,146
Iris West,

535
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:40,851
every moment of my life
led to meeting you.

536
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,456
Screw the future.

537
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,194
Screw the future.

538
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,901
Is this actually binding?

539
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,672
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

540
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,641
This will be "legit,"
as the kids say.

541
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,076
No kids say that.

542
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,277
Let's not fight
on our wedding day.

546
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,625
I've learned a lot

547
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,995
about merging one's life
with another this past year.

548
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,799
Yet, for all the incredible
advancements in science

549
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,400
we've all been party to,

550
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:34,171
the mystery that brings
two people together through love

551
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,907

who saved younger you
from the Reverse-Flash

and now<i> you</i> you.

579
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:55,118
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there,

580
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,654
and then you can go
and save your mom.

581
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,123
Piece of cake.

582
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,459

00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,199

00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,372
Good-bye, Son.

585
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,642
Iris...

586
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,311
You don't have
to say anything.

587
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,913
I already know.

588
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,288
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you.

589
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,457
That it makes
you happy.

590
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,558
You too.

591
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,880
Remember, Mr. Allen,

592
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,549
assuming you achieve the proper
velocity and open the wormhole,

593
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,719
you will only have
1 minute and 52 seconds

594
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,755
to save your mother
and return.

595
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,757
Or else...

596
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,224
I know.

597
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,562
Well...

598
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:16,266
you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

599
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,902
And I know you can do it.

600
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,237
Now...

601
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,040
Run...

602
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,142
Barry.

603
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,443
Run.

604
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,221
The accelerator's structural
integrity is holding.

605
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,057
What was that?

606
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,258
Is Barry okay?

607
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,695
Yeah.
He just passed Mach Two.

608
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,740
I was waiting for you
to bring Barry home.

609
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:00,677
Looks like he's going to be
staying with us for a while.

610
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,113
Barry, what you're seeing is
the Speed Force:

611
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,283
your past, you present,
your future

612
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,818
all at once.

613
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,421
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

614
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,890
So think about...

615
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,926
that night.

616
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:19,730
Think about your mother.

617
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:23,033
Time for bed.
Good night, slugger.

618
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,535
Mom!

619
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,008
It's working.

620
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,479
It's working.

621
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,349
Inject the hydrogen particle
now.

622
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,088
What's that?
What happened?

623
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,356
Barry... he's gone.

624
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,225
- Look.
- The wormhole.

625
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,993
And it's stable.
Start the clock.

626
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,581
Mom!

627
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,083
Mom!

628
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,085
Barry!

629
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,819
Mom!

630
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:21,391
Nora! Hold on!

631
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:33,970
Run, Barry, run!

632
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,108
Barry, no!

633
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,712
No, no, no!

634
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,338
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

635
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,607
Please. My husband,
my son, are they...

636
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,409
They're okay.

637
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,944
They're both safe.

638
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,713
I promise.

639
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,748
Who are you?

640
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,017
I'm...

641
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,156
I'm The Flash.

642
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,924
I don't understand.

643
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,973
You look
just like my father.

644
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,448
This won't make
any sense,

645
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,917
but it's me, Mom.

646
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,786
It's Barry.

647
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:57,788
Barry?

648
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,222
Your Barry.

649
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,991
Oh, my beautiful boy.

650
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,064
I got a second chance

651
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,067
to come back here and...

652
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,640
Tell you that I'm okay.

653
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:20,577
Dad and I are
both okay.

654
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,314
And we love you, Mom.

655
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,917
I love you.

656
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,419
I love you.

657
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,856
Oh, my sweet boy.

658
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:36,126
Bye. Good-bye.

659
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:39,462
Good-bye, Barry.

660
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,632
Mom.

661
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,569
Mom.

662
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,794
I believe it's time to
say good-bye to Harrison Wells.

663
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,768
It's beautiful.

664
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,705
Rip Hunter would
be impressed.

665
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,907
He built
the first one of these.

666
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,542
Interesting man.

667
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,715
Now what the hell
is that?

668
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,917
That's my cue to leave.

669
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,456
Thank you, Cisco.

670
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,491
Don't ever come back.

671
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,083
30 seconds.

672
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,726
Home.

673
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,874
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

674
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,176
We have to shut down
the wormhole quickly!

675
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,046
Caitlin!

676
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,055
You didn't save her.

677
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,690
Why?

678
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:47,991
Why?

679
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,627
You could have had
the life you wanted.

680
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,863
You could have had
everything you ever wanted!

681
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,900
I already do.

682
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,639
Not for long.

683
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,777
Cut the internal generators.

684
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,048
Ten seconds, hurry.

685
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,065
Three, two, one.

686
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,369
Ronnie, are you okay?

687
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,703
Did you do it?

688
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,205
Yes, I turned them
all off.

689
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,210
They did it.
They cut the generator.

690
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,683
Just so we're clear,

691
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,118
after I kill you,

692
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,786
I'm going to kill them.

693
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,055
And then I'm going
to kill your father.

694
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,225
I always win, Flash.

695
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,300
Eddie! Oh, my...

696
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,003
Eddie!

697
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,638
What did you do?

698
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,878
What did you do?
What did you do?

699
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,747
No such thing
as a coincidence.

700
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,085
What's happening?

701
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,720
Cisco, help me.

702
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:26,289
Eddie's his ancestor.

703
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,958
If Eddie dies,
he'll never be born, and...

704
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,263
He's being erased
from existence.

705
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,635
No! No!
Eddie.

706
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,236
Eddie, no, no.

707
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,306
Stay with me, okay?
Stay.

708
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,976
He was wrong,
it turns out.

709
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,678
I'm a hero after all.

710
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,748
You are, Eddie.
You are my hero.

711
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,151
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

712
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,719
Your hero.

713
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,561
No!

714
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:13,903
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

715
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,973
How will you get along
without me?

716
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,535
Guys, that's not good.

717
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,036
Professor, I shut down
the wormhole.

718
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,172
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

719
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,741
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

720
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,309
We got to go.

721
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,712
You okay?

722
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,146
Iris, we have to go.

723
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,816
I'm not leaving him.

724
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,385
We have to go now, honey.
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,637
So that's what
we didn't want to happen.

726
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,372
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

727
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:26,743
A singularity won't stop, not
even after the earth is gone.

728
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,465
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

729
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,467
What?

730
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,901
The diffuse material

731
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,670
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

732
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,704
What does that mean?

733
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,539
We have to disrupt the motion.

734
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,809
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

735
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,411
And bigger.

736
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,046
And scarier.

737
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:04,881
Barry, that event
has an energy level

738
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,417
of at least
6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

739
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,885
It cannot be stopped.

740
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,891
I have to try.

741
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,515
Oh, God.

742
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,618
Barry.

743
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,296
Move your head.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
