1
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:02,838
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,996
Maybe I'm finally ready
to admit that I still have

3
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:06,315
feelings for you, too.

4
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,373
No! Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,709
My father, he told me
that he failed the city,

6
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,811
but I never knew
what he meant until now.

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,597
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

8
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:26,523
Oh, no!

9
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:29,776
You can survive this.

10
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,528
Make it home.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,280
Make it better.

12
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:36,416
Right my wrongs.

13
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,975
Dad?!

14
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,294
Survive.

15
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,262
No! No!

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,678
I hope I didn't hurt you.

17
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,401
At least I can properly thank you
now for saving my life.

18
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,536
If I only knew

19
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:17,540
how you were
spending your nights...

20
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:21,294
My hope is that I can
explain everything to you

21
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:23,529
to help you understand.

22
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,715
You murdered my father!

23
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,669
You sentenced me
to that island,

24
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:32,973
to five years of hell.

25
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,142
I am truly sorry
for what happened to you.

26
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:41,431
You know I have
lost people.

27
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,216
Yeah, your wife.

28
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,151
Do you really think

29
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,271
that you're honoring
Tommy's mother

30
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:51,825
by destroying
the Glades?

31
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:53,334
As surely as you believe

32
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,476
you're honoring your father
with this hood.

33
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,565
Not a day goes by

34
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,368
I don't miss your father.

35
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,287
You'll see him soon.

36
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,878
You can't beat me, Oliver.

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,346
Yes, you're younger.

38
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,964
You're faster,

39
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,917
but you always seem
to come up short against me.

40
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,053
Want to know why?

41
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:23,523
Because you don't know,

42
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,027
in your heart,
what you're fighting for.

43
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:31,764
What you're willing
to sacrifice, and I do.

44
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,238
No one can stop
what's about to come.

45
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:44,444
Not even the Vigilante.

46
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,511
The plane's holding steady
at 33,000 feet.

47
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,898
That's the range
for missile intercept, sir.

48
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,268
Lock missile one
on target.

49
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,354
Missile one locked
on the jet's heat trail.

50
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,407
Prepare to launch
on my mark.

51
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,026
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,378
Fire! Fire the missile now!

53
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:42,848
I take back every joke

54
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,147
I made about you sticking
a tracking device in your boot.

Felicity's
at Queen Consolidated.

58
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,711
She's still going through the data
she pulled off Merlyn's network.

59
00:04:58,713 --> 00:04:59,929
Did she find
anything?

60
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,381
Yeah, the design
schematics

61
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:02,748
of the earthquake
generator.

62
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,434
So we can shut it down.

63
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,019
Assuming
we find it in time.

64
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,689
Yeah, Felicity,
I got him.

65
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,058
Thank God.
Is he ok?

66
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,143
Mostly.
Ok.

67
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,695
I'm on my way.

68
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:18,264
Miss Smoak.

69
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,321
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

70
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,277
Please.

71
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,664
Take a seat.

72
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,883
You know, I think
I'd rather stand.

73
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,920
You're not exactly
a hardened criminal, are you?

74
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,472
No, I'm not
any kind of criminal.

75
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,457
What do you call
computer hacking?

76
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,676
A hobby?

77
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,312
That I do not engage in.

78
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,368
Hey, I got a whole mess

79
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,684
of computer gobbedly gook
that I don't understand,

80
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,735
but it says otherwise.

81
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,678
I had my tech guys
go through your computer

82
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,179
at Queen Consolidated.

83
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,475
You used it to hack into
blackhawk squad security

84
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,494
to research arrows shipped to
a company called Sagittarius

85
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:07,023
and to analyze a water
sample to tie back

86
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:07,948
to a Vertigo drug lab.

87
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,250
These are all cases

88
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:13,819
involving...The Hood.

89
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,039
Tell me, Felicity.

90
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,124
What am I thinking?

91
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,762
Saved by the bell.

92
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,098
Excuse me.

93
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,468
Hello, Detective.

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,186
It's funny
you should call.

95
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,906
I got your trusty sidekick sitting
right in front of me.

96
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,140
I don't have a sidekick.

97
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,392
When I need help,
I call you.

98
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,562
Malcolm Merlyn plans to level
the Glades with a manmade earthquake

99
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:43,349
using technology
from Unidac Industries.

100
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,369
What?

101
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,122
Now you're just
trying to have some fun with me.

102
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,324
I don't know what
Merlyn's timetable is,

103
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,493
so you need to evacuate
the Glades immediately.

104
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,545
Get as many people
to safety as you can.

105
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,797
Whatever you think
of me, Detective,

106
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,751
please...believe this.

107
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,774
Sounds like you have
bigger problems than me.

108
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,481
Don't leave town.

109
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,554
You know...

110
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,524
I used to think the Vigilante
was a criminal, too,

111
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,410
but it seems to me,
whoever he is,

112
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,362
he's willing to sacrifice
an awful lot

113
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:33,249
to help the people
of this city.

114
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,401
Kind of makes him
a hero...

115
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,036
Doesn't it?

116
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:41,061

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,847
Look who it is.

119
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,484
My best friend in life.

120
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,885
Hey, buddy.

121
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,906
I took your advice,
you know.

122
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:03,660
I went to Laurel's,
to fight for her.

123
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,279
So imagine my surprise

124
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:09,332
seeing you there,
kissing her.

125
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,567
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,002
No, you're not.

127
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,876
Something's happening,
and it involves your father.

128
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,211
Keep my father
out of this.

129
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,131
Our fathers.
They aren't the men

130
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,016
we thought they were.

131
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,686
They made a plan together...

132
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:33,439
to destroy the Glades.

133
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,360
Do you have any idea
what you sound like right now?

134
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,696
Your father's going to do it.

135
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,900
Because he thinks
it will avenge your mother's death.

136
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,736
Do not talk about
my mother!

137
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,912
The difference

138
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,548
between us, Tommy,

139
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,385
is that I didn't find out the truth
about my father

140
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:05,254
until it was too late.

141
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,674
But you've always known,

142
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:10,292
deep down,

143
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:14,964
you have always known
the man he is.

144
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:21,738
I wish you would have
died on that island.

145
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,273
We need to reprogram
the missile.

146
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,892
I don't know how to reprogram
a missile launcher!

147
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:04,513
I do.
Watch out!

148
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,695
Oliver, put the chip in.

149
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:11,097
Make it quick,
I got a comm stat meeting in five.

150
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,882
I don't want to be late for
my own funeral.

151
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,634
I've got it under
good authority

152
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,269
that Malcolm Merlyn
is planning on leveling the Glades

153
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:18,437
using some kind
of earthquake device

154
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,189
made by Unidac
Industries.

155
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,924
Who's your source
in all this?

156
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,426
The Vigilante.

157
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:27,730
He called me.

158
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:30,333
Has been
for the last few months,

159
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,703
he's been helpful
on some cases.

160
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,822
You asked for the task
force to catch him.

161
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,573
You swore to me you'd bring him in.
I know.

162
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,659
I swore to uphold the law,
because the law is steady,

163
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,278
the law is unchanging,
the law needed to be protected.

164
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,833
But what are laws, rules,

165
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,584
if they don't protect people?

166
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,387
Now listen, I know,
I'm throwing away my career

167
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,055
by telling you this,
but I am willing to sacrifice

168
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:57,226
catching this guy
if it means saving people's lives!

169
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,512
Please.

170
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,517
You're suspended.

171
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,986
Leave the gun and your badge
with the duty sergeant.

172
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:10,106
Lieutenant...
Suspension or incarceration.

173
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,358
You choose.

174
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,995
No more lies, Mom.

175
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,298
The Undertaking.

176
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,016
We need to stop it.

177
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,719
Everything I have ever
said or done

178
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,139
has been to protect you
and your sister.

179
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:46,225
What about all those
people in the Glades?

180
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,061
I'm not their mother.

181
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:52,681
I spoke to Malcolm.
You what?!

182
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,986
He could have killed you.

183
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:02,458
He killed your father.

184
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,377
No, he didn't.

185
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,829
After the "Gambit"
went down,

186
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,766
dad and I both made it
to the life raft.

187
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:14,170
And then we drifted,
for days.

188
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,138
In the end,
there wasn't enough

189
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,375
food and water
for both of us.

190
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:23,646
So he shot himself
in the head.

191
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:26,182
I don't want to hear this.

192
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,935
He sacrificed himself...

193
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,937
So that I could live.

194
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:33,022
Do you really think

195
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,491
that I could
go on living

196
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,576
knowing that
you sacrificed

197
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:41,030
thousands more
in my name?

198
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,865
Mom.

199
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,900
Please.

200
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:47,569
You have to help me

201
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:49,338
stop Malcolm.

202
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,842
We need to know
where the device is.

203
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,856
Malcolm.

204
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,141
How can I help you?

205
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,197
I see.

206
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,817
Yes, thank you
for calling.

207
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,618
What is it?

208
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,321
Malcolm's accelerated
his timetable.

209
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:25,041
The Undertaking is...

210
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:27,660
Is happening tonight.

211
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:33,666
Where you going?

212
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:40,556
Somebody in this family
needs to put an end to this.

213
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,294
Whatever the cost.

214
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,318
Hi.

215
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,657
Hey.

216
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,043
I woke up and you were gone.

217
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm really sorry
about that.

218
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,465
Oliver, I'm trying
not to think

219
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:20,252
that our history's repeating;
That you're scared again.

220
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,321
No.

221
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,023
That's not it.

222
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:27,876
Then will you tell me what's
going on with you?

223
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,433
There are so many things

224
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,186
that I have wanted
to tell you

225
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,605
for so long.

226
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:45,327
I never told you what
happened to me on the island.

227
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,496
You didn't have to.

228
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,281
I can see that
it changed you.

229
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,700
That's the thing.

230
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,787
Laurel, it didn't.

231
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,422
Those five years
didn't change me.

232
00:15:56,424 --> 00:16:00,042
They just...
They scraped away

233
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,878
all the things that I wasn't,

234
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,514
and revealed the person
I always was,

235
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,684
which is the person...

236
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,904
That's who you always saw.

237
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:16,942
I don't know how you saw it,
but you did.

238
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:20,595
Nobody in my life
is who I thought they were...

239
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,931
Except you.

240
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:41,383
Laurel, I need you
to do something for me.

241
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:43,385
Stay out of the Glades tonight.

242
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,503
Why?

243
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,056
You'll know soon.

244
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:49,675
One way or the other.

245
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:53,429
I have to go.

246
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,741
It's over.

247
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,861
Laurel and me, I mean.

248
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,297
She's with Oliver,
again. Always.

249
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,782
I'm sorry, Son.

250
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,167
Yeah, and he said

251
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,653
you wanted to nuke
the Glades or something.

252
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,507
You know,
it's funny,

253
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,375
scotch doesn't make it
any more believable.

254
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,344
Maybe after your jihad,

255
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,963
we can grab
some steaks.

256
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,968
It's true, Tommy.

257
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,438
It's the reason
I closed your mother's clinic.

258
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,724
I didn't want
to see it leveled.

259
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,861
What?

260
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:45,447
I have something
I'd like you to listen to.

261
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,654
The night
your mother died,

262
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,540
she called me.

263
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,960
I awoke to a voicemail
from her.

264
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,361
Dad...

265
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:03,215
Her final gift to me.

266
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:07,252
Malcolm,
I'm in trouble.

267
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,422
I told--I told him
to take everything.

268
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,342
My money...my ring.

269
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,011
Turn it off.

270
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,164
They shot me.
I screamed for help,

271
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,483
but no one would come.
No one would come.

272
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:26,955
Malcolm, I don't want
to die alone.

273
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:31,193
She bled out into the pavement
while people passed,

274
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,829
did nothing.

275
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,499
Your mother
built her clinic in the Glades

276
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:40,569
because she wanted
to save this city.

277
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,172
It can't be saved.

278
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:47,142
Because the people
there don't want it to be saved.

279
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,127
So you kill them all--

280
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,846
Yes!

281
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,414
They deserve to die!

282
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,799
All of them!

283
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,069
The way she died.

284
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,644
The Undertaking
is happening tonight.

285
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,316
Oliver, Felicity
may have found something.

286
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,603
This symbol is a map of the old
subway tunnel system.

287
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,054
That's what got us
thinking the Undertaking

288
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,790
is connected to the Glades.

289
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,124
What if it's more
specific than that?

290
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,942
What do you mean?
If I had a machine

291
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,412
that could trigger
an earthquake in an otherwise

292
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:26,915
geologically stable area,
where would I position it?

293
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,951
Underground.

294
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,387
Yeah.

295
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:33,972
This is a U.S.
geological survey

296
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:36,758
of the tectonic plates
running underneath Starling City.

297
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,594
This red line here
is a known fault

298
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,629
that runs right below
the Glades.

299
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,946
About a mile, the fault
runs underneath the old

300
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,399
Tenth Street subway line.

301
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,935
Dollars to donuts, the seismic
device is somewhere along there.

302
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,737
I know where it is.

303
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,044
Now is not a good time.

304
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,579
Yeah, understate much?

305
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,981
Mom has a whole bunch
of reporters here.

306
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:03,818
She's holding a press conference
or something.

307
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,455
What channel?

308
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,173
Ah, it looks like
all of them.

309
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,326
Felicity, pull up
the local news, please.

310
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,297
My name is
Moira Dearden Queen.

311
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,767
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

312
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,888
And God forgive me,
I have failed the city.

313
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,442
For the past five years,
under the threat for my life

314
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:29,861
and the lives of my family...

315
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,615
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

316
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,768
with one horrible purpose--

317
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,824
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

318
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,577
I realize now

319
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,713
that my family's safety
will mean nothing

320
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,666
if I let this
dreadful act occur.

321
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,718
But you need to know

322
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,140
that the architect
of this nightmare...

323
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,208
is Malcolm Merlyn.

324
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,810
No!

325
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:05,013
Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens

326
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,881
in pursuit of this madness.

327
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:10,152
Adam Hunt, Frank Chen,

328
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:11,937
and my husband...

329
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,856
Robert.

330
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,446
Please.

331
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,000
If you reside in the Glades,
you need to get out now.

332
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:29,037
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

333
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
Please.

334
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:40,799
I don't understand.

335
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm sorry. I love you.

336
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,886
I love Roy.
Roy?

337
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,222
He lives
in the Glades.

338
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,808
I can't leave him there.
Sweetheart--Thea!

339
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,694
Moira Queen, you're under arrest
for conspiracy.

340
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,780
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

341
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:57,065
You have the right
to an attorney.

342
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,568
Is it true?

343
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,739
Did you kill
all those people?

344
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,907
I did what I had to do.

345
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,319
Freeze!

346
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:38,306
Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest.

347
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,313
Dad, no!

348
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,319
Please, Dad.

349
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:54,539
Stay back.

350
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,324
I don't want to hurt you.

351
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:58,110
You can't.

352
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,929
And you can't stop me.

353
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,936
Oliver, I'm sorry.

354
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,805
Don't be.

355
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,974
She gave those
people a chance.

356
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,677
I thought Merlyn
broke your bow.

357
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:20,982
I have another.

358
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,621
I was going over
the device schematics.

359
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,707
The device can be set
for a timed detonation

360
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,543
or can be remote activated
by a mobile transmitter.

361
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,994
Something Merlyn
could have on him.

362
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,162
Listen, Oliver,
if we can just

363
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,747
get our hands
on this transmitter,

364
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,082
maybe we don't need
to track down the device.

365
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:38,550
It's too big
of an "if," Diggle.

366
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,268
I need you
in the subway.

367
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,138
Find the device,
disarm it.

368
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,756
So you can take on
Merlyn by yourself?

369
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,592
I have to.

370
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,662
Oh, he'll kill you, Oliver.

371
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,931
I know.

372
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,569
He's beaten me twice.

373
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,439
And I don't know
how to stop him.

374
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,777
Ok. Well, how about this time,
you bring along something

375
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,914
you didn't have the last time
you two fought--

376
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,249
Me.
I can't let you.

377
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,034
I can't let you do this
by yourself, man.

378
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,453
Oliver, you are not alone,

379
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,305
not since
you brought me into this.

380
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:20,458
Us into this.

381
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,930
Besides, army regulations--

382
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,966
a soldier never lets
a brother go into battle alone.

383
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,142
I'm out of bows.
I got my gun.

384
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,277
I guess it's up to me
to do the dismantling.

385
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,646
This whole area
is ground zero.

386
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,365
I want you
out of here.

387
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,817
If you're not leaving,
I'm not leaving.

388
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,270
Besides, if I don't
deactivate the device,

389
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,438
who will?

390
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,800
You were right.

391
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,501
I need one more
thing from you.

392
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,837
Yeah? What do I got
left to give?

393
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,806
I know where Merlyn
is keeping the device.

394
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:11,393
It's in an abandoned subway
station near Puckett Street.

395
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:13,762
How do you know?

396
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,097
That's where
his wife was murdered.

397
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,634
I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

398
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,138
We have a mutual friend
that I think could...

399
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,824
Talk you through it.

400
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,276
She says you care
about the people of this city,

401
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,779
that it needs you.

402
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,698
Right now, Detective...

403
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,534
It needs you.

404
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,300
Earlier today, Moira Queen,
CEO of Queen Consolidated,

405
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,186
admitted to a conspiracy
to destroy the Glades.

406
00:25:57,488 --> 00:26:00,105
Everyone within a five mile
radius is asked to evacuate.

407
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,442
Please leave the area
immediately.

408
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:06,895
Evacuation centers
have been set up in Starling City.

409
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,163
Looks like we missed him.

410
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,672
Shado!

411
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,591
Slade!

412
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:34,950
Boy, I should
have figured.

413
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,485
You couldn't
save the day...

414
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:40,872
without making a mess.

415
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,124
Where's Shado?

416
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:43,875
I thought
she was with you.

417
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:45,827
Actually...

418
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,629
She's with me.

419
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,716
Let her go!
It's over, Fyers!

420
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,106
Let her go.

421
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:00,175
Amazing.

422
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:03,028
A two year operation undone

423
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,365
because a young playboy happened
to wash up on the shore,

424
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,684
and now here you are--
a killer.

425
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:14,355
You wanted
nothing more than to leave this island,

426
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:15,907
and now you can.

427
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:19,494
I can call in a rescue ship,
you can go home.

428
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,580
Tell me, Mr. Queen.

429
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:24,299
Are you prepared
to sacrifice your freedom...

430
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,751
For her?

431
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,183
Guess so.

432
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,334
Tommy.

433
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,169
Tommy. Tommy!

434
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,671
Oliver.

435
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,457
Where's your father?

436
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,709
Ohh. I don't know.

437
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,178
You were right.

438
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,248
You were right about him.

439
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,883
Oliver.

440
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,255
Are you going to kill him?

441
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,427
Get to safety.

442
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:37,605
Looks like a false wall.

443
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,134
Welcome, gentlemen.

444
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:52,220
I've been waiting for you.
I wanted to see you

445
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,055
watch your city die.

446
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,724
Where's
the transmitter?

447
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:57,476
Somewhere I can
easily get to it.

448
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:00,729
I doubt it.
You'll be too dead.

449
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:20,115
Aaah!

450
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:27,622
Stairs. Go, go.

451
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:36,882
So tell me--
are you ready to die?

452
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,385
You found it yet, Detective?

453
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,270
Not exactly sure
what I'm looking for.

454
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:45,307
Do you want me
to describe it to you?

455
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:48,176
No, I've got it.

456
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,077
You should see something
that looks like a circuit board.

457
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,730
Pull it out.
Do you see a timer?

458
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:03,950
Seven minutes.

459
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:06,586
Ok. Well, the good news is,

460
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:09,572
this is going to be
a paperweight in three.

461
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,962
What do you got there, grandpa?

462
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:19,632
Hey! Hey!

463
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,417
Hey!

464
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,269
Back off!

465
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,472
Learn how to count, jerkwad.
There's three of us.

466
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:28,090
Oh, is that right?

467
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:39,152
'Cause I only count one.

468
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,437
With a gun.

469
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:46,376
Where did you learn
how to do that?

470
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:48,327
I guess I have wicked aim.

471
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,047
What?
I went to your house.

472
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,166
Yeah, I figured I'd run for my life
with everyone else.

473
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:55,501
Did you--did you
come to rescue me?

474
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,453
Yeah.

475
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:59,505
Come on.

476
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,579
There are three wires--
you need a green one,

477
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:26,249
a yellow and one blue.

478
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,417
Cut the blue.

479
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,118
All right,
I got it, I got it.

480
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:37,827
Oh, my God.

481
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:41,597
No, no, no, no, no!

482
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,016
There must be some sort
of anti-tamper safeguard.

483
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:48,054
Hold on. I'm going to try to
figure out how to override it.

484
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,223
Not enough time.
There's not enough time!

485
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,641
Just hold on!

486
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,559
Not enough time.

487
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,947
Laurel.

488
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:00,066
Dad, don't worry,
I got your message,

489
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,852
and I did not
come into work today.

490
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:05,121
Save it, kiddo,
we both know you're there.

491
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:06,789
But listen--you got to
get out of the Glades.

492
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,158
You got to get out of
the Glades right now! Ok, please.

493
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,144
Dad?

494
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:14,330
Right now, Laurel!
Right now, Laurel!

495
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,499
Daddy,
you're scaring me.

496
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,085
Sorry, but I'm not...

497
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,921
I'm not going
to make it.

498
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:24,423
What?

499
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,725
What?!

500
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,143
You have to promise me
one thing, Laurel.

501
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:30,229
You're not going
to die along with me.

502
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,516
You have to go on
with your life.

503
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:35,217
After your sister died,
I pushed people away,

504
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:36,652
I became like a ghost.

505
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,404
I didn't think I had
the right to live

506
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:41,190
when my baby girl
didn't.

507
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:42,792
Promise me
you're not going

508
00:33:42,794 --> 00:33:45,060
to make the same
mistakes as I did.

509
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:46,496
Where are you?

510
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:49,665
Promise me, Laurel.

511
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,668
Promise me.

512
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,454
I promise.

513
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,314
I love you, honey,
now and forever.

514
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,917
I love you.

515
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,521
Dad!

516
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:14,273
Detective Lance?

517
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:18,361
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

518
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,898
You do know how dangerous

519
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,866
it is to text and drive,
right? It can wait!

520
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,568
No, it can't. I'm trying to find us
another route out of here.

521
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,704
Let me. It's not
worth the risk.

522
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,957
Roy!

523
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,327
Roy!

524
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,779
Help me out! Help me out!
Help me out!

525
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,664
Roy, stop! Roy!

526
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:42,168
The device is about
to go off any second!

527
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,055
I can't leave
anyone behind.

528
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:48,457
I know you think
you have something to prove.

529
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,561
But you're not the Vigilante!

530
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:54,981
I can't do this
unless I know you're safe.

531
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:58,401
Then you better
haul ass out of it.

532
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:40,860
Don't struggle.
It's over.

533
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:43,195
There was never any
doubt in the outcome.

534
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:47,233
Don't worry. Your mother
and sister will be joining you in death.

535
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,318
Survive.

536
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:08,321
Thank you
for teaching me

537
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:11,707
what I'm fighting for.

538
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:16,211
But my father taught me how.

539
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,490
Come on!

540
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,453
Oliver,
Lance did it.

541
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:43,339
It's over.

542
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,875
If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman,

543
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:49,345
it's...

544
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,964
Redundancy.

545
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,093
Felicity...

546
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:07,096
there's another device.

547
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:10,649
There's two of them!

548
00:37:17,657 --> 00:37:19,608
What the hell's
happening?!

549
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:25,280
Ok, that's enough.

550
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,335
Ohh!

551
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,681
I turned
the damn thing off!

552
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:56,384
Merlyn had a second device!

553
00:37:56,386 --> 00:38:00,922
My daughter! Laurel!
She's at CNRI!

554
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:04,359
Run!

555
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,213
Laurel!

556
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,832
Oliver?

557
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,384
Are you ok?

558
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,720
Yeah.

559
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:37,792
The damage seems
to be contained

560
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:40,729
on the east side,

561
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:42,364
past Wells Street.

562
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:44,015
Laurel.

563
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,101
Are you going
to be ok?

564
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:48,937
Go, go, go.

565
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,076
Help!

566
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:04,252
Please! Help me!

567
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:07,422
Tommy!

568
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,758
What are you doing here?

569
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,377
I kind of figured that you might
come back to CNRI.

570
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,765
You came here for me?

571
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:21,303
I love you.

572
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,179
Get up! Go!

573
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,982
I'm right behind you!

574
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,701
Laurel! Laurel!

575
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:39,687
Dad! Dad!
Oh, thank God.

576
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,076
No!

577
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:47,996
No! Laurel!
No, you can't!

578
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,965
Tommy!
You can't!

579
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:55,971
It's too late,
it's too late.

580
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,345
Tommy!

581
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:15,774
Ah, Tommy.

582
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,860
You're going to be fine.

583
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:22,730
Another thing...
We got to disagree on.

584
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,906
Tommy...

585
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:34,259
Is--is Laurel safe?

586
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,711
Is Laurel safe?
I tried to get her out of here.

587
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:39,965
Yeah, yeah, you did.

588
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,434
You saved her.

589
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:45,053
I'm going to get you
out of here.

590
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,554
You're going to be fine.

591
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:48,589
Stop.

592
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:55,563
I'm sorry.

593
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,532
No. Don't apologize.

594
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,484
I was angry.

595
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:03,538
And I was jealous. I--

596
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,875
I am my father.

597
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:08,776
No.

598
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:10,245
No, you're not.

599
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:14,062
Did--did you kill him?

600
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,634
No.

601
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:23,006
Thank you.

602
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,377
No, no!

603
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,765
Tommy!

604
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:38,388
It should have been me.

605
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,891
Open your eyes, Tommy!

606
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:50,066
Open your eyes.

Run, run!

4
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,329
No, no, no, no, no!

5
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,402
Oh, come on, man!
I'm just trying

6
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,937
to make
an honest living!

7
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,772
There's nothing honest
about what you do!

8
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,824
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

9
00:00:57,826 --> 00:00:59,676
Tell me now and you live.

10
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,828
Please!
They'll kill me!

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,564
Whoever you fear...

12
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,366
Fear me more!

13
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,168
Okay, okay!

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,871
We call him The Count,
that's all I know.

15
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,207
I swear to God!

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,545
Hey!

17
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,580
Get me down
from here!

18
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,549
Find what you're looking for?

19
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:25,051
Took down three Vertigo
pushers tonight, Diggle.

20
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,419
Last one finally knew a name.

21
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,054
The Count.

22
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,373
The Count?
That's worse than The Hood.

23
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,225
You're not going
back out there.

24
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:34,194
I'm not done
for the night.

25
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,479
Whoever this Count is,
he has a lot of blood on his hands,

26
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,148
and it is long past time
he started paying.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,700
Well, slow down, I think
you're missing the point here.

28
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,435
What?

29
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,904
Thea.

30
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,706
Her hearing's
in a few hours.

31
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,641
You think she cares more
about some drug lord

32
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,276
getting his
just desserts,

33
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,358
or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

34
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,969
Hey, we should
get going.

35
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,821
Judges don't
appreciate the value

36
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,339
in being
fashionably late.

37
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:06,363
Got any other tips?

38
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,397
Let the lawyer
do all the talking.

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,982
They'll give you
a pad and paper

40
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,234
but do not play
tic tac toe.

41
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,454
Judges don't
appreciate that, either.

42
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,625
Come on, Speedy.

43
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,126
I know, I know.

44
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:24,830
Keep on trying
to get up and go,

45
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,365
but...

46
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,300
just don't.

47
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:31,203
I wish dad were here.

48
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,873
I'm here.

49
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,927
We should leave now, Thea.

50
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:41,313
Ms. Queen.

51
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,432
Thea, over here.
Can we get a comment?

52
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,933
Just one comment!

53
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,903
Thea, are you
going into rehab?

54
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,357
Miss Queen, are you being
dispelled from Balliol Prep?

55
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,076
Are you worried
about the outcome?

56
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,029
Docket ending 1-10-5-6,
People vs. Thea Dearden Queen.

57
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,614
Possession
of a controlled substance,

58
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,283
driving under the influence
of a controlled substance.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,306
Counselors, I understand
you've reached a plea agreement.

60
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,375
We have, Your Honor.

61
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,959
Given that my client
is a juvenile,

62
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,961
the people have generously
agreed to probation.

63
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:15,180
Juvenile?

64
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:17,016
Says right here she's 18.

65
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:18,634
She is 18 now,
Your Honor,

66
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,085
but at the time of arrest,
she was still two days shy

67
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,970
of her 18th birthday.

68
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,222
Ms. Queen
has no priors.

69
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,606
Well, just because
Ms. Queen's family

70
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,725
sweeps her priors
under the rug,

71
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,060
doesn't mean they don't exist.

72
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,529
You get your client off,

73
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,731
and you help your boss
avoid dealing with the drug

74
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,651
that's sweeping across
our city like the plague.

75
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,486
Everyone wins, except us,

76
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,954
the people of Starling City.

77
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,222
Your Honor,
with all due respect--

78
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,291
Ms. Queen,
like it or not,

79
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:45,127
you are now the poster child
for this menace.

80
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,529
Maybe if people see
that the Queen family

81
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,798
can't get away
with using Vertigo,

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,668
they'll think twice
before using it themselves.

83
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,236
The plea arrangement
is denied.

84
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,424
This case will
proceed to trial.

85
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:07,516
They can't do this.

86
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,102
That man cannot send
my daughter to prison.

87
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:11,937
What are our options?

88
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,572
An interlocutory appeal.

89
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:17,142
But trial judges have discretion
to reject plea agreements.

90
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,578
I think you might want to
prepare yourself for the possibility

91
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,281
that this isn't going
to go our way.

92
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

93
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,919
I'll get to work
on the appeal.

94
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:31,957
Well, so much for the best
criminal defense attorney in the city.

95
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:37,096
Thea, we will handle this,
I promise.

96
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,265
Like you promised Walter
you'd always stay faithful to him?

97
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,351
I feel better already.
That's enough!

98
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,853
Don't worry.
Sounds like you won't

99
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:47,773
have to be putting up
with me much longer.

100
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,178
What, does she not realize
how serious this is?

101
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,482
She took drugs.

102
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,650
She drove. She could have
killed someone, or herself.

103
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:01,153
I know.
All that judge is looking for

104
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,739
is someone to make
an example of.

105
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:06,408
What does it have to be her?

106
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,977
Maybe it doesn't.

107
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,165
Listen, I have to go
do something.

108
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,634
Are you going
to be okay?

109
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,471
I'm not the one facing prison.

110
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:39,107
You working
for them now?

111
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,326
Why are you
doing this to me?

112
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:43,946
I thought
we were friends.

113
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,732
Or...something.

114
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:51,670
I mean, why'd you bother
keeping me safe

115
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:53,789
if you were just going
to hand me over to them?

116
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,881
Just get me out of here.

117
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,686
I can't.

118
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,189
Hey! Don't leave me here!

119
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,140
I came back for you!

120
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,643
Do you hear me?

121
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,396
I came back for you!

124
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,996
Hi. Looking
for Detective Hall.

125
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,745
I was told
he works in Vice.

126
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:36,081
Oliver?

127
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,383
McKenna Hall.

128
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,801
Hi.

129
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,720
Here I was,
expecting a middle aged guy

130
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:43,121
in a bad suit...

131
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,257
And I got McKenna Hall.

132
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,125
I live to surprise.

133
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,677
Well, I remember.

134
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,178
What was that club
that you got us kicked out of?

135
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,647
The Club Deville?
Okay, in my defense,

136
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,515
there was no sign
that specifically said

137
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,234
you had to keep
your clothes on.

138
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,269
So, a cop?

139
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,804
I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

140
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:02,024
I still go to raves.

141
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,992
I just go
undercover now.

142
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,661
And I have to dress
slightly more appropriately

143
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,747
to hide my badge and gun.
Right.

144
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,933
So what do you need
with a vice cop, Oliver?

145
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,418
Vertigo.

146
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,456
Right. I saw your sister on TV.
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,790
The judge is trying
to make an example of her.

148
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,175
So I was thinking,

149
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,710
if you could find the person
selling the drugs,

150
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,962
it make take some
of the heat off Thea.

151
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:26,298
Easier said than done.

152
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,334
Did some digging
and came up with a name.

153
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,553
Um, The Count?

154
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,974
Oliver, we've known
about The Count for months.

155
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,109
Oh.

156
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,894
I wish this
was thicker,

157
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,646
but we really don't
have much on him.

158
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,731
Love to say we're
going to catch him

159
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,317
before your sister's
trial, but it's highly unlikely.

160
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,786
Oh, I am late
for my shift.

161
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,122
Well, if you hear
of anything about this guy,

162
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,125
just...let me know?

163
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,462
I always loved how much you cared
about your sister.

164
00:07:57,464 --> 00:08:01,083
But leave the policing
to the police, okay?

165
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,918
Okay.

166
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:14,479
What did Queen want?

167
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:17,015
He's an old friend,
sister's jammed up.

168
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,518
Anything else,
Sergeant?

169
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,219
No.

170
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:41,123
You need a tailor.

171
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,457
You know about
the hood guy.

172
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:43,742
He just
cornered me, man.

173
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,093
The hood guy?

174
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,412
I didn't
say anything.

175
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,548
Oh, I know.

176
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,150
You can't divulge secrets
you don't know.

177
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,138
But...

178
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,557
examples must be made.

179
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:04,029
Vertigo,

180
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:07,449
in its purest form.

181
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,484
When injected directly
into the bloodstream,

182
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,903
it affects the thalamus
region of your brain.

183
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,789
Which is where all
of the information

184
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,957
from your pain receptors
is collected.

185
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,943
No doubt you're in
excruciating pain.

186
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:21,112
But actually, you're not.

187
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,615
You just think you are.

188
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,300
I've seen it last for days,

189
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:28,336
until finally
the heart gives out.

190
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,678
One bullet left.

191
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:43,101
Now, you can use
that bullet to shoot me

192
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,820
and take your revenge,

193
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,939
or...you could
shoot yourself.

194
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,975
It's your choice.

195
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,963
The Hood.

196
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,566
Coming for me.

197
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,971
Interesting.

198
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,652
I'm learning you're not much
of a morning snuggler.

199
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,299
And I'm learning that
you don't like to wake up

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,983
at any hour
that ends in a.m.

201
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,285
That's true. Yeah.

202
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,086
So if you're busy
being a lawyer all day

203
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,506
and I'm managing
a night club all night,

204
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,641
when exactly do we get
to see each other?

205
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,376
Hmm.

206
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,812
I got it. Stay.

207
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,551
Hey.

208
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:11,936
Hey.

209
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,689
Hey, how--
how is Thea holding up?

210
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,058
She's doing okay.
Thank you.

211
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,693
Um...Actually, I--

212
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,696
I came to talk
to Laurel.

213
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,031
Yeah.

214
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,584
Hi.
Hi.

215
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,119
Thank you for coming
to court yesterday.

216
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,421
Yeah, of course.

217
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,905
But I don't think
the judge is willing

218
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,124
to move off his position.
Taking a hard line

219
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,261
against criminals is
a platform for his reelection.

220
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,463
I need you to talk
to your father.

221
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,633
He's inside the system,
and...maybe he cashes in

222
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,302
a chip with Judge Brackett,
gets him off throwing the book at Thea.

223
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,688
Oliver, I don't--

224
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,257
Laurel, I am working
on something on my end,

225
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,476
but...

226
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,278
If it doesn't work out,

227
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,764
this is my best chance
to help my sister.

228
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,434
Please.

229
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,437
I'll see
what I can do.

230
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,939
But no promises.

231
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,192
Thank you.

232
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,945
Yeah.

233
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,505
Absolutely not.

234
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,257
Dad, I know
how you feel about Oliver.

235
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,426
Then why would you even
ask me to do this.

236
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,344
Because Thea,
she's only 18 years old.

237
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,980
Which makes her an adult.
She can take her medicine.

238
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,266
It's about time someone
in the Queen family did.

239
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,767
What about
the Lance family?

240
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,903
A young girl
acting out,

241
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,521
engaging
in reckless behavior,

242
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,740
does that sound
familiar?

243
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,609
Laurel,
don't go there.

244
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,328
Thea, she's just like
I remember Sarah.

245
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,497
That is not how
I remember your sister.

246
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,165
That's because
you remember her

247
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,533
the way that you
wish she had been,

248
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,785
not the way that
she actually was.

249
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,588
She's not the Saint that
you make her out to be.

250
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,374
I know she was arrested
for shoplifting

251
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,376
and I know
you made it go away.

252
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,512
Well, maybe
if I let her go to jail,

253
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,214
Queen wouldn't have had her
on that damn boat.

254
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,051
Dad, you make it sound
like he kidnapped her.

255
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,835
For so long,

256
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,972
you and I have blamed Oliver
for Sarah's death,

257
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,974
but Sarah's
to blame, too.

258
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,293
When I look at Thea,

259
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,646
I see Sarah's
potential in her.

260
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,230
And her flaws, too.

261
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,651
Yes, Thea made
a mistake.

262
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,036
But she's been
through a lot.

263
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,456
She lost a father
and a brother.

264
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,659
She doesn't need prison.

265
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,461
She needs help.

266
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,630
So please...

267
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:45,806
I'll make some calls.

268
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,400
I've seen a fair amount
of Cyrillic back in Afghanistan

269
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,152
left over
by the Soviets.

270
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,154
Is this Russian owned?

271
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,655
This is the not
so hidden headquarters

272
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,657
for the Starling City
chapter of the Bratva.

273
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,226
Diggle...

274
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,112
Whatever I say,

275
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,731
whatever goes down,

276
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,450
just go with it.

277
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,452
Zdravstvuyte.

278
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,621
Good to see you.

279
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,506
Long time.

280
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,292
Particularly
for Bratva captain.

281
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,411
I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

282
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,464
I decided on pharmaceuticals.

283
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,351
I don't mean aspirin.

284
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,419
A wise choice.

285
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,973
Mepheodrone would be a good
investment for you.

286
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,592
It's the newest thing.

287
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,861
I was thinking Vertigo.

288
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,596
Newer thing.

289
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,481
Tough market, Vertigo.

290
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,700
Only one seller.
I know.

291
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,535
I was hoping you could
do me a favor

292
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,055
and arrange a meeting.

293
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,906
He's difficult man.

294
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:56,994
And he does not
like new friends.

295
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,999
This is everything
the police have on him.

296
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,785
Tell him it's a gift.

297
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:12,142
I will see
what I can do.

298
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,396
Provided you do
favor for me.

299
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,297
Vse chto ugodno.

300
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,519
It is unusual
for an American

301
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,855
to hold such
a position of esteem

302
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,242
in our organization.

303
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,028
Mr. Queen.

304
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,280
Anatoli Knyazev.

305
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,249
He speaks
very highly of you.

306
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,419
He should.
I saved his life.

307
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,257
What did he do?

308
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,259
Something
I told him not to.

309
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,461
Now the favor.

310
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,863
Kill this man for me,

311
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,516
and I will believe
your interest

312
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,052
in our organization
is genuine.

313
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,773
And then I will arrange a meeting
with The Count.

314
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,598
Oliver...
Hey, shut up!

315
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,036
What are friends for?

316
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,424
I'm out of the gates
now. What's going on?

317
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,145
Are we getting
out of here?

318
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,813
Where are you taking me?

319
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,434
While I admit that bout
was particularly one-sided,

320
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,086
would anybody else
like to give it a try?

321
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:26,393
The point of these little
gladiatorial distractions

322
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:29,980
is to strengthen
unit cohesion.

323
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,282
To that end, I think

324
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,318
our newest recruit
ought to be afforded

325
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,104
the opportunity
to try his hand.

326
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,836
I can't believe
you just killed that guy.

327
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,340
You really have
a low opinion of me.

328
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,750
Whoa! That's a neat trick.

329
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:11,219
You going to teach me
that one day?

330
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,524
No.

331
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,577
What are you doing?

332
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,362
You need to arrange
a new identity for this guy.

333
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,529
Get him out of the city.

334
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,415
Right, so your Ruskie pal

335
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,450
draws out The Count,
vigilante takes him down.

336
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,369
No, Diggle,
because then the Bratva

337
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,371
would know that I used them,
and that relationship is too valuable.

338
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,339
I do the meet
with The Count as myself,

339
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,210
let him leave, then we follow him
to his hideout.

340
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,711
Just that easy, huh?

341
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,664
Well, I will still need
my trust bodyguard.

342
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,634
Fantastic. Looking forward
to my new and exciting career

343
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:44,170
as a drug dealer.

344
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,807
He's a captain.

345
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,509
And he has money.

346
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,945
Are you interested?

347
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,780
Hmm.

348
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,933
Let's say...yes.

349
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,227
My father was able
to get Judge Brackett

350
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,712
to back off
his hardline stance.

351
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,064
Your father hates me.

352
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,432
No.
No.

353
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:11,768
My father hates him.

354
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,822
Look, nobody asked you
to get involved.

355
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,157
I did.

356
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,159
The judge has agreed
to a sentence

357
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,862
of 500 hours
of community service

358
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,063
and two years of probation.

359
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,900
Provisional on the appointment
of someone to act in loco parentis.

360
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,135
In loco what?

361
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,620
It means that
the court will appoint

362
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:34,174
an individual to assume
responsibility for you.

363
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,427
Me.

364
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,045
I say thanks,
but no thanks.

365
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,847
Thea!

366
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,182
You don't actually
have a choice.

367
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:44,768
Oh, actually, I do.

368
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,355
See, I'm 18 now and I can make
my own decisions.

369
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:53,827
So I decide not to be
your ex-girlfriend's office monkey.

370
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,564
Well, if you change
your mind, then.

371
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,539
Thank you.

372
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,490
Yeah.

373
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,661
Thea...

374
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:15,332
You're in real trouble,
and rightly so.

375
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,384
Doing drugs
and driving?

376
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:20,170
It is beyond stupid. That is
a good deal that Laurel got you.

377
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,254
Why aren't you
jumping at it?

378
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,673
I already have a mother.

379
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,225
So...

380
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,726
you're going
to go to jail

381
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,012
and it will ruin
the rest of your life.

382
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,630
No.

383
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,066
I want to ruin mom's life.

384
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,986
She's a liar and a cheat.

385
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,271
I mean, deal with, Ollie.
You can pretend

386
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:40,240
all you want to
that she's a saint,

387
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,909
but I hate her.
And she betrayed dad.

388
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,946
So you're just--you're going
to go to jail to spite her?

389
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,649
Thea...

390
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,037
Mom didn't cheat on dad.

391
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,506
He cheated on her.

392
00:20:56,508 --> 00:21:00,060
Is that the best
you can come up with?

393
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:05,048
Dad wasn't the man
he said he was.

394
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,951
On "The Queen's Gambit"
right before he died,

395
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:11,488
he admitted to me
that he failed us.

396
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,739
You.

397
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:16,543
Me. And mom.

398
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:20,130
That he wasn't the man
he said he was

399
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,349
and that he just wished...

400
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,088
he wished he had more time
to right his wrongs.

401
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,290
I don't believe you.

402
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,425
Yes, you do.

403
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:36,296
Leave me alone.

404
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:42,952
How dare you.

405
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:46,539
She was old enough
to know the truth.

406
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,516
Oliver, the Russians called.

407
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,885
The meet is set.

408
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:02,522
It's tonight.

409
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,696
You know why
they call him The Count?

410
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,499
When he was
developing this drug,

411
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,400
he experimented
on the homeless.

412
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:17,370
Prostitutes, runaways.

413
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,039
The police
would find their bodies,

414
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,291
puncture marks
on their neck,

415
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,876
like a vampire.

416
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:31,017
You should not be in such a hurry
to meet this man.

417
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,280
Thank you for this.

418
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:46,483
But I'm not
overly concerned

419
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,734
about the SCPD.

420
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:50,286
Now, I understand
you gentlemen

421
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:53,156
wish to participate in
the feel good business.

422
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:56,409
Yes.
And why is that?

423
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,877
Well, I am opening
a nightclub,

424
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,947
and I'd like my customers
to have a little...

425
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,049
something extra.

426
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,552
Well, as it happens,

427
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,555
I'm looking
to expand my brand.

428
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:15,995
A good wine's value is measured
by its vintage.

429
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,765
The number of years
it took to ferment.

430
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:23,186
Vertigo is measured
in lives.

431
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,808
56 people died

432
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,077
to perfect this high.

433
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,280
Believe me when I say
that they did not

434
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:38,317
die for nothing.

435
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,014
The cops!

436
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,098
We've been set up!
Let's get out!

437
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,768
Go! Go!

438
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,638
SCPD! Put your weapons down!

439
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,011
Down!

440
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,650
Oliver!

441
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:13,236
Hey!

442
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:19,409
No witnesses.

443
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,014
Get out of the car!

444
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,218
Keep it.
Yeah, we got to go.

445
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,337
Steps. Let's go.

446
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:12,573
Oliver!

447
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:18,612
Drink.

448
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,470
Wait!

449
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,072
Mornin'.

450
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:14,968
How you feeling?

451
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,754
I feel like
I'm getting

452
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:20,090
the worst hangover
of my life.

453
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,542
That coming from a guy who spent
most of his twenties in a hangover,

454
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:24,845
that's really saying something.

455
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,932
You think
you can uncuff me?

456
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,984
Not going to kill you.

457
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:33,387
Promise.

458
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,527
Ahh.

459
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,867
You're standing.

460
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,735
That's pretty impressive.

461
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:53,340
The Count only got you
with half a dose,

462
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,076
but you still sweated out
a small swimming pool coming down.

463
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,263
The Count.

464
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:02,433
Any chance our friends
in SCPD took him down?

465
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,752
None at all, but we did
manage to get this.

466
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,472
Think we should analyze it.

467
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,592
Listen, Oliver, maybe you need
to give it a few hours.

468
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:14,994
A near drug overdose isn't something
you just walk away from.

469
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:21,435
Neither is Thea.

470
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:28,709
What's wrong?

471
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,128
Is everything
okay with Thea?

472
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,046
This isn't about your sister,
this is about you.

473
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:36,300
Last night we got a call
from a C.I.,

474
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:39,503
busted up a drug sale between
a big time dealer and the Russian mob.

475
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:42,506
"We"? I thought
you worked Vice.

476
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,409
Joint task force. Vertigo's
got everybody holding hands.

477
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,377
Like I said...

478
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,932
Last night,
drug deal gone south.

479
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,501
An eyewitness
put you at the scene.

480
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:57,237
Whoever he is,
he's mistaken.

481
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,222
Yeah?

482
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,441
I saw you, Oliver.

483
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:05,929
Is this true?

484
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:09,116
I was checking
into The Count.

485
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,751
He's the guy who
sold drugs to Thea.

486
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:13,086
And I figured if I could find out
what he looked like,

487
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,289
then I could give your sketch artist
something to go on.

488
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,925
So I paid a low-life
with a Russian accent

489
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,877
an obscene amount
of money to arrange a meeting.

490
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:21,211
And? Did you get eyes on him?

491
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,696
No.

492
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:26,500
All right, are you pressing charges
against my son?

493
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,304
You get involved
in this again,

494
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,939
you'll see the inside
of a cell,

495
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,724
and unlike last time,
you will not see the way out.

496
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,108
Detective.

497
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,144
Thank you very much.

498
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,532
Thank you for what
you did for Thea.

499
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:44,568
My daughter asked me
for a favor and I did it.

500
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,187
And that's the end of it.

501
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:55,862
Hope you don't think
I sold you out.

502
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:59,199
No. Just doing your job.

503
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:04,755
What on earth
were you thinking?

504
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,089
I was trying to help.

505
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,391
By running around
with the Russian mob

506
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:09,176
and a murderous
drug dealer?

507
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:10,811
Are you out
of your mind?!

508
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:12,896
Mom, look,

509
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:14,481
the real reason
that you're upset

510
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:17,518
is because I told Thea
the truth about dad.

511
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,436
She never needed
to know that.

512
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:22,105
Yes, I did.

513
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,526
I'm old enough
to know the truth, Mom.

514
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:31,782
It wasn't about
your age.

515
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:38,705
It was about preserving
your memory of your father.

516
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,707
He loved you.

517
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:44,411
No matter his faults,
he loved you.

518
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:47,881
I said that I wished

519
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,217
you had died
instead of him,

520
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,920
but...you still
didn't say anything.

521
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,722
Why?

522
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,693
One day,

523
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:03,196
I hope you're lucky enough
to have a daughter,

524
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:06,516
and you'll know why.

525
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:11,438
I'm so sorry for what I said.

526
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,908
I know, I know.

527
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,920
Now what?

528
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:28,622
Like you said,
we analyze the Vertigo.

529
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,641
It's in liquid form,
which means it contains water.

530
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,293
So maybe we can
trace back to where

531
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:34,612
in the city The Count is...

532
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,299
cooking up this garbage.

533
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:42,423
Hey, we need
to get you to a hospital.

534
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,475
No.

535
00:31:44,477 --> 00:31:46,177
Oliver, God knows
what was in that drug.

536
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,762
It could be causing
permanent damage.

537
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:49,180
Felicity.

538
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:52,316
Hey, they said
you'd be up here.

539
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,652
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

540
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,771
Not that there are cats
in this building.

541
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,608
Well, once a cat did get in,
but a guard tazed it.

542
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,278
It smelled like fur and static
in here for like a week.

543
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,063
Ahem.

544
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:07,782
Would you mind stepping
away from the window for a moment?

545
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:10,401
I have a little bit
of a hangover.

546
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,453
Sounds like you need
a bloody Mary and a pretzel,

547
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,572
not the I.T.
Department.

548
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:16,174
Actually, my buddy Kevin

549
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,708
is starting
an energy drink company.

550
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,645
He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers,

551
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,763
but I am very particular

552
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,131
about what it is
I put in my body.

553
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,250
I've noticed.

554
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:28,219
I said, not noticed.

555
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:29,253
Right?

556
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,024
I'm trying to find
a secret recipe.

557
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,609
Could you please
do a spectroanalysis

558
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,394
of the sample
and find out exactly

559
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:39,197
where in the city it's made?

560
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:42,066
If it's an energy drink,

561
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,918
why is it
in a syringe?

562
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,321
I ran out of sports bottles.

563
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,911
Okay.

564
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:59,950
Your B.S. stories
are getting worse.

565
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:03,137
I'm well aware.

566
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,139
Looks like Felicity
came through.

567
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:07,225
The solvent used
in the Vertigo sample

568
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,894
was run off water originated
within a ten block radius

569
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:13,848
of where East Glades
meets the bay.

570
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,933
Nothing there except
for an old juvenile detention center

571
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:18,069
abandoned about three years ago.

572
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,937
Cutbacks.

573
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:24,242
You can't go out there,
though, Oliver.

574
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,777
You're still suffering
the after-affects of the Vertigo.

575
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:27,995
Did you hear The Count?

576
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:30,164
He's taking
this drug citywide.

577
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,483
If we don't stop him now,
this becomes an epidemic.

578
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:34,318
I can stop you from leaving.

579
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,624
Try.

580
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:48,165
Oliver, you hit this
and you can leave.

581
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:15,576
I'm glad you came
to your senses.

582
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:18,462
You should always
remember one thing, Dig.

583
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:19,580
What's that?

584
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:22,032
I don't need the bow.

585
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,521
My C.I. swears
this is the place.

586
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:19,724
Bring your men
up on the flank.

587
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,559
Okay, this way.
Follow me.

588
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:24,895
He's here!
He who?

589
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:27,198
The Hood!

590
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,132
Looks like we're not
the only guests.

591
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:48,419
You should have stuck
to your depraved elite.

592
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:52,056
I am merely providing people
with what they want.

593
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:54,425
I am providing
a public service!

594
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,927
So am I.

595
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:10,741
Enjoy the fruits
of your labor.

596
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:16,447
Freeze! Put down the needle!

597
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,699
Or I will shoot you!

598
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:28,443
Put down the syringe.

599
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:31,598
He deserves this!
Not according to the law.

600
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,768
The people that think
you're a hero,

601
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:35,470
people like my daughter,
if they could see you now...

602
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:36,771
You're no hero.

603
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,024
You're what I always
said you were--

604
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,694
a killer.

605
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:46,865
Get him!

606
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:55,540
Get me an ambulance. Now!

607
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:03,281
Juvenile delinquent
reporting for duty.

608
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,949
Since you lost
your driver's license,

609
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,985
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
6:00.

610
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:08,670
We have a lot of work
for her to do.

611
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:11,222
Well, then, let's say
7:00 just to be safe.

612
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,974
Is it too late
to choose jail?

613
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,309
Yes.
Yes.

614
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,928
I need you to go
through these files

615
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,647
and pull out all the documents
dated March 2007.

616
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:21,883
Do you think
you could do that?

617
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:24,135
I think I can.

618
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:27,906
I know I messed up.

619
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:31,659
I really appreciate
this, Laurel.

620
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:33,411
We are going to make
an upstanding citizen

621
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,646
out of you yet, speedy.

622
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,834
Thank you.
And this will be good for her,

623
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:41,753
having a role model,
somebody better than me.

624
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,671
Oh, you're not so bad.

625
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,490
And besides, it'll be nice
to have her around.

626
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:52,096
I got to take this.
Excuse me.

627
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:53,431
Hello?

628
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,266
We got The Count.

629
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,051
Bust up his lab,
got him on everything

630
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:59,187
from drug trafficking
to homicide.

631
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,339
He'll be gone
for a long while.

632
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:03,308
That's great, thanks.

633
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,010
It was great
seeing you, Oliver.

634
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,646
You, too.

635
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:10,615
See ya.

636
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:16,788
He's still critical.

637
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,122
I've never seen
anyone OD

638
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:20,241
on this much Vertigo
and live.

639
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,743
There's just
no way of knowing

640
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,494
what kind of damage
has been done to his brain

641
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:24,796
and nervous system.

642
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:26,197
Or if its irreparable.

643
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,737
Shengeun...

644
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,440
Survive.

645
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,512
Hi.
Hi.

646
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,631
Thanks for meeting me.
I was...nervous

647
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,016
to come to your house.

648
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:10,684
Okay...

649
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,653
The thing is,

650
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,405
I've been debating
whether or not

651
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:16,857
to share this
with you for weeks.

652
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,443
Can I trust you?

653
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:21,946
I'm not an idiot.

654
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:25,249
You've dropped some fairly
ridiculous lies on me,

655
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:29,453
and...yet I still feel
like I can trust you.

656
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:34,208
Why is that?

657
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,793
I have one
of those faces.

658
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:39,547
Sorry.

659
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:42,116
Yes.

660
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:45,452
You can trust me.

661
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,339
Then I have something
to show you.

662
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:13,664
Have you ever
seen this before?

663
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,532
No.

664
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,587
Where'd you get it?

665
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:22,473
From your stepfather.

666
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,845
From Walter.

667
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,680
Um...

668
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:32,650
Well, where did
he get it?

669
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:38,022
He said he found it
in your house.

670
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:40,991
That it belongs to your mother.

671
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:45,446
Walter thought
she was hiding something.

672
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:49,850
Something more, and...

673
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:53,337
He wanted me to look into it,
but then he vanished.

674
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:57,875
I think this list might have cost
Walter his life.

2
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,574
The name
of the island they found me on

3
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,276
is Lian Yu.

4
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:06,696
It's mandarin for "purgatory."

5
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:10,700
I've been stranded here for
5 years.

6
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:14,537
I've dreamt of my rescue every
cold black night since then.

7
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:19,375
For 5 years, I have had
only one thought, one goal...

8
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,294
survive...

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,798
Survive and one day return home.

10
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,020
The island held many dangers.

11
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:34,106
To live, I had to make myself
more than what I was,

12
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,776
to forge myself into a weapon.

13
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:39,779
I am returning not the boy who
was shipwrecked

14
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,781
but the man who will bring
justice to those

15
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:43,866
who have poisoned my city.

16
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,120
My name is Oliver Queen.

17
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,795
Oliver Queen is alive.

18
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:58,664
The Starling City resident
was found by fishermen

19
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,033
in the North China sea
5 days ago,

20
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,586
5 years after he was missing
and presumed dead

21
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,054
following the accident at sea

22
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,872
which claimed
"The Queen's Gambit."

23
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,374
Queen was a regular
tabloid presence

24
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,226
and a fixture at
the Starling City club scene.

25
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:11,727
Shortly before
his disappearance,

26
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,562
he was acquitted of assault
charges stemming

27
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:15,431
from a highly publicized
drunken altercation

28
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,983
with paparazzi.

29
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:20,269
Queen is the son of Starling
City billionaire Robert Queen,

30
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:23,105
who was also on board but
now officially confirmed

31
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,740
as deceased.

32
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,113
20% of his body
is covered

33
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:32,615
in scar tissue.

34
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,083
Second-degree burns

35
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,618
on his back
and arms.

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,119
X-rays show at least
12 fractures

37
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:39,405
that never
properly healed.

38
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:42,425
Has he said anything
about what happened?

39
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,927
No. He's barely
said anything.

40
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:49,015
Moira, I'd like
you to prepare yourself.

41
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,651
The Oliver you lost
might not be

42
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,302
the one they found.

43
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,333
Oliver.

44
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,626
Mom.

45
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,620
Oh...

46
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,474
My beautiful boy.

47
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,412
I've got it.

48
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:56,815
Your room is exactly
as you left it.

49
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,784
I never had the heart
to change a thing.

50
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,152
Oliver.

51
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,922
It's damn good
to see you.

52
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,259
It's Walter...

53
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,544
Walter Steele.

54
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:10,596
You remember Walter,
your father's friend

55
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,381
from the company.

56
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:19,105
It's good to see
you, Raisa.

57
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,891
Welcome home, Mr. Oliver.

58
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,527
Mr. Merlyn phoned. He wants
to join you for dinner.

59
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,694
Wonderful.

60
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,448
Oliver?

61
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,117
Did you hear that?

62
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,905
Hey, sis.

63
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,045
I knew it.
I knew you were alive.

64
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,999
I missed you so much.

65
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,386
You were with me
the whole time.

66
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,925
Come on, Laurel. We're
lawyers, not miracle workers.

67
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:57,376
We can't win this.

68
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,811
If we can't win
a class-action suit

69
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,229
against a man who
swindled

70
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,647
hundreds of people out
of their homes

71
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,848
and life savings,

72
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,216
then we're not fit
to call ourselves

73
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:05,384
a legal aid office.

74
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:06,852
And if we
go bankrupt

75
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:07,987
in the process,

76
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,321
we won't be
a legal aid office.

77
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,739
Hunt has an army of
lawyers, and they're

78
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,074
ready to bury us.

79
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,393
You and I against an army.
I love those odds.

80
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,412
Why do you
hate me?

81
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,420
And in other news,

82
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,021
details
as to the castaway story

83
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,739
you've all heard about...

84
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,074
the son of a very
wealthy billionaire

85
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,344
will soon become
a legendary story.

86
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,579
Jessica now
has more details

87
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,047
and the complete
castaway story.

88
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,048
"The Queen's Gambit" was

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,100
last heard from more
than 5 years ago.

90
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,636
Mr. Queen
has reportedly confirmed

91
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:43,105
he was the only survivor
of the accident

92
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,391
that took the lives of
7 people, including

93
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,726
local resident Sarah Lance.

94
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,362
Survived by her sister,
Laurel...

95
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,205
After 5 years,

96
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,442
everything that was once
familiar is now unrecognizable.

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,334
The face I see in the mirror

98
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,620
is a stranger.

99
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,242
The storm's
a category 2.

100
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:37,660
The captain's
recommending

101
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,995
we head back.

102
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,330
All right.
Inform the crew.

103
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,531
Are we in trouble?

104
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,749
One of us is.

105
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,367
Ollie?

106
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,986
Where do you keep
the bottle opener

107
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,171
on this thing?

108
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,457
I'll be there in
a minute, Sarah.

109
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,762
You know, son,

110
00:06:56,764 --> 00:07:00,466
that is not
going to finish well

111
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:03,519
for either of them
or for you.

112
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,074
What did I tell you?

113
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:10,559
Yachts suck.

114
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:14,813
Tommy Merlyn.

115
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,116
I missed you, buddy.

116
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,400
Ok. What else did
you miss?

117
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:21,570
Super bowl winners... Giants,
Steelers, Saints, Packers,

118
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,706
Giants again.

119
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,241
A black president,
that's new.

120
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,876
Oh, and "Lost," they
were all dead...

121
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,129
I think.

122
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:31,497
What was it like there?

123
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,185
Cold.

124
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,537
Tomorrow, you and me,
we're doing the city.

125
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,055
You've got a lot
to catch up on.

126
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,924
That sounds like
a great idea.

127
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,059
Good. Then I was hoping
to swing by the office.

128
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,679
Well, there's
plenty of time for all that.

129
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:49,815
Queen Consolidated isn't
going anywhere.

130
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,067
Oh, I am
so sorry, Mr. Oliver.

131
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,121
Dude, you speak Russian?

132
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,190
I didn't realize you took
Russian at college, Oliver.

133
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,575
I didn't realize

134
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,694
you wanted to sleep with my
mother, Walter.

135
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,870
I didn't say anything.

136
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,222
She didn't have to.

137
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,043
Oliver...

138
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,612
Walter and I are
married,

139
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:22,381
and I don't want you
to think

140
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,082
that either one of
us did anything

141
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,601
to disrespect
your father.

142
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,753
We both believed that
Robert, like you, was,

143
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,738
uh, well, gone.

144
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,774
It's fine.

145
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,532
May I be excused?

146
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,956
Hey, don't forget
about tomorrow, buddy.

147
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,968
1, 2, 3.

148
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,337
It's getting closer.

149
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,089
That's not
very scientific.

150
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,924
What would you know
about science,

151
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,010
Mr. Ivy league
dropout?

152
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,345
I happen to know a lot
about science.

153
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,063
I know about
fermentation.

154
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,982
I know biology.

155
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:18,320
Laurel's gonna kill me.

156
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:19,688
Oh, she's so gonna kill me.

157
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,075
Your sister
will never know.

158
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,193
Come here.

159
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,911
Ha ha!

160
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,780
Ok, that one was
really close.

161
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:30,749
Sarah, we're
gonna be fine.

162
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:42,544
Sarah?

163
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:45,347
Sarah!

164
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,770
Sarah!
Oliver!

165
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,939
Sarah! Sarah!

166
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,841
Gus?

167
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,529
No! No!

168
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,114
No! Dad, she's out there!

169
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,482
She's not there.

170
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,033
Sarah!

171
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,787
She's gone.

172
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,623
Oliver, wake up. Oliver?

173
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,409
Oliver!

174
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm sorry. I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

175
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,552
Oh, it's ok, Oliver.

176
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,055
It's all right,
sweetheart.

177
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,141
You're home.

178
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,042
You're home.

179
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,463
Where did you
get these?

180
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:06,049
Roxies. Thank you,
daddy's ACL tear.

181
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,254
Ollie.

182
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,389
No one's called me
that in a while, Speedy.

183
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,591
Worst nickname ever.

184
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,426
What, always chasing
after me as a kid?

185
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,811
I thought it fit
pretty well.

186
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,580
Maybe it still does.

187
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:23,649
See you at school, Speedy.

188
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,935
Sorry about her.

189
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,320
I have something
for you.

190
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,322
You did not come back
from a deserted island

191
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:30,623
with a souvenir.

192
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,274
It's a Hozen.
And in buddhism,

193
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,960
it symbolizes
reconnecting.

194
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,412
I kept it in hopes
that one day,

195
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,281
it would reconnect
me with you.

196
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,953
A rock!
That is sweet.

197
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,621
You know, I want
one of those

198
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,390
t-shirts that says
"my friend was

199
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,892
a castaway, and all I got
was this crappy shirt."

200
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,314
Don't let him get you
into too much trouble.

201
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,266
You just got back.
Take it slow.

202
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,738
Ahem.
The city awaits.

203
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,643
Have you noticed how hot
your sister's gotten?

204
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,529
Because I have not.

205
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,781
# it's been
a long night... #

206
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:12,832
Your funeral blew.

207
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,333
Did you get lucky?

208
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:15,535
Fish in a barrel.

209
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:18,487
They were so sad...

210
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,705
No.
And huggy.

211
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:20,873
And I am counting

212
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,091
on another target
rich environment

213
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:23,509
for your welcome
home bash.

214
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:24,677
At my what?

215
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,429
You came back from
the dead.

216
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,097
This calls for
a party.

217
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:29,599
You tell me
where and when.

218
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,601
I'll take care
of everything.

219
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,856
And this city's
gone to crap.

220
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,141
Your dad sold
his factory

221
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,442
just in time.

222
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:41,227
And why'd you want
to drive through

223
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,613
this neighborhood
anyway?

224
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:44,764
No reason.

225
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,948
So what'd you miss
the most,

226
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,066
steaks at the palm,

227
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,317
drinks at
the station,

228
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,469
meaningless sex?

229
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,621
Laurel.

230
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:54,624
Everyone is happy
you're alive.

231
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:57,160
You want to see the
one person who isn't?

232
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,963
Laurel, I just got this
from Hunt's lawyers.

233
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,381
They filed
a change of venue.

234
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,083
We are now in front
of Judge Grell.

235
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,585
Hunt funded Grell's
reelection campaign.

236
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,752
Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,204
He's got Grell in
his back pocket.

238
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,672
You know, it's fun
being your friend.

239
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,390
I get to say "I told
you so" a lot.

240
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,226
No. Adam Hunt is
not smarter than we are.

241
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,677
No, he's just richer
and willing to commit

242
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,895
multiple felonies.

243
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,396
We don't need to go
outside the law...

244
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,398
"to find justice."

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,134
Your dad's favorite
jingle.

246
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,936
Hello, Laurel.

247
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,612
You went to law school.
You said you would.

248
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,615
Yeah. Everyone's proud.

249
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,035
Adam Hunt's
a heavy hitter.

250
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,753
You sure you want to get
in the ring with him?

251
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:45,124
Five years and you want
to talk about Adam Hunt?

252
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,628
No. Not really.

253
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,631
Why are you here, Ollie?

254
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,049
To apologize.

255
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,051
It was my fault.

256
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:58,638
I wanted to ask you
not to blame her.

257
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,089
For what?

258
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,641
Falling under your spell.

259
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:04,426
How could I possibly blame
her for doing the same things

260
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,645
that I did?

261
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,979
I never meant to...

262
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,431
she was my sister.

263
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,284
I couldn't be angry

264
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,402
because she was dead.

265
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,071
I couldn't grieve because
I was so angry.

266
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,656
That's what happens when
your sister dies

267
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,291
while screwing
your boyfriend.

268
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,279
We buried an empty coffin...

269
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,616
Because her body was at
the bottom of the ocean

270
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,969
where you left her.

271
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,940
It should have been you.

272
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,626
I know that it's too
late to say this,

273
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,228
but I'm sorry.

274
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,099
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

275
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,735
I'd hoped that you'd rot
in hell a whole lot longer

276
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:47,469
than 5 years.

277
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,608
How did you think that
was gonna go, Tommy?

278
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,644
About like that.

279
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,698
Ok, so we took care
of that. Good call.

280
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,199
Now we can make up
for lost time.

281
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,701
If you're not
too sick of fish,

282
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,202
I suggest we find
some leggy models

283
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,154
and eat Sushi all
day. What do you say?

284
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,673
What're they doing?
What the hell?

285
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,928
Hey!

286
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,690
Here, son. Drink.

287
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,945
What the hell
are you doing?!

288
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,147
That's all
we've got.

289
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:32,481
If anybody's making it
out of here,

290
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,899
it's gonna be him.

291
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,038
I'm so sorry. I thought
I'd have more time.

292
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm not the man you
think I am.

293
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,827
I didn't build
our city.

294
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,028
I failed it.

295
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,797
And I wasn't
the only one.

296
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,799
Mr. Queen.

297
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,634
Mr. Queen!

298
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,087
Did your father
survive that accident?

299
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,377
I ask the questions.
You give me the answers.

300
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,407
Did he make it
to the island?

301
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,742
Did he tell you anything?

302
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,242
Yes, he did.

303
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,545
What did he tell you,
Mr. Queen?

304
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,127
He told me
I'm gonna kill you.

305
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,451
You're delusional.

306
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,153
You're zip-cuffed
to that chair.

307
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,790
Not anymore.

308
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,014
You killed that man.

309
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,466
You don't have
to do this.

310
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:06,435
Yes, I do.

311
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,103
Nobody can know my secret.

312
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,421
So that's your story.
A guy in a green hood

313
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:21,306
flew in and single-handedly
took out 3 armed kidnappers.

314
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,458
I mean, who is he?

315
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,643
Why would he do that?

316
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:29,246
I don't know. Find
him and you can ask.

317
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:34,051
Yeah. What about you?

318
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,495
You see the hood guy?

319
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,456
I saw...

320
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,407
Just movement.

321
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,644
Everything blurry.
I was kind of out of it.

322
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:43,979
Yeah.

323
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,615
It's funny, isn't it?
One day back,

324
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,984
and already somebody's
gunning for you.

325
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,736
Aren't you popular?

326
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:54,523
Were you able
to identify the men?

327
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,842
Scrubbed identities,
untraceable weapons.

328
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,343
These were pros.

329
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,328
Yeah. Well, they
probably figured you'd

330
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,779
pay a king's ransom
to get your boy back

331
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:03,231
or a Queen's ransom,

332
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,133
as it were.

333
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,603
After all, a parent
would do anything

334
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,138
to keep
their child safe.

335
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,809
I don't find your
tone appropriate, Detective.

336
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,528
If Oliver can think
of anything else,

337
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,896
he'll be in touch.

338
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,348
Thank you,
gentlemen,

339
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,566
for coming.

340
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:31,476
Your luck never seems
to run out, does it?

341
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,471
You are different.

342
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,673
Not like you to read
a book.

343
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,177
I missed you, Raisa.

344
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,246
No kitchen on
the island.

345
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,832
No. No friends either.

346
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,785
Hey.

347
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:16,821
Thank you.

348
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,426
Do I really seem different?

349
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,162
No. You're still
a good boy.

350
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,131
Oh, I think we both
know I wasn't.

351
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,582
But a good heart.

352
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:28,967
I hope so.

353
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,753
I want to be the person you
always told me I could be.

354
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:39,678
Oliver, I want to
introduce you to someone...

355
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,896
John Diggle.

356
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,831
He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

357
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,065
I don't need a babysitter.

358
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,318
Darling, Oliver's
a grown man.

359
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,369
And if he
doesn't feel he needs

360
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,553
armed protection...

361
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,221
Yeah, I understand,
but this is

362
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,073
something I need.

363
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:57,913
So...

364
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,416
What do I call you?

365
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,704
Diggle's good.

366
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,122
Dig if you want.

367
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:08,456
You're ex-military?

368
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,741
Yes, sir.
105th airborne

369
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,676
of of Kandahar,
retired.

370
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:12,794
Been in
the private sector

371
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:15,297
a little more than
4 years now.

372
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,265
I don't want there to be
any confusion, Mr. Queen.

373
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,800
My ability to keep
you from harm

374
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:20,435
will outweigh
your comfort.

375
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:23,688
Do we have
an agreement?

376
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:27,192
Sir?

377
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:30,862
Sir!

378
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,771
The abduction was unexpected.

379
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,273
It forced me
to move up my plans,

380
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,359
but what I told
the police was true.

381
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:20,745
The man in the green hood
was there in that warehouse,

382
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,647
and he's just beginning.

383
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,071
The suit alleges
that Hunt committed

384
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:54,923
multiple acts of fraud
and theft

385
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,257
against the city's
underprivileged.

386
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,510
Laurel Lance, an attorney
for the city necessary...

387
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,011
Adam Hunt...

388
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,297
his crimes go deeper
than fraud and theft,

389
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,350
but he's been able to
bully, bribe, or kill anyone

390
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:07,418
who's gotten into his way.

391
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,694
He hasn't met me yet.

392
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,652
You remind Grell I put
him on the bench,

393
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:25,954
I can take him off.

394
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:28,105
I will turn him into
a cautionary tale.

395
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,207
Yes, Mr. Hunt.

396
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,708
And this attorney
Laurel Lance...

397
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,610
you said she wasn't gonna
be a problem anymore.

398
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:36,614
I told you to fix
that situation.

399
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,466
Why are you
still here?

400
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,122
Unh!

401
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,341
Get in the car!

402
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,631
Hey. You missed.

403
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,682
Unh!

404
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,571
Aah!

405
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:05,827
Unh! Aah!

406
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,829
What? What?

407
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:10,048
Just... just tell me
what you want.

408
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,335
You're gonna transfer
$40 million

409
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:17,038
into Starling city
bank account 1141

410
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
by 10 P.M. tomorrow night.
Or what?

411
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:21,876
Or I'm gonna take it,
and you won't like how.

412
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:27,682
If I see you again,
you're dead!

413
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,396
He was wearing a hood,

414
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:42,598
a green hood,

415
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,651
and he had
a bow and arrow.

416
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:47,269
What, you don't
believe me?

417
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:51,273
That maniac put two
of my men in the hospital.

418
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,608
Well, thanks
for your statement.

419
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,329
We'll put out an APB
on... Robin hood.

420
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,314
Hey, pal.

421
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm not some grocer who got
taken for his register.

422
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:05,120
I go to the front
of the line.

423
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:07,206
Now he said he would be
back here by 10 P.M.

424
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,124
Make sure
you're here first.

425
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:12,661
You can coordinate with Mr. Drakon,
my new head of security.

426
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,837
All right. Well, uh,
thanks for your time.

427
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:30,396
It looks like Queen
was telling the truth.

428
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,848
Yeah. Well, there's a first
time for everything.

429
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:38,687
This hooded guy comes looking
for trouble, he'll find it.

430
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:52,101
Put on your
seat belt, sir.

431
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,936
Wouldn't want you
to miss your party.

432
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,209
# This beat's
for all my freaks #

433
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,479
# Time to lose my mind #

434
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,647
# 'cause I work damn hard #

435
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,050
# So I'll play damn hard #

436
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:11,103
# Lost in the night #

437
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:13,322
# 'cause I work damn hard #

438
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:15,274
# So I'll play damn hard #

439
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:22,865
# I, I, I, I work-ork-ork
damn har-har-har-hard #

440
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,733
# I, I, I, I #

441
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,619
Everybody, hey!

442
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:32,574
Man of the hour!

443
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,844
Whoo! And, ladies, please give
this man a proper homecoming.

444
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:39,681
# We are the champions #

445
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,967
# We are the champions #

446
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:44,887
Thank you very much,
everybody!

447
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,588
Ollie, Ollie,
Ollie, Ollie.

448
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,112
I missed Tequila!

449
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,240
What the hell's
going on out there?

450
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,108
It's across
the street.

451
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,294
Party for the guy that got
rescued off that island...

452
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,963
Oliver Queen.

453
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,622
Hey. Does he wipe
for you, too?

454
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:25,961
Now by my rough estimate, you
have not had sex in 1,839 days.

455
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,763
As your wingman,
I highly recommend

456
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:29,297
Carmen Golden.

457
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,516
Which one is she?

458
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,351
The one who looks like the
chick from "Twilight."

459
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:33,852
What's "Twilight"?

460
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,687
You're so better off
not knowing.

461
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:46,915
Back in a minute.

462
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,671
Ollie, hey!
This party is sick.

463
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:53,922
Who let you
in here?

464
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,290
I believe it was
somebody who said,

465
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,125
"right this way,
Miss Queen."

466
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,344
Well, you shouldn't
be here.

467
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,379
I'm not 12 anymore.

468
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,330
No. You're 17.

469
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,266
Ollie, I love you,

470
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:06,602
but you can't come back
here and judge me,

471
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:08,136
especially for being
just like you.

472
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,856
I know that it couldn't have been
easy for you when I was away...

473
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:14,843
away? No. You died.

474
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,563
My brother
and my father died.

475
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,314
I went
to your funerals.

476
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:20,616
I know.
No, you don't.

477
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:24,369
Mom had Walter,
and I had no one.

478
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,238
You guys all act
like it's cool,

479
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,657
let's forget about
the last 5 years.

480
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,459
Well, I can't.

481
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:32,160
For me, it's kind of
permanently in there,

482
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:33,629
so I'm sorry
if I turned out

483
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,530
some major
disappointment,

484
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:38,366
but this me is
the best I could do

485
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:42,387
with what I had
to work with.

486
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,256
Let's bounce.

487
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,208
You have
the fun dip?

488
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,394
Yeah. It's right...

489
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:52,064
no. I... I must have
dropped it.

490
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,724
Oh! Oh.

491
00:30:02,726 --> 00:30:04,276
You're here.

492
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,112
Tommy. He made the
point that we have

493
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,530
too many years
between us

494
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:12,000
to leave things the
way we left them.

495
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:15,037
Is there someplace quieter
that we could go?

496
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,288
Yeah.

497
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,761
I'm sorry about saying that you
should have been the one who died.

498
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:26,932
That was wrong.

499
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,051
If I could trade places
with her, I would.

500
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,222
About Sarah.

501
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,660
There's something that
I've been afraid to ask,

502
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:41,229
but I need to know.

503
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,597
Ok.

504
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,202
When she died...

505
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,323
Did she suffer?

506
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,991
Sarah!
Aah!

507
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:55,961
No.

508
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:58,446
I think about her
every day.

509
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:01,667
Me, too.

510
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,136
I guess we still have
one thing in common then.

511
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:11,510
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

512
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,578
If you need someone
to talk to

513
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,131
about what happened
to you, I'm here.

514
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:26,742
Something wrong?

515
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:29,861
I asked somebody
to do something.

516
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:31,346
They didn't do it.

517
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,668
Laurel...

518
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:46,344
You always saw
the best in me.

519
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,880
Right now, that's
what you're doing,

520
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,299
looking at me,
and you're wondering

521
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:53,101
if that island
changed me somehow,

522
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:55,336
if it made me
a better person.

523
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,622
It didn't.

524
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,274
Stay away from me.

525
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,509
Otherwise...

526
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:05,680
I'm just gonna
hurt you again,

527
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:09,401
but this time,
it will be worse.

528
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:11,403
Got to roll.

529
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:16,241
I got 5 years of
debauchery to catch up on

530
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,692
you know what, Oliver?

531
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,548
You're wrong. That
island did change you.

532
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,667
At least now
you're honest.

533
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,849
Something I can
help you with, sir?

534
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:46,238
I just wanted a second
to myself.

535
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,522
I would believe you,
Mr. Queen,

536
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:50,826
if you weren't
so full of crap.

537
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,494
Party's this way.

538
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,917
It's locked.

539
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,791
You two cover
the elevator.

540
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:07,092
Hang back and be ready.

541
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,410
Stay in the corners
and stay alert.

542
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:18,753
It's past 10:00.

543
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,421
He's never getting
in here.

544
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,652
All's clear.

545
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:34,820
Yeah.

546
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,607
Unh!

547
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,913
You missed.

548
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:19,197
Really?

549
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,448
Hunh!

550
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,539
He's here!

551
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,959
All units, converge!
All units, converge!

552
00:34:58,621 --> 00:34:59,854
Aigh!

553
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,239
Go right, go right.

554
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,373
On me.

555
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,836
Lay down your weapons,
or we will open fire!

556
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,288
I repeat, lay down
your weapons.

557
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:51,603
Tell me
you saw that.

558
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,522
Ok. Let's go. Move.

559
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,775
# Girls, girls, girls #

560
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:58,077
# Hot babes #

561
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,027
Cut it.

562
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:00,612
Search the building
roof to basement.

563
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:02,030
Find him!

564
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:03,082
Starling City police!

565
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,333
The party's over, kids.

566
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:09,505
Oh, Mr. Merlyn. Imagine my
shock at finding you here.

567
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,924
Did you roofie anyone
special tonight, huh?

568
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:15,294
Detective!
It's a private party.

569
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,995
Yeah? Well, there was an incident
at Adam Hunt's building tonight.

570
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:18,514
You know anything
about that?

571
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,132
Who's Adam Hunt?

572
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,667
He's a millionaire bottom feeder, and I'm
kind of surprised you aren't friends.

573
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:25,437
I've been out of town
for... A while.

574
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,724
Yeah. Well, he just got attacked
by the guy with the hood,

575
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:30,809
the guy that saved
your ass the other day.

576
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,060
The hood guy.

577
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:33,178
You didn't find him?

578
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,396
I'm gonna offer
a reward.

579
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:37,032
Hey, everybody.
$2 million to anybody

580
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,351
that can find a nut bar
in a green hood.

581
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,876
Did you even try
to save her?

582
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,294
Ok. Let's go, partner.

583
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:51,029
Did you even try
to save my daughter?

584
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,331
Sarah wouldn't want this.

585
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,534
It's not.
Partner, let's go.

586
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:57,085
It's all right.
Let's go.

587
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:05,710
It's way too quiet
in here!

588
00:37:05,712 --> 00:37:07,429
This is a party!

589
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,104
Some coincidence, I mean, you
asking to have your party here,

590
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:17,856
and Hunt getting robbed
right next door

591
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:21,493
and by the same guy who
rescued us at the warehouse.

592
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,162
If I were you,
Tommy,

593
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:25,581
I'd just be glad
you're alive.

594
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,700
What happened to you
on that island?

595
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,118
A lot.

596
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,627
What the hell
are you talking about?

597
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:43,348
$40 million doesn't
just up and vanish!

598
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,633
Untraceable?!

599
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:48,420
It is $40 million!
Find it!

600
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:52,357
How did he do it?

601
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:32,097
There's not enough
for all of us.

602
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,599
Save your strength.

603
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:37,519
You can survive
this, make it home,

604
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:41,473
make it better,
right my wrongs,

605
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,358
but you got to live
through this first.

606
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:47,195
You hear me, Ollie?
You hear me, son?

607
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,834
Just rest, dad.

608
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:03,512
No.

609
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,644
Dad?!

610
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,445
Survive.

611
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:21,446
No!

612
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,576
If hypothetically
$50,000 magically appeared

613
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:37,129
in your bank account,
it might be best

614
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:39,298
for you not to
speak about it...

615
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,969
To anyone... Ever.

616
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:46,805
God bless you, too.

617
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,440
I just got a very
grateful phone call

618
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:51,009
from one of our clients
against Adam Hunt.

619
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,511
Me, too. Heh.

620
00:39:56,567 --> 00:40:02,187
It looks like Starling
City has a guardian angel.

621
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,606
By the way, your
cute friend's here.

622
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,030
You left the party
pretty quick last night,

623
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,033
even after I made sure the bar
was stocked with Pinot Noir.

624
00:40:15,035 --> 00:40:16,918
It wasn't really
my scene.

625
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,339
I thought maybe you and Oliver
went mano-a-mano again.

626
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:21,840
I saw you two
head out.

627
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:25,293
There's nothing between
Oliver and I, not anymore.

628
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:28,747
Here I thought the only thing
between you and Oliver was us.

629
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:32,934
I wouldn't exactly characterize
us as an "us," Tommy.

630
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,252
Then what would
you call it?

631
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:35,387
A lapse.

632
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,555
That's quite
a few lapses...

633
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:38,240
your place,
my place,

634
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:41,643
my place again.

635
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,928
Oh, come on, Merlyn. We
both know that you're not

636
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,031
a one-girl type of guy.

637
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,950
Depends on the girl.

638
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:50,819
I have to go
back to work.

639
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:57,609
Dinah Laurel Lance always
trying to save the world.

640
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:02,047
Hey. If I don't try
and save it, who will?

641
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:07,002
# Let's get out of here #

642
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:10,639
# won't you come along? #

643
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,962
She says the island changed me.

644
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:24,403
She has no idea how much.

645
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:27,072
There are many more names
on the list,

646
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:32,661
those who rule my city
through intimidation and fear.

647
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:36,698
Every last one of them will
wish I had died on that island.

648
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:50,045
The police failed to identify the
men I hired to kidnap Oliver,

649
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:52,097
and they never will.

650
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,516
Should we arrange
another abduction?

651
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:56,518
No.

652
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,771
There are other ways of finding
out what my son knows.
