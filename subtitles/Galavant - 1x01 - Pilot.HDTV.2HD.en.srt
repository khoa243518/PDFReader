Tensions are high, and maybe take five?

7
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:20,655
Sorry. I was just catching people up.

8
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:21,856
All right, gang.

9
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,659
I realize now that I've been going about

10
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:27,295
getting us out of here the wrong way.

11
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,131
I was thinking of big, strong hero moves,

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,599
but, um...

13
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,134
Well, I think that was just ego stuff.

14
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,037
So I've come up with a plan

15
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,806
that involves gaining
King Richard's confidence

16
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:39,974
using my wits.

17
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,644
We believe in you, Galavant. We trust you.

18
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,345
- Right, everyone?
- Mm...

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,381
No, he's got this.

20
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:48,883
Galavant's the complete package,

21
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:52,920
and I for one am finally just
throwing my arms in the air

22
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,222
and giving in to it.

23
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,426
Are they gonna kiss?

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,427
Yeah, they are.

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,864
Thank you so much.

26
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,602
Hi.

27
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:08,970
So, if you keep ignoring

28
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,939
the Russian bathhouse-like steam
surrounding you and Isabella,

29
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:14,575
you could find yourself in
the permanent friend zone.

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,545
So are you gonna, as they say...

31
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,248
"Kiss de girl," huh?

32
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,752
I don't know what's wrong with me, Sid.

33
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,021
This thing with her is just so big.

34
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:31,726
I feel like a kiss with Isabella
could just go on forever.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,261
What has happened to you?

36
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:39,066
2:00. Time for lunch.

37
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:41,469
Enjoy yourselves.

38
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,904
You can have the fat one.

39
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,474
Wait a minute.

40
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:48,376
Gareth...

41
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,377
What?

42
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,478
I demand an audience with the king.

43
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:51,645
Oh, do you?

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,147
And what makes you think
he'll grant you that?

45
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,951
'Cause I've got some very
mean gossip about Madalena.

46
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:59,620
And you think the king's
gonna drop everything

47
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,256
just to hear some
scuttlebutt about some girl?

48
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,327
She's got feet like a 90-year-old troll.

49
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,728
It's delicious!

50
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:08,829
No, it's disgusting.

51
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,898
She's got bunions, gnarled knuckles, warts.

52
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,299
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,902
That's why she wears her socks in bed.

54
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,105
I haven't laughed so hard in minutes.

55
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,208
Anyway, the point is, we've both
been scorned by the same woman.

56
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,977
I just thought you'd like to know that.

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,514
Good night...

58
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,016
Unless you want to get a drink.

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,585
That's an interesting proposition.

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,220
Little guy time between frenemies

61
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,589
burnt by the same flame,
bros before hos, all that.

62
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,324
No, I don't think so.

63
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,659
The king needs to get his sleep.

64
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,627
Gareth, why do you always
have to poop on the party?

65
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,696
Maybe because you've got
to fight me to the death

66
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:43,731
in the morning,

67
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,365
or maybe that your brother has decided

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,001
that I'm gonna be his champion,
and for the first time ever,

69
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,170
you've decided to fight
one of your own battles,

70
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:51,805
and your whole kingdom's at stake.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,940
Does that ring any bells?

72
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,076
Aw, you worried about me, Gar-bear?

73
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,377
Don't call me that.

74
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,645
Well, I'm so sorry if I upset you

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
the night before you'll probably kill me!

76
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,016
This sucks.

77
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,919
Gareth, do you remember the lullaby

78
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,921
Pearl used to sing to us when we were boys?

79
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,089
Pearl was our nanny.

80
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,857
Old woman, sweet face, big, gigantic boobs.

81
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,426

Well, fine!

86
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:25,172
I didn't want to sing the
stupid song with you anyway!

87
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,875
Let's have that drink.

88
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,879
Shall we?

You must have felt badly.

91
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,761
Madalena absolutely destroyed me.

92
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:42,762
Drink up, drink up.

93
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,296
I couldn't get out of bed.

94
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,365
I didn't play my lute for weeks.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,267
What, you think you've got it bad?

96
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,935
Madalena and I never even...

97
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,036
Well, let's just say

98
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,172
she never let me walk through her garden.

99
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,907
I don't follow.

100
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,576
I never pollinated her flower.

101
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,978
What?

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,214
Are we talking about the same Madalena?

103
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:03,616
Yes!

104
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,317
But you were married.

105
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:07,119
You didn't insist?

106
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,288
I'm not an animal.

107
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,123
I mean, sure, I'll kidnap a woman

108
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,491
and force her to marry me,

109
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:14,894
but after that, I'm all
about a woman's rights.

110
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,662
I'm a modern, 13th-century man.

111
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,297
Good for you. Cheers to that.

112
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:19,398
Thank you very much.

113
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:20,766
You know, the truth be told,

114
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,635
I've always sort of felt that that business

115
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,236
should never happen until two people

116
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,771
really love each other, you know?

117
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,474
Oh, yeah, yeah.

118
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:31,844
I never loved anyone
until I loved Madalena,

119
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:35,714
and so that's why I'm...

120
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,486
I've never actually
walked in anyone's garden.

121
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:43,989
But you're the king.

122
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,057
That's right.

123
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,159
I am the king, so watch your mouth, boy.

124
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,129
I'm sorry I barked at you.

125
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,830
See? This is why I don't have guy friends.

126
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,398
Hey, it's all right, it's all right.

127
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,400
- You're under a lot of pressure.
- I know.

128
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,768
Brother's trying to steal your kingdom.

129
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:57,903
He's trying to steal your lady,

130
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,638
put you against your best friend.

131
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,106
Times are tough. Drink up.

132
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,408
- Here, let's... let's play a game.
- Hmm?

133
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:06,211
Let's just say there's this standing king.

134
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:07,913
And his evil, treacherous brother

135
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,181
comes into town,

136
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,816
and we wanted to sort of
"take care" of him.

137
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,584
I don't know, like, say, tonight.

138
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:13,952
Do you think anyone would care?

139
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,255
I don't follow.

140
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,456
Kill your brother.

141
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:19,958
What?!

142
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:21,793
Have you gone absolutely mad?

143
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:22,961
What do you expect me to do,

144
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:24,997
just sneak into Kingsley's bedchamber

145
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,032
and slice his throat while he sleeps?

146
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,133
What, in this outfit?!

147
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,134
Yes.

148
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,508
Everyone, I'm going to kill my brother!

149
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,076
Drinks are on me!

150
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,646

00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,977
Hey, w-what are all these dudes doing

182
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,746
in front of Madalena's room for?

183
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,147
Yeah, what is it? A party?

184
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,382
T-the queen's interviewing new consorts.

185
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,852
Next!

186
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,553
Oh, God. She's the worst.

187
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:56,755
Hey, you know what?

188
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,524
The queen is really proud of her feet.

189
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:00,725
Mm. Yeah, yeah.

190
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,027
Ask her to take her socks off.

191
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,562
Ask to kiss her feet.

192
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,831
That's an order from your king.

Hey, everybody!

198
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,678
Whoa. It looks like
someone couldn't do anything

199
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,813
if I went like this!

200
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,382
Stop it! I'm ticklish!

201
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,218
Hi, pretty Izzy.

202
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,686
Oh, you're so pretty.

203
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,089
But not just face, your brain.

204
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:34,525
It's like your beautiful brain
exploded all over your face.

205
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,693
Are you drunk?

206
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:38,062
Mommy.

207
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:41,933
Hey, I'm so excited about
Isabella getting older.

208
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,002
Way to keep it high and tight.

209
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,104
Oh, look, it's the little
stickman in the red.

210
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,606
- Hello.
- He remembered you!

211
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,608
I should have just kissed you.

212
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,410
I should have kissed you ages ago.

213
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,579
Yeah, well, um, maybe we
should talk about this tomorrow.

214
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:55,713
Okay, bye-bye.

215
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:58,583
Yes, and we will, and we're gonna kiss,

216
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:00,918
and it's gonna be one of
those forever sort of kisses.

217
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:02,754
Tell her, Sid. Didn't I say that earlier?

218
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,522
When I sat down over
there, I said it, didn't I?

219
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,590
Burned into my brain, sir.

220
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:06,924
You see?

221
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:08,960
Boop!

222
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,295
Okay, I've got to go kill a king.

223
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,197
I beg of you, sire, stop it!

224
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,665
Bye, everybody!

225
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,501
Thank you, thank you!

226
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:18,536

I just want to say thanks for tonight.

233
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,749
I really needed to get out.

234
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,284
Just focus!

235
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:34,986
You want to kill him in the head,

236
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,821
or do you want to kill him in the neck?

237
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,889
Right. Here we go.

238
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,992
Hey! Oh, and promise me
you're not gonna say anything

239
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,460
to anyone about that thing I said.

240
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,762
What thing? About me being a virgin.

241
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,197
I think we've heard enough.

242
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,065
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

243
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,904
My dear, little, dinky brother,
untouched by war and women.

244
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,174
I mean, what I meant was virgin slayer.

245
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:00,878
You're [Bleep].

246
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,642
Throw lover boy in a dungeon.

247
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,644
So mean.

248
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,946
Oh, and you won't be needing this.

249
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:13,348
My crown!

250
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:15,317
He stole my crown.

251
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:18,319
Keep your chin up. Don't
let them see you cry.

252
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,055
Never let them see you cry.

253
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,258
Gareth, I assume you like women.

254
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:26,828
If you fight for me, I
will give you land, a title,

255
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:29,264
and as many women as you desire.

256
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,032
What's your type?

257
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,101
Either really fat or really skinny,

258
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:34,269
nothing in between.

259
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:35,637
I'll give you fat and skinny.

260
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,439
I'll get back to you.

261
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,080
Awesome.

262
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,183
It was so rude!

263
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:51,285
Who does that to my favorite crown?

264
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,354
Did you know that? I
got it for my birthday!

265
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,424
- Galavant...
- Izzy, you're so pretty.

266
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:03,698
Oh, well, at least he stopped talking.

267
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,799
Yeah, it's great. Yeah. About time.

268
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,068
I failed in my mission, Gareth,

269
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,136
and now it's our last night

270
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,670
before we have to duel to the death.

271
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,742
Come on, let's sing Pearl's song together,

272
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,110
for old times' sake.

273
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:18,112
Shut up.

274
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,281
I've told you your whole
life to grow a pair,

275
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:23,017
and you just won't listen, and
now you're gonna die for it.

276
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,219
Even though I'm the one
who's gonna kill you,

277
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:26,454
it's not my fault!

278
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,656
It's not my fault!

279
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,124
I warned you!

280
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,940

Ow.

305
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,857
Hi.

306
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,158
How are you?

307
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,560
Oh, God. Ow.

308
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,863
Rough night?

309
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,765
I don't remember what happened.

310
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,299
You said her pretty brain exploded

311
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,601
and went all over her face.

312
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:55,802
And you tried to kiss her.

313
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,203
You were a bit of a mess, sir.

314
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,405
A big, hot mess.

315
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,674
Well, that's the least of our problems.

316
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,509
I think I might have
ruined our only chance,

317
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,977
and now I don't know what to do.

318
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,046
Good thing I do. Wake up, sire.

319
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,114
We've come to get you out of here.

320
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:10,784
Oh, God.

321
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:14,554
Well, I knew you cared.

322
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:15,688
Take him outside.

323
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,056
This place is horrible.

324
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,925
All right, everyone, take
only the bare essentials.

325
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,693
We can always pick up
odds and ends on the road.

326
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,729
None of you are coming, except you.

327
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,397
What? You're coming with me.

328
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm not going anywhere, not
without everyone in here.

329
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:29,002
You don't have a choice, son.

330
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,045
Listen, I remember what I said last night,

331
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,913
and I meant every word.

332
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:42,915
I think you're the most wonderful...

333
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,290
I think I'm falling in love.

334
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:55,628
Nice kiss. I hope he remembers it.

335
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:57,030
Come on, you.

336
00:13:57,064 --> 00:13:58,832
Galavant, no!

337
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,767
Please, Gareth!

338
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,635
Princess, as long as Galavant's alive,

339
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,404
we stand a chance of being rescued.

340
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,772
What's this?

341
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:15,841
Where am I?

342
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,476
These pirates will take you and the king

343
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,111
back to his kingdom, where he'll be safe.

344
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,145
What? No.

345
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,613
I'm not leaving her.

346
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,881
I'm going back.

347
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,783
I've left word with my men.

348
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,952
You step one foot in that castle

349
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:29,254
and everyone you love gets the ax.

350
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,822
No more games, Galavant.

351
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,391
Listen, Gareth, I'm moved,
but I've made my bed,

352
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,327
and for once, I should lie in it.

353
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,429
- You get in that boat.
- No, Gareth.

354
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:38,897
I know you're doing
this because you love me.

355
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,732
I don't love you. I don't even like you.

356
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,168
No one here likes you, so go.

357
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:45,070
Well, now you're just
being mean to me so I'll go.

358
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:46,571
You're self-centered,
self-absorbed,

359
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:47,839
and you wear too much velvet.

360
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,274
Now you're just going into
a lot of specific details,

361
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:50,475
so I'll believe you.

362
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,077
You have a skinny left
calf and a crooked...

363
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:54,646
Okay, okay, fine. I'll go.

364
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,482
But you're not fooling anyone.

365
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,418
Go on. And you.

366
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:03,021
Not one hair.

367
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,157
I give you my word.

368
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,293
And know this... I will return for them.

369
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,427
Justice will be done.

370
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:10,762
I'm excited for you,

371
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,598
but let me give you a
couple of instructions.

372
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,800
He can't sleep at night

373
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,669
if he ain't got a second pillow to hug.

374
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,404
Dairy makes him gassy.

375
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:22,173
And if he gets cross,
give him some salty snacks.

376
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,875
It's good for his electrolytes.

377
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,744
But if one hair on his head gets harmed,

378
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,414
I will hunt you down, I will gut you,

379
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,950
and I will use your skin as a lap blanket.

380
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,117
Do you understand?

381
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:36,454
We have a deal.

382
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,897
All right, shove off, me hearties.

383
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,999

Well, why don't you help yourself wake up

by going down to the dungeon
and killing everyone who's left?

395
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:39,650
Okay. It will be my pleasure.

396
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:54,031
Okay, here's the plan.

397
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,867
One of you is gonna knock
me out and take my keys.

398
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:58,803
What? You're not going to kill us?

399
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:00,037
I keep my promises,

400
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,373
and I promised your little lover boy

401
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:03,474
that I'd take care of you.

402
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:05,209
So who's first?

403
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,744
Come on.

404
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,151

Next.

407
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:34,338
Just take the keys and go.

408
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,173
Not you. You're coming with me.

409
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,307
Why?

410
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:40,244
I think I'll keep you for insurance.

411
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:42,679
Just go! I'll be fine.
Just get everyone to safety.

412
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:43,747
I'll come back for you.

413
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:46,550
Please do! So scared!

414
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:56,260
Gareth, did you kill everyone
who needed to be killed?

415
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:57,861
No, milady.

416
00:17:57,895 --> 00:18:00,864
What kind of kingdom are you running here?

417
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,266
A henchman that doesn't kill,

418
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,003
a queen who does nothing about it.

419
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:09,139
This place has gone soft...

420
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:18,181
Turns out he wasn't my type.

421
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:30,460
You just got a promotion.

422
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,697
Sit.

423
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:48,645
You're gonna have to either
lose or gain a lot of weight.

424
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,927
We had nowhere else to go.

425
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,262
You really hurt my feelings, Izzy.

426
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:09,732
I don't think I want to be
your future husband anymore.

427

00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:34,892
He's a  you  thing up

79
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,961
you in the  chair

80
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,629
with the  and knees

81
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,366
is taking it
out that son

82
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,701
Good Lord, Gareth.

83
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,469
Do you kiss my ring with that mouth?

84
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,371
My mum taught me that one.

85
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,573
Oof.

86
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:54,545
Now, if that fool is tickling
my wife's funny bone,

87
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,714
it leaves me no choice.

88
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:59,116
I know what I have to do.

89
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,091
Hello, jester.

90
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,526
Do you think I'm an idiot?

91
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:15,499
I know precisely what you have
been doing with my wife.

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,002
Aah!

93
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,671
It's a bendy sword.

94
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:21,839
Isn't that fantastic?

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,774
Oh!

96
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,777
Not even a giggle.

97
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:30,881
See, this is precisely
why I need your help.

98
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,683
Please teach me to be funny.

99
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,318
I'm begging you.

100
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,619
- Gah!
- Ohh!

101
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,287
- Oh!
- Aah!

102
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:40,390
Even when you know it
bends, you still think... whoa!

103
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,661
Please tell me you hid the jewel.

104
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,130
Of course I hid the jewel...

105
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,098
In a place where no one will ever find it.

106
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,534
Uh, excuse me. Where are you taking us?

107
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:53,237
The pirate king will decide your fate.

108
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,641
"I don't care what road we choose.

109
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:58,809
I'm Galavant.

110
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,898
- I get to eat the raisins."
- "I'm Isabella.

111
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,347
I chew with my mouth open like
a cow working on a fresh cud."

112
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,816
I have a deviated septum. I told you that.

113
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,451
I can't breathe through my nose.

114
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:09,753
If I chew with my mouth closed,
I'd get no air.

115
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:10,888
Do you want me to die?

116
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,224
Well...

117
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,761
Wait. What are pirates doing
miles from the ocean?

118
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,402
I'm... so sorry. Am I missing something?

119
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:26,737
Where's your boat?

120
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:30,540
I'll be asking the questions around here.

121
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,309
Arr!

122
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,277
Actually, go ahead.

123
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:35,679
I didn't have a question ready.

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,182
Um... don't you need a boat to be pirates?

125
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,951
You're on land.

126
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,820
- Land ho!
- Carl, stop it.

127
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,457
All you need to be a pirate
is a dark heart

128
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,227
and a wicked disregard
for other people's lives.

129
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,528
And swords.

130
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,531
Of course swords.
That goes without saying.

131
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,500
Everyone knows pirates need swords.

132
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,435
- What about a hook hand?
- Parrots? Peg legs.

133
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,738
- Land ho!
- I said stop it!

134
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,242

with nothing worth taking.

on the same page, isn't it?

254
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,902
It is nice to have a break

255
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:25,971
from the relentless stream
of criticism, yeah.

256
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:29,308
Maybe if you did things right,
I wouldn't have to say it.

257
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,709
- Mouth breather.
- Egomaniac.

258
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,277
And it's over.

259
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,348
You. Walk with me.

260
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,284
Oh, right. Of course.

261
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,530
Lads, could you give me a hand?

262
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,631
Arr.

263
00:11:56,335 --> 00:12:00,604
You know, we met before, at Lilith Faire,

264
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,841
the island of Lesbos.

265
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:06,344
I looked a little different...
Fewer wrinkles.

266
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:08,113
More like...

267
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,614
Yes, of course.

268
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,050
Well, you're Peter Pillager,
the pirate king.

269
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,753
Well, your men used to be
the scourge of the seas.

270
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:16,922
What happened there?

271
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,523
Oh.

272
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,393
You know how it is when you
spend too much time with people.

273
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:23,528
Little things start to get to you...

274
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,463
- Oh...
- And before you know it,

275
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,432
it's all about who's taken whose booty.

276
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,201
"It's my booty." "No, it's my booty."

277
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,769
booty, booty, booty.

278
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,305
- You stopped working together.
- Big-time.

279
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:37,008
We can't even agree on how to
get our ship off that damn hill.

280
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,313
The truth is...
I could do with a man like you.

281
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,583
So I have a proposition.

282
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:48,320
Either, "A," I kill all of you

283
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:51,356
and keep that jewel
and the girls' supplies.

284
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:56,294
- Why do you want the girls' supplies?
- Or "B," you join me and I let your squire

285
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,264
and that annoying little
mouth breather go.

286
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,700
Well, in all fairness to her,

287
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,035
only 'cause she's not here
to defend herself,

288
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:06,271
the mouth breathing
is a medical condition,

289
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:09,507
- so she can't really help it.
- Seems like a pretty simple fix to me.

290
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,476
Put food in mouth, close mouth, chew.

291
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,578
What kind of moron can't do that?

292
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:18,183
Again, not to get into semantics here,

293
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:21,286
but if she closes her mouth
while she eats,

294
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:24,589
she's literally not breathing
out of anywhere.

295
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,757
You get used to it.

296
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:28,860
Honestly, lately, I can't fall asleep
until she starts snoring.

297
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,162
Dude, you're making me uncomfortable.

298
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:33,565
Who are you choosing,
me or the mouth breather?

299
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,001
Call her a "mouth breather" one more time.

300
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:39,237
Mouth breather.

301
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,706
How did you do that?

302
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:43,641
I keep trying to tell everyone...

303
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:44,809
Oh.

304
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,345
I'm not just the guy
that eats the raisins.

305
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,050
Excuse me, excuse me.

306
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,986
Chef coming through. Thank you.
This way, my lady.

307
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,788
Here's your table, My Queen.

308
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,757
What fresh idiocy does king
Richard have in store for me now?

309
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,392
Um, I'm...

310
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:03,361
That was rhetorical. Shoo.

311
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:06,297
Chef out.

312
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,467
Welcome to the show!

313
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:12,437
I introduce to you, without further ado,

314
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:13,905
the king of comedy!

315
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:17,222
Hello! Thank you very, very, very much.

316
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,177
Now, I understand you've all come here

317
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,113
under threat of death,
and I appreciate it.

318
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,649
In fact... I ordered it.

319
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:29,320
Everybody laugh!

320
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,581
What on God's flat earth is going on?

321
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,193
Well, they say the way to a woman's heart

322
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:38,183
- is through her funny bone, so...
- Oh, God. Let's not do this.

323
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,132
Why did the king go to the dentist?

324
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,533
To get his teeth crowned.

325
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,691
To get his teeth crowned.
Uh, you've heard that one.

326
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,004
Mm! "You might be a peasant" jokes.

327
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:51,275
If you have more children than teeth,

328
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:53,911
you might be a peasant.

329
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,783
Is this thing on?

330
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:02,219
Ugh. He's dying out there.
Give him the pie.

331
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,721
Now?!

332
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,523
That's the big finale.

333
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:07,692
Damn it, man, look at the poor bastard.

334
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,160
Give him the pie.

335
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:15,488
If your toilet is a tree,
then you might be...

336
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,342
She laughed! It worked! She laughed!

337
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:28,846
Quick, give me more pies so I can
keep hitting Gareth in the face.

338
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:32,277
Or someone else. I-I can pie someone else.

339
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:35,448
You're a fool.

340
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,116
When my men see me captive,

341
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:39,618
they will swarm on you like hornets.

342
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:40,953
No. Bees.

343
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:42,121
No, hornets was better.

344
00:15:42,122 --> 00:15:43,622
Well, you can let them try,

345
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:46,386
but I'll be damned if I'm letting my team
end up like yours.

346
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:49,628
So I'm gonna rescue them,
rouse us to work together,

347
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,831
defeat your... hold on.

348
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,501
Oh, for the love of Mike, what happened?

349
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,835
Sid was right.

350
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,171
It was time to stop bickering
and work together.

351
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,673
So we did, and we overthrew the camp.

352
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:04,410
You missed an amazing battle,
better than anything at castle black.

353
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:07,179
Well, FYI, I was also gonna come back,

354
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,448
and I was gonna suggest that
we start working together, too,

355
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:10,849
- wasn't I? Tell them.
- Oh, please, stop.

356
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,484
This whole time, I've been
saying that I was gonna...

357
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,455
- This is all a little humiliating.
- You know what? Doesn't matter.

358
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,023
I know we've been
driving each other crazy,

359
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:20,092
but I think we've got something
really good going on here.

360
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,195
I mean, look at us...
We're gorgeous, very diverse.

361
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:27,665
I think if we pull it together, we could
do something great, legendary even.

362
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,335
What do you say?

363
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,703
We are diverse.

364
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,174
Super diverse.

365
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:37,843
I remember when we had something special.

366
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:39,611
Arr.

367
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:40,972
I miss us.

368
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,616
Now, look, either we can take
your pirate supplies...

369
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,385
The swords, the hooks...

370
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:47,386
- Parrots.
- Booty.

371
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:48,854
- Peg legs.
- Girls' supplies.

372
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:51,356
Yes, yes, all of it,
or we can work together

373
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:56,028
to get your ship off that hill
and you can take us to Valencia.

374
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,062
What do you say?

375
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:06,338
Did I just cut your hand?

376
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,707
Yes. Very badly.

377
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,509
Sorry.

378
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,749
Where are you going?

379
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,584
It's time for 4:00 fool-around.

380
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:20,660
Is it?

381
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:23,922
M-my sundial must be slow
because of the... c-clouds.

382
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,591
If you're worried I'm upset
about you helping my husband

383
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,827
with that ridiculous show, then don't be.

384
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,997
Who cares? He's an idiot.

385
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,598
Yes, well, that's the thing.

386
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,233
I don't think I can do this anymore.

387
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:39,938
I guess I just feel a little... guilty.

388
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,606
Well, that's very noble of you

389
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,875
to care about someone's feelings.

390
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,839
Guards!

391
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:48,511
If you're developing a conscience,
then you're no good to me.

392
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:50,949
Take him to the dungeon,
the really scary one.

393
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,117
With the mice.

394
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,284
Wait, no! Please!

395
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:54,953
At least let me change my clothes!

396
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:57,455
These are gang colors!

397
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,958
Oh, hello.

398
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,226
I was just coming to see Steve.

399
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,727
Who's Steve?

400
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,363
Steve McKinzie. The jester.

401
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,932
You don't know his name?

402
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,567
Well, no matter.

403
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:13,738
Say, what do you call
a tiny mosquito in a tin suit?

404
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,573
- Oh, God.
- Nope.

405
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,575
A<i> gnat</i> in shining armor.

406
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,645
- I've got so many of these.
- Please stop talking.

407
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,247
No, I love talking with you.

408
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,582
Right, you maggots!

409
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,485
Let's get this boat off the hill.

410
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,787
What?

411
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,790
It's just nice to hear you
call us "maggots" again.

412
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,627
You've always been maggots in here.

413
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,595
Arr!

414
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,497

Gal...

431
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,952
Can I call you "Gal"?

432
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:36,487
Uh, well, I don't love it.

433
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:39,323
I have to talk to you.

434
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:40,858
I feel a little guilty about something.

435
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,127

436
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,496

Listen, Galavant,

444
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,349
I think the reason
I've been so difficult recently

445
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,019
is that I was villainizing you
so I felt better about myself.

446
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,190
I'm probably signing my parents' death
warrant by telling you this, but...

447

Sorry.

I don't always listen when you talk.

00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,922
and the last thing I think of in the eve.

86
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,157
And you can offer her great fame,

87
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,526
and you can offer her great fortune,

88
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,328
but...

89
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,832

90
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,167
great love.

91
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,170
And that is what she chooses.

92
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,008
Actually...

93
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,510
Hmm?

94
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:42,014
I don't know. I've been thinking a lot
about it ever since he kidnapped me, and...

95
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:44,352
I'm gonna go with the fame and fortune.

96
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:46,454

- Seems like an easier life, you know?

Oh, I'm really sorry, Gal.
I hope we can be friends.

98

99

- Mm.

00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,175

103
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,711
Would you just do that for me, please?

104
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:12,494
Night-night.

105
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,806

106
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,275
I see we're getting an
early start this morning.

107
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,963
Oh, what do you want, Sid?

108
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:29,966
Sir... when you hired me to be your squire,

109
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:33,794
it was the most exciting
thing to ever happen to me.

110
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,898
Best squireship in the land.

111
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,739
My parents completely plotzed.

112
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:39,875
But ever since Madalena...

113
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:42,344
- Don't say her name.
- Right.

114
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,080
There's someone here to see you.

115
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,147
She brings with her an opportunity.

116
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,950
I would beg you to meet with her.

117
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,786
- Sid, I'm not seeing anyone.
- And here she is... may I present

118
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:54,256
the Princess Isabella
Maria Lucia "Elisabeeta"...

119
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:58,160
- "Betta."
- ... Betta of Valencia.

120
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,195
Well, that's a mouthful.

121
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:02,097
Uh-huh.

122
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:07,202
Sir Galavant,

123
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,871
I have traveled long and
far to seek your favor.

124
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:12,207
Four months ago, my peaceful
kingdom of Valencia...

125
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,508
I'm sorry. What is that smell?

126
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,844
That would be me.

127
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:16,912
Four months ago,

128
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:19,882
my peaceful kingdom of Valencia
fell under attack from a rival land.

129
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:22,684
My people were taken captive.

130
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:25,387
My entire family either
killed or imprisoned.

131
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,889
Oh, that's terrible. That's just terrible.

132
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,691
Still, you've got a nice way about you.

133
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:31,293
I'm sure you'll land on your feet.

134
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,961
Nice meeting you. Door's on the wall.

135
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:40,168
Before being captured, my
father hid me in the cellar

136
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,004
and handed me the
priceless Jewel of Valencia.

137
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,506
I hid in that cellar for months

138
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:46,841
as my family was slaughtered above me.

139
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:49,711
I now offer you this priceless jewel,

140
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:53,081
all that my country has left to offer.

141
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:56,651
I throw myself at your mercy, Sir Galavant!

142
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,820

Another wonderful routine, Jester.

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,353
I'm not seeing it, baby.

Perhaps his humor flies

know what she sees in him.

00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,434
No idea, My King.

186
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,437
Well, I will go and compliment the Jester.

187
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,940
And while I do, husband,

188
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,776
perhaps you can make some progress
convincing the king and queen of Valencia

189
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:06,046
- to tell you where their jewel is hidden.
- I've tried everything.

00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,448
Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,275
Galavant would not stand for this.

192
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,986
- What did you just say?
- I said,

193
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:17,791
"Galavant would not have stood for this"!

194
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,626
See, that's what I thought you said.

195
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:22,129
I just wanted clarification. Thank you.

196
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,299
Find me the jewel, would you, dear?

197
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,634
Of course, darling.

198
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,137
Jester, um...

199
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:32,573
Join me in my chamber, would you?

200
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:38,165
I'd love to learn a little more
about how you, uh... craft a joke.

201
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,415
Ooh!

202
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,351
She really gets a kick
out of that damn Jester.

203
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,687
I don't know. Maybe it
is all going over my head.

204
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:49,022
Oh, it's definitely
going over your head, sir.

205
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,106
A midday snack, My King?

206
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,708
Come up here.

207
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,882
What happened to the other chef?

208
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,920
Looked just like you,
but... older, more wrinkly.

209
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,121
My father?

210
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,956
Right. What happened to him?

211
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,358
- You had him killed, sir.
- Hmm?

212
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,893
Your mutton was too rare.

213
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,062
Well, that doesn't sound like me.

214
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,064
You killed his father before him.

215
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,567
Your family has killed
the last four generations

216
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,902
of chefs in my family.

217
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,371
It's not a great job, My King.

218
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,041
I'm such a bully.

219
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,510
I'm under a terrible amount of
pressure. You have to understand that.

220
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,111
Oh, it's fine, My King.
Don't worry about it.

221
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,414
Oh, Gareth, I try so hard to please her.

00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,416

and I would very much like you to fix it.

287
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,071
Two months ago, you were
imprisoned in a cellar.

288
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,239
Then what happened?

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,074
Ah, here we are.

290
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,809

291
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,244
I believe you know where to stand.

292
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,782
Now, let me ask you one question.
I've tried to be kind to you.

293
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,250
Have I not?

294
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,685
You pillaged our peaceful
kingdom, killed half our army.

295
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:15,753
But I haven't killed you.

296
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,555
I mean, think about it.

297
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,056
I've killed a massive
amount of people this week,

298
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,759
but I haven't killed... kil...

299
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,128
Gareth, I have a horribly scratchy throat.

300
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,129
A bit of tea, please.

301
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,297
Tea for the king!

302
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,498
I'm not really a yeller.

303
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,700
I've been fighting a
bug since the invasion.

304
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,702
I swear, it's the plague.
It's not the plague.

305
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,538
- Feel it, though... does that feel lumpy?
- No.

306
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,707
- You didn't even feel it.
- We beg you to show mercy to our people,

307
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,710
- good King Richard.
- We've done this.

308
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,546
Look, here's the thing.

309
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,883
My wife really wants that jewel of yours.

310
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,387
Now, I know, at times, she
can come off as a bit, um...

311
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,155
What's the word?

312
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,323
- Evil.
- Cruel.

313
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,447
No, that's not it. It's more...

314
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,673
- Sadistic.
- Vicious.

315
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,494
You know, I think you really
just have to get to know her.

316
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,795
She can be a

317
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,130
- Would you stop it, Gareth?!
- All right.

318
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,965
How's about this?

319
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,067
You tell me where the jewelry is,

320
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,275
we'll pack up shop.

321
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,103
We'll stop the pillaging and the killing,

322
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,272
yada, yada, and everyone's happy.

323
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,107
The Jewel of Valencia is priceless.

324
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,208
I know. I know.

325
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,377
It is a symbol of Valencia.
It has belonged not to us,

326
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,113
but to our people for thousands of years.

327
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,782
Totally understand. Totally empathize.

328
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,617
- Can I have it?
- Never!

329
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,789
This is so not how I wanted to do this!

330
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,558
It is about to get very messy in here.

331
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,294
Ooh, my tea! Thank you very much.

332
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,631
Mm.

333
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,600
Is there lemon in there?

334
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,769
Yes... My King?

335
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,706
Some unsqueezed lemons.

336
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,376
Well, it's delightful. Just delightful.

337
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,045
Kill the king, make her watch.

338
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,547
No!

339
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,252
Mmm.

340
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:56,754
Mmm.

341
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,256
Sid, fetch me a drink.

342
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,260
When he tells me to fetch,
those are my favorite moments.

343
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,664
Thanks again for the drink.

344
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,765
Drinks.

345
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,133
Right. Thanks again.

346
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,271
My father used to tell stories of you,

347
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,507
- of your skill in battle... 
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

348
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,704
Your heroism, of your goodness.

349
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,780
What happened to you?

350
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,915
I mean... eh.

351
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,286
Oh, come on. I've come a long way.

352
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,789
Surely I deserve some kind of backstory.

353
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,196
All right.

354
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:42,533
My parents were people of
massive, massive appetites.

355
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,035
They loved everything... they
loved food. They loved drink.

356
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,304
But most of all, they loved each other.

357
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,140
Ironically, they also hated each other.

358
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:53,143
And they fought violently every day.

359
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,512
Didn't have time for much else, in fact.

360
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,515
So... at the age of 8, I swore off love.

361
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,319
Devoted myself to doing
something better with my life

362
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,488
than wasting it on love.

363
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,824
So I read, I trained, I learned languages.

364
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,826
All the time other young men
chasing spent chasing girls,

365
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,704
I spent that time bettering myself.

366
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,866
But I come from a long family of lovers.

367
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,368
You can't fight genetics.

368
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,505
So when it inevitably happened...

369
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,506
- When I fell... 
- You fell hard.

370
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,808
I fell hard.

371
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:25,976
And her?

372
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,013
She fell softer...

373
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,082
As it turns out.

374
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,588
Look, I'd love to help. Really, I would.

375
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,090
But I'm...

376
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,359
I'm sort of out of the whole
"damsel in distress" business

377
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,827
at the moment, so...

378
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,563
I listened from below as he
ordered my parents to their death.

379
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,365
And after coming all this way,

380
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,367
your advice is for me
to just turn a blind eye

381
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,536
and watch king Richard destroy my kingdom

382
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,538
and everyone I've ever loved?

383
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,113
What?

384
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,577
Did you just say...

385
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,145
"King Richard"?

386
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:05,343
Oh, come here!

387
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:06,849
- Isabella.
- Father!

388
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:09,514
Ah!

389
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,779
Maybe this is what we're looking for.

390
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,754
Ooh, sweet!

391
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:18,089
Any luck on the Jewel, Richard?

392
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,824
Well, actually, my dear...

393
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,793
I know. I know. You're working on it.

394
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,594
Well, why don't you stop working on it,

395
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:28,099
start acting like Galavant,
and do something already?

396
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,277
Will do, My Queen.

397
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:39,177
I swear, if I have to hear the
name Galavant one more time.

398
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:42,180
If only there was some way that I could...

399
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,248
Ah.

400
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,716
She's a pretty young
thing, isn't she, Gareth?

401
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,755
- A bit plump for my liking.
- Plump?

402
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,354
The girl is 100 pounds soaking wet.

403
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:54,365
I know, but I like skinny.
Like, really unhealthy skinny.

404
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,296
You love your parents, don't you, my dear?

405
00:18:58,297 --> 00:18:59,730
Leave my parents be.

406
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:02,366
Leave them be, or so help
me, I will kill you myself.

407
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,634
And spunky.

408
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,036
Ha! More like "chunky"!

409
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,070
Just stop it, Gareth!

410
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,105
I am trying to do something here!

411
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,441
Fine. If we can't beat
Galavant on his turf,

412
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,143
we'll bring him to our own.

413
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:13,978
If you want your parents to live,

414
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,646
you will travel to find Galavant.

415
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:19,650
You tell him that I, king
Richard, have invaded your kingdom.

416
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,652
Offer to pay him with the jewel.

417
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:26,657
When that doesn't work, I
want you to tell him this...

418
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,292
I feel like you should
be writing this down.

419
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:30,629
- I will remember it.
- It's a bit long.

420
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,933
I'd really just be more
comfortable if you wrote it down.

421
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,261
- I will remember it.
- Like a steel trap.

422
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,238
- Always had a wonderful memory, this one.
- Fine.

423
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,337
You tell him that king Richard is a...

424
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:42,506
Is a cruel and vicious man.

425
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,408
Four months I hid in that cellar.

426
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,410
He and his queen slept right above me.

427
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:49,747
And you tell him that every night,

428
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,080
you would listen while he
screamed at his queen...

429
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:54,418
Screamed at his queen, and
each night I would be left

430
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,987
with only the sobs of that poor woman.

431
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,491
Every night, she would cry
out, "I made the wrong choice.

432
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm so sorry, Gals. I'm so sorry."

433
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,710
She must have left some maidens back home.

434
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,312
Never knew what she meant.

435
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:10,215
"I'm so sorry, Gals."

436
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,605
I love you, Gal.

437
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,107
"I'm so sorry, Gal."

438
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:20,802
She was saying, "I'm so sorry, Gal."

439
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,282
We leave tomorrow at sunrise.

440
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:29,019
