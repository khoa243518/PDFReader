1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,596
It was May of 2006 in New York City

2
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:18,119
and life was good.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,334
But everything was about to change.

4
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:24,349
So... what do you think?

5
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,457
Robin again?

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:33,085
Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together.

7
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,250
Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.

8
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,611
But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?

9
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:45,295
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills.

10
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:47,551
Anybody else get chills?

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,460
Look, I realize we've been down this road before,

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,063
but the fact is, whatever I do,

13
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:56,927
it all keeps coming back to Robin, so...

14
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,703
I gotta do this.

15
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,840
Ow! What the hell?

16
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:04,321
That wasn't me. That was the universe.

17
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:10,000
The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something--

18
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,401
a storm.

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,442
And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday.

20
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,171
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.

21
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,150
So don't step in a poodle.

22
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,583
Sandy? Robin?

23
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,750
Thanks, Lou.

24
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:26,851
Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.

25
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

26
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,651
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

27
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,872
And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.

28
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,380
Have a great night.

29
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,300
And, we're clear.

30
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:41,480
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.

31
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:44,533
Well, I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again,

32
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,523
but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.

33
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:50,683
Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight.

34
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:53,770
The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end

35
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:56,051
really got my freak juice flowing.

36
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,161
Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash

37
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,091
and burn before you say, "enough"?

38
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,110
One more. One more time.

39
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,582
One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture.

40
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:09,382
And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it.

41
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:10,793
If it's yes, great.

42
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,131
If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.

43
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:17,630
So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?

44
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,873
I am going to make her...

45
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,621
a mix CD.

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,340
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

47
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,262
Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.

48
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,892
I see where this is going.

49
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,710
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work...

50
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,082
usually.

51
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,220
The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999.

52
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:40,953
The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...

53
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,771
Universe.

54
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,990
So, this plan you speak of?

55
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,792
Remember the first night Robin and I went out?

56
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:52,470
I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.

57
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,971
Yeah. Dude, that was awesome,

58
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:57,261
but how are you ever going to top that?

59
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,753
She should be here any second.

60
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,411
Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?

61
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,703
Enough with the-- we'll go get pizza later, all right?

62
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,141
Just...

63
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:26,852
Damn it.

64
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:33,850
Hello.

65
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:38,242
Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.

66
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,121
Extra key?

67
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,351
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

68
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,733
Yes, I gave it to you.

69
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,641
Oh, right. That key.

70
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,252
Yeah, I lost it.

71
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,520
Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.

72
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:52,621
No, wait, uh...

73
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,682
Maybe you should just knock.

74
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,081
Knock?

75
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,641
Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.

76
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:08,683
Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco.

77
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,531
I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship.

78
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,691
We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.

79
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,182
Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?

80
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,831
Summer fellowship?

81
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,581
Just knock.

82
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,983
Okay.

83
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,101
Hi.

84
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,310
Hi.

85
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,563
Robin...

86
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:47,982
I've sort of said this already.

87
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:51,962
I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly.

88
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,992
So this is me, just saying it.

89
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,972
With strings.

90
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,552
I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together.

91
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,532
What do you say?

92
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,651
- What do you say?
- Yes.

93
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:15,881
No.

94
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,461
I don't know.

95
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,143
Those are the three options.

96
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,212
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

97
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:26,912
I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and...

98
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,832
I have to pee.

99
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:34,290
Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.

101
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:49,933
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.

102
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,740
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

103
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:57,781
Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.

104
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,112
Sure.

105
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,281
We're not getting any pizza.

106
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:07,881
Okay. Let's talk.

107
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,222
Okay.

108
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,611
Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?

109
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,791
Thanks, guys. Just need a minute.

110
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,140
Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though.

111
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,872
Kind of an inside joke.

112
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,220
Thanks.

113
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:29,182
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.

114
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,643
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

115
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,991
You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay?

116
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,201
We only just started being friends again.

117
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:39,001
I know. But-- come on.

118
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,691
And we want different things.

119
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,071
That's still there. That's not going away.

120
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,322
I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out

121
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,560
and I'd lose you as a friend?

122
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,291
I gotta think about this.

123
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,701
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

124
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,783
Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious.

125
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,282
I'm kidding. I'm serious.

126
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:57,732
I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.

127
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,060
I thought that thing was canceled.

128
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,110
Well, it's back on.

129
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,022
Since when?

130
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,842
Since like an hour ago.

131
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,441
..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic.

132
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:09,670
So it's blue skies this weekend.

133
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,092
Sandy? Robin?

134
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:16,500
Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud.

135
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:21,261
I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One.

136
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:23,750
It has been an honor to bring you the news each night,

137
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,332
and read the paper to you each morning.

138
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,432
I will always treasure it.

139
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,043
Good night, New York.

140
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,871
And we're clear.

141
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,270
You're leaving?

142
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,622
There. I quit my job.

143
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:39,192
We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me?

144
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,973
Oh, congratulations.

146
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,956
Congratulations yourself.

147
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:46,952
What do you mean?

148
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:51,410
Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor.

149
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:53,222
I told him you.

150
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,661
They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.

151
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,240
Wow.

152
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,170
Thanks.

153
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,611
And, yes.

154
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,812
Yes, what?

155
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,781
Yes, let's go get dinner.

156
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:09,373
How about this weekend on the camping trip?

157
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,500
I roast a mean weenie.

158
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,222
Oh, you're kidding me.

159
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,142
No way. Don't go on this thing.

160
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,830
Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.

161
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,491
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date.

162
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,192
With Sandy... and his weenie.

163
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,500
I mean is this not a date?

164
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,291
I don't-I don't know.

165
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,980
So, what? You actually like this guy now?

166
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,572
I don't know.

167
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,752
Are you gonna hook up with him?

168
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:35,722
I don't know.

169
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,843
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

170
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,853
And you know what? That's okay.

171
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,813
I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.

172
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,372
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really? What is all of this?

173
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:50,162
I mean, why can't you just say, "Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"

174
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:55,143
No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates

175
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,871
and let's spend the rest of our lives together.

176
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,732
Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point?

177
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,930
God, you are so terrified of anything real.

178
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,873
It's like you're floating out in space.

179
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,852
Touch the ground, Robin.

180
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,821
Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.

181
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,803
I need to think about this.

182
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,130
Fine.

183
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,323
No, I'm sorry, I...

184
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,171
I can't do this anymore.

185
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:19,840
I need an answer.

186
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:25,413
If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.

187
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,383
Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.

188
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,492
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

189
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,693
Nice try, buddy.

190
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,841
Good hustle out there.

191
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,013
Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure.

192
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:47,092
She's made her choice and you can finally move on.

193
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,881
Screw that. This ain't over.

194
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:53,452
Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...

195
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,513
I don't care what I said.

196
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:58,422
This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be.

197
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,420
It is meant to be, and you know why?

198
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,650
'Cause I mean it to be.

199
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,910
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

200
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,531
Let's pause.

201
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:13,081
See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight

202
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,842
they could pause and take a break.

203
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,072
Their fights often lasted for days.

204
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,291
- A painting fellowship?
- I was never going to take it.

205
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,143
- In California?
- I was never going to take it.

206
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:25,102
Ted, she is going on that camping trip.

207
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:30,380
Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.

208
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,572
Fine.

209
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:35,443
If an act of God is what it takes,

210
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,683
then an act of God it is.

211
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,553
What are you talking about?

212
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,142
I'm gonna make it rain.

213
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,031
I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

214
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,531
So how do I keep that from happening?

215
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,973
Simple-- I make it rain!

216
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,973
Ted, do you want me to slap you again?

217
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:59,103
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

218
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,991
Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what?

219
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,741
I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan.

220
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,513
That girl you used to go out with, Penelope,

221
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,061
wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?

222
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:08,822
Yeah.

223
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:09,931
Are you still in touch with her?

224
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,152
Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex,

225
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:14,571
we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up,

226
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,373
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

227
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,572
Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her.

228
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,392
She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.

229
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,571
- Did you just say a "rain dance"?
- Yes.

230
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:28,201
- A rain dance.
- Yes.

231
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:31,982
- A dance to make it rain.
- Yes.

232
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,073
- We're finding Penelope!
- No, we are not!

233
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,032
Yes, we are!

234
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:46,581
Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!

235
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:49,423
Why the hell should I help you?

236
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:54,741
Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.

237
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:58,023
We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me.

238
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,453
How is that a relationship?

239
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:01,951
Twice!

240
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:05,170
- Barney, there is no way...
- Shh!

241
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:07,160
Seriously, come on.

242
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,393
Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.

243
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,770
Why?

244
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:14,560
There's this girl...

245
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,323
"There's this girl."

246
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:20,393
You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature.

247
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:25,473
I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.

248
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:27,102
Penelope, this is the girl I love.

249
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:30,273
If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.

250
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,802
Please.

251
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:36,740
This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?

252
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,722
Absolutely.

253
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,181
- Kind of like Barney?
- Kind of.

254
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,951
- Hey.
- You hit on my mom!

255
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,803
We weren't exclusive!

256
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:45,963
I'm in.

257
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,803
And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.

258
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:49,973
Okay.

259
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:52,571
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.

260
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,610
Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.

261
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,482
I will throw you off this roof.

262
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,610
There's so much of your mom in you.

263
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:06,041
And she's been throwing up ever since.

264
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:08,683
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?

265
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:12,250
Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about?

266
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,183
Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment

267
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,670
with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...

268
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,540
Oh, that's so sweet.

269
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy?

270
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:28,811
I mean, a string quartet in my living room-- who does that?

271
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,113
Nobody does that.

272
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,262
Exactly.

273
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,410
No, honey-- nobody does that.

274
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,521
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

275
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,121
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.

276
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,053
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?

277
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,833
Forbid? Who said forbid?

278
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:50,983
I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months,

279
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:52,872
and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day.

280
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:55,530
Look for me-- I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.

281
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,241
Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.

282
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:03,092
Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them.

283
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.

284
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:12,401
So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it" to "I need to do this"?

285
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,450
Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?

286
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,350
Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.

287
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,332
I never said that!

288
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:19,962
You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now,

289
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,431
what's gonna change in three months?

290
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:22,741
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.

291
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,152
Maybe not.

292
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:28,130
- Pause.
- Pause.

293
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,523
- So, are you just, like, starving?
- Totally.

294
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,860
Red Lobster?

295
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:37,122
Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!

296
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,661
Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it.

297
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:43,141
Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.

298
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,922
I wouldn't dare.

299
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,380
Marshall, no. We're on pause.

300
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,830
There's no crying in Pauseland!

301
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,041
Pauseland is a magical place, with--

302
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,741
with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers!

303
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,093
Damn it!

304
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,641
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday,

305
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:04,170
happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday,

306
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,402
happy, happy...

307
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,652
Ted, this is funny.

308
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,720
Still funny.

309
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,720
Still fu... And now it's sad.

310
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:25,340
Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?

311
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,633
I think so.

312
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,461
Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?

313
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,100
I think so.

314
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:37,762
Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?

315
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,362
No.

316
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,171
No?

317
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,770
I've read extensively on the subject:

318
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,542
firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...

319
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,851
Have you ever seen a rain dance?

320
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,371
I've seen a film strip.

321
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,083
Terrific. Uh, look, I should run.

322
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R.

323
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,341
I can't believe this.

324
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,461
We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.

325
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,782
What do you mean "we," white man?

326
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,301
How did we get here?

327
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,323
Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was,

328
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,672
did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.

329
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,593
I think there's still one left.

330
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,222
Dibs.

331
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,361
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

332
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,511
Look... I know this sucks.

333
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,221
It's just something I'm going through.

334
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,763
I'm not asking you to understand it.

335
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,211
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

336
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,271
I'm just asking you to support it.

337
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,941
I want to, Lily, okay?

338
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:47,782
I really do.

339
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,841
But I just can't.

340
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:50,530
Why not?

341
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:53,463
Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not.

342
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,582
What if you decide to go be a painter

343
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,682
and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore,

344
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,891
and three months becomes forever?

345
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,571
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

346
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,921
Marshall...

347
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:06,081
'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now.

348
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:09,342
I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.

349
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,880
Marshall, I love you.

350
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,642
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

351
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,901
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

352
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,731
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!

353
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,760
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?!

354
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,433
That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.

355
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,630
Thank you.

356
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,491
Hey, Ted.

357
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,310
Whatcha doing?

358
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,973
A rain dance.

359
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:46,751
Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

360
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:50,090
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography.

361
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,953
It's the thought that counts.

362
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,741
She's leaving in half an hour.

363
00:17:56,755 --> 00:18:00,413
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl.

364
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,790
This isn't gonna work!

365
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,510
Yeah. I know that.

366
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,613
- Well, then why are you doing this?
- Because I love her.

367
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:07,980
I love her!

368
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,542
I told her that the first night we went out,

369
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,592
and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed.

370
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,661
So yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

371
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,700
But it has to work!

372
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,060
You hear me, universe?

373
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,812
This is Ted Mosby talking!

374
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,910
Give me some rain!

375
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,361
Come on!

376
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,151
Come on!

377
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,943
Come on...!

378
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,603
Oh, come on!

379
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:54,233
Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area

380
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:58,380
and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.

381
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,973
How about that? He did it.

382
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,812
Robin! Hey, Robin!

383
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,963
Oh, thank God you're here!

384
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,151
My camping trip got rained out.

385
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,960
I know. I'm sorry.

386
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,800
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

387
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,081
Come down here.

388
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,232
It's pouring. You come up.

389
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,412
No, you have to come down here.

390
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,931
- Why?
- Why?

391
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,163
Because I made it rain, that's what I did today!

392
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:55,582
And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!

393
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,641
I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.

394
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.

395
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:03,661
You have to come down here!

396
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,441
- I was gonna...
- I know.

397
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,900
And that's how Robin and I ended up together.

398
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:48,960
Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain.

399
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:52,192
As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same,

400
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:55,220
the people looked the same. It all looked the same.

401
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:56,742
But it wasn't.

402
00:20:56,746 --> 00:21:00,320
In just one night, everything had changed.

1
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,425
When you're single, and your friends start to get married,

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,367
every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation:

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,563
"Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"

4
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,533
What it's really asking is,

5
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,555
"Where do you see yourself in three months?

6
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:29,873
Sitting next to your girlfriend, or hitting on a bridesmaid?"

7
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:32,808
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,287
I was an optimist.

9
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,726
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?

10
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,326
Ted, have you ignored all my teachings?

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,682
For the most part, yeah.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,143
No, you don't bring a date to a wedding.

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,687
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.

14
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,529
Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted. No-- no date.

15
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:52,241
Deer carcass? Really? That's the metaphor you're going with here?

16
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,858
Ted, it's a simile.

17
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,180
Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date,

18
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,330
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,991
I got to bring someone, but who?

20
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,916
Of course, I knew who I wanted to bring.

21
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,594
Robin-- the big unanswered question in my life.

22
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:10,234
Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.

23
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:12,058
Derek.

24
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:15,792
Well, Derek and I just broke up.

25
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:18,317
Oh, no, that's terrible! Are you okay?

26
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,842
Yeah, do you need a drink or something?

27
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,666
Nah... We never really clicked.

28
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,668
I felt bad, though. He was pretty bummed.

29
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,143
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

30
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,692
He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.

31
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:31,508
He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.

32
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,926
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

33
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,815
I think I'll get that drink now.

34
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,989
Okay, guys, I got to say something.

35
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:43,594
I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.

36
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:48,345
Oh, please-- they were buried in a shallow grave.

37
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,496
Not again. Come on. Dude?

38
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:52,115
We all know how this movie ends.

39
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:56,542
Ted falls in love, love kicks Ted in the sprouts, roll credits.

40
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,240
No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture.

41
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,315
Fact:

42
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,683
Robin was into me when we first met.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,079
Fact:

44
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:07,420
Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof.

45
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:08,864
Fact:

46
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,518
On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.

47
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:12,639
Fact:

48
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,425
I need a date to this wedding.

49
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:15,577
Wish me luck.

50
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,229
What I don't get is why is Claudia marrying Stuart?

51
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,014
She's way hotter than him.

52
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,192
How way?

53
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,905
Way way.

54
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,812
This wedding does sound pretty amazing, though.

55
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:31,013
Fancy hotel ballroom,

56
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:32,708
everybody all dressed up...

57
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,491
Oh, here we go.

58
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:35,089
What?

59
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,045
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans

60
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,204
because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,691
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.

62
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:43,584
I thought so.

63
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,852
You know what? Excuse me if I don't want to get married

64
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:50,802
barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-One's-Going-To-Drive-That-Far.

65
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,021
Yes. I want a ballroom,

66
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,738
and I want a band, and I want shoes.

67
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:58,733
I've been dreaming about this day since I was, like...

68
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,398
A little girl?

69
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:01,913
What up!

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,866
Okay. I'm just saying that it's my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.

71
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,944
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.

72
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:11,302
Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.

73
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,389
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.

74
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,128
I mean, seriously-- Claudia and Stuart?

75
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,840
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness,

76
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,485
but, you know, I was drunk.

77
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,304
There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.

78
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:29,916
You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship

79
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,308
is to celebrate someone else's successful one.

80
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,951
Oh, it makes sense.

81
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,191
So, with that in mind, uh, our friends Claudia and Stuart

82
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,624
are having this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.

83
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,388
You want to be my plus one?

84
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,813
Ooh... "Plus one." You make it sound so romantic.

85
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:45,918
Fine.

86
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,033
You want to be my date?

87
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,713
Your date?

88
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:52,823
I'd love to.

89
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,225
How fancy are we talking about here?

90
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,977
Oh, you're going to want to bring your "A" game.

91
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,173
Oh, I'll bring it.

92
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,585
I'll bring it so hard, the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.

93
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,302
Lily? I need a dress.

94
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,138
You're going? That's awesome!

95
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,031
Oh, my God-- four days to find a dress?

96
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,704
I know, it's a suicide mission.

97
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:14,697
Well, if we leave now... we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it!

98
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:15,816
Bye, babe.

99
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,642
Whoa! Did you see how fired up she was?

100
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,236
I don't know, there's something there.

101
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,747
And, come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne...

102
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,504
Who  knows?

103
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,145
Wow. Ted, you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,

104
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,627
'cause I'm revoking your "dude" membership.

105
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,195
Yeah... how was that manicure yesterday?

106
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,427
Invigorating, thanks.

107
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,511
Okay, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,

108
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,205
but  back then I really thought that's how it worked.

109
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:50,334
You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting...

110
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,490
the stars line up...

111
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,961
and shazam.

112
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,951
I know now that life is never that simple.

113
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,090
Hey, Claudia!

114
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,753
Yes, I want Tahitian Vanilla! You wrote it down wrong?

115
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,296
No, no, no, no, listen to me--

116
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,936
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian Vanilla,

117
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,359
I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground!

118
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,258
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?

119
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:17,171
Yeah, good-bye.

120
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,746
Hey!

121
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,287
How's it going?

122
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,864
My wedding is in two days, that's how it's going.

123
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,418
Oh, don't worry, it's going to be great. I'm so excited.

124
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,311
Well, you should be-- lots of single girls.

125
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:34,098
Oh, well, yeah, I'm... bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.

126
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,941
What?

127
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm bringing a date.

128
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:37,700
You're not bringing a date.

129
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,420
Uh... yes, I am.

130
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,648
Uh, no, you're not.

131
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,635
I checked "plus one."

132
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:43,798
No, you didn't.

133
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,016
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...

134
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,763
Ted, you did not check "plus one"!

135
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,656
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

136
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,159
Wait, I've already invited someone.

137
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:56,883
You are not bringing a guest, Ted!

138
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,174
The guest list has been closed for months-- months!

139
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:01,877
But I checked "plus one"! I always check "plus one"!

140
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,139
You absolutely did not check "plus one"!

141
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,431
If you had checked "plus one," I would have called you to get the name of your guest,

142
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,029
so I could have the place cards printed up.

143
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,372
Did I call you to get the name of your guest?

144
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,292
Is there a place card with her name printed on it?

145
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,763
She doesn't need a place card. She knows her name.

146
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,307
What's she eating?! Huh?! You ordered the chicken. What did she order?

147
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:18,796
Do you see how your story is full of holes?

148
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:21,406
Come on, Claudia, we go way back.

149
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,392
Isn't there room for just one more person?

150
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,386
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.

151
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:29,281
I don't believe this! Claudia's crazy!

152
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,243
But, to be fair, she's also hot.

153
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,559
I totally checked "plus one." I'm sure I did.

154
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:34,845
- Yeah, right.
- I did!

155
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:37,259
Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why?

156
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,961
Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

157
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:44,783
See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down, you're single.

158
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,553
It's your default setting.

159
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,402
Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?

160
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,692
Oh, great, here comes the little Barney speech.

161
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:56,400
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?

162
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,624
- A little Barney...
- A little Barney.

163
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,656
A little Barney.

164
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,190
And you know what he said?

165
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:07,318
"Ted... you will bring no dates to this wedding.

166
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:12,199
You... will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."

167
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,999
Wow. Please stop.

168
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,447
I got to call Claudia. If I just explain to her...

169
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,332
Ted, no! Let it go.

170
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,792
She's about to get married, she's got enough to worry about.

171
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,143
Then what am I going to do?

172
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,686
The only thing you can do-- tell Robin she can't come.

173
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,982
Just a second!

174
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:34,953
- Hey!
- Hey. Listen...

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,819
Wait, two things. First of all... I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.

176
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:42,108
Totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging, just:

177
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,468
the theme of today is, "Ted rocks."

178
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,314
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

179
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,565
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no.

180
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,641
Thing number two: the dress.

181
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,205
We got a dress.

182
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,693
Go.

183
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,166
Well?

184
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:01,981
Did I bring it, or... did I bring it?

185
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,484
I think I brought it.

186
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,016
Wow.

187
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,217
That's what I was going for.

188
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,582
I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun.

189
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:13,407
Yeah, about that...

190
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,423
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

191
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,828
So? The dress?

192
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,843
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.

193
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:26,639
What?

194
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,929
I ran into Claudia, and she told me I didn't check "plus one" on the reply card.

195
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,675
- Why didn't you check "plus..."?
- I did check "plus one."

196
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,160
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.

197
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,531
-  And the dress!
- I know.

198
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,271
Okay, okay. Well, we'll sneak her in.

199
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,790
We can't sneak her in, we're not Ninjas.

200
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,271
- Oh, I wish we were Ninjas.
- I know.

201
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,521
You could always ask Stuart.

202
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,543
Can I do that?

203
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:50,515
Well,  sure.

204
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,850
You guys have been friends for a long time.

205
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,347
And it's 40% his wedding, too.

206
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,698
I don't know... it's going to be a tough sell.

207
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:00,696
Dude, no problem whatsoever.

208
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:01,414
Really?

209
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,147
Sure, the more, the merrier.

210
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,716
Wow! Wow, thanks for being so cool about this,

211
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,135
'cause you know, Claudia said...

212
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,748
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This morning at the rehearsal,

213
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:12,014
Claudia called our seven-year-old flower girl a whore.

214
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,995
So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.

215
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah, she's not usually like that.

216
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,809
No.

217
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,896
Well, thanks, Stu!

218
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,060
It's going to be a great wedding.

219
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,350
Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting

220
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,981
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.

221
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,859
Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods,

222
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,682
like a couple of squirrels.

223
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,421
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.

224
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,182
Like you could possibly know that.

225
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,142
I did it. I did it-- I'm taking her to the wedding.

226
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,034
Nice!

227
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:47,911
What? How?

228
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:49,138
I talked to Stuart.

229
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,633
You went around the bride.

230
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:54,258
"Oh, this hornets' nest looks harmless.

231
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,479
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.

232
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,532
Oh, look, some Gremlins. Let me go feed them after midnight!"

233
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,025
Did you know about this?

234
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,794
It may have been my idea.

235
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:05,272
What?

236
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,281
Stuart doesn't get a say?

237
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,514
Ah! So you admit it-- the groom should have an equal say.

238
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,033
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.

239
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,212
So I can invite whoever I want?

240
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,604
Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.

241
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:22,909
It's Claudia.

242
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,678
So it begins.

243
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,318
Come on, it can't be that bad.

244
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,584
Here, Lily, you answer it.

245
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:30,702
What? Why?

246
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,343
Because this whole thing was your idea.

247
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:33,556
And... Claudia scares me.

248
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,732
But... but you're the... But I just want to...

249
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:38,414
Ted's phone.

250
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,373
Oh, hi, Claudia.

251
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,186
What?

252
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,563
Now I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it went something like this...

253
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:48,665
Oh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him

254
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,407
he could bring his date to the wedding.

255
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,001
You what?

256
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,769
...always undermining me at every turn...

257
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,006
...try to show a little flexibility, but no!

258
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:04,489
It's all about you!

259
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,313
...and your mother...

260
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:13,739
You know what?

261
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,190
The wedding's off!

262
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,803
They broke up!

263
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:20,881
O w!

264
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,486
It's not because of me, is it?

265
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,374
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!

266
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,309
Oh, he's going to kill me!

267
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,188
And then he's gonna kill Ted!

268
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,242
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

269
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,407
It's Robin.

270
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:36,560
Answer it!

271
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:38,003
Uh, Lily's phone.

272
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:41,998
Ted, where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.

273
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh, Lily's busy.

274
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,187
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's going to love them.

275
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,468
That's great, I'll tell Lily to tell me.

276
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,692
Uh, listen, I really want to keep talking, um, but now's not a good time,

277
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,104
so I'm really excited about tomorrow, okay, bye.

278
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:56,733
Okay, bye.

279
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,797
Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this.

280
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,853
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus!

281
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:06,260
Okay, okay, sweetie, just calm down.

282
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:07,923
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

283
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,119
I want to go somewhere and drink!

284
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,073
Okay, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.

285
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,189
Oh, I feel terrible.

286
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:17,665
Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this.

287
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,460
Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia.

288
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,130
Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.

289
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,904
Um, tell Claudia I'm sorry.

290
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,120
Did she seem pissed at me?

291
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,781
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.

292
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,112
What say we get these crazy kids back together?

293
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,885
Hi, sad eyes.

294
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,807
What's got you down?

295
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:46,311
Stuart and I just broke up.

296
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:50,857
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's...

297
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,658
Two vodka cranberries, please.

298
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:56,254
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.

299
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,586
Remember?

300
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:00,283
When it comes to you, how can I forget?

301
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,780
They all drink vodka cranberries.

302
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:10,546
So... is there anything else you need... sweetie?

303
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,748
You got $400,000?

304
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:14,900
No.

305
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,052
But I do have a hug.

306
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,762
Thank you.

307
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,843
Stuart, I-I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...

308
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,632
Ted, for all I know, you did me the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.

309
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,457
Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.

310
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:37,876
No, I do-- this whole thing has made me realize I miss being single.

311
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:41,155
I miss staying out late, and making messes and not cleaning them up.

312
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,635
I miss owning porn.

313
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,309
Dude, who doesn't?

314
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:47,584
And you know, I'll see some super-hot model chick, and I'll think,

315
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,400
"Why am I with Claudia? I could be with her."

316
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,918
That's just crazy!

317
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,849
I mean... you're the luckiest... You and Claudia both...

318
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,450
The point is I want to get married. I want to settle down,

319
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,251
but right now, that's just not who I am.

320
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,336
I'm not a commitment guy; I'm a single guy.

321
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,023
Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other.

322
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,594
Everybody feels this way sometimes.

323
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,948
Relationships aren't easy; they're hard work.

324
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,524
It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap.

325
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,153
How would you know? You're not even married.

326
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:18,398
Okay, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily.

327
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,141
He's the pro-- this guy knows relationships.

328
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,230
Tell him, Marshall.

329
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,246
Stuart, don't get married.

330
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,365
- Dude...
- What?

331
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,521
Look, I'm sorry.

332
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:31,838
Being in a couple is hard. And committing, making sacrifices, it's hard.

333
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,633
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

334
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:37,262
Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life,

335
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,592
that should be the easiest thing in the world, and if it's not like that,

336
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,163
then she's not the one. I'm sorry.

337
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,079
You  know I don't have $400,000, right?

338
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,488
Maybe we got together too young.

339
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,021
Maybe that's what the problem was.

340
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,809
I mean, I'm 28 years old,

341
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:05,472
and I've really only ever been with one man.

342
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,548
That's just, that's...

343
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,562
Two more vodka cranberries, please!

344
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:17,999
Claudia... it's all gonna be okay.

345
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:22,038
Oh, thanks for listening, Barney.

346
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:24,484
It really means a lot to me.

347
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,289
Isn't it weird that we should... run into each other like this?

348
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:34,580
Two souls, of equal levels of attractiveness,

349
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:40,949
both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

350
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,974
- Oh, hell, no!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

351
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,991
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

352
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,422
and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her,

353
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,335
I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles,

354
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,956
and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out,

355
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,557
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes!

356
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,074
Wait, my eyes or my testicles?

357
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:04,448
One of each.

358
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,706
All right! All right!

359
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,000
Claudia?

360
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,114
Stuart.

361
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,324
I'm so sorry.

362
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,742
I'm so sorry, too.

363
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:13,828
I love you.

364
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,367
I love you too, babe.

365
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,209
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

366
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,259
And when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize I...

367
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:21,141
Marshall said what?!

368
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,115
It's more complicated than that!

369
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,669
He made me realize how much I love you.

370
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,427
These guys got us back together.

371
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,017
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

372
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:45,424
So where did we land on the whole plus one thing?

373
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,703
No, no, no, no!

374
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,931
It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia,

375
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:55,792
but, eventually, she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.

376
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,209
Still wow.

377
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,179
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.

378
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,342
Oh, yeah. I thought about leaving it at home,

379
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:08,805
but I figured I don't want to get there and realize I need it

380
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,759
and have to go all the way back to get it. So, yeah, I brought it.

381
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:14,946
Oh, sorry.

382
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,248
Hello?

383
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,507
Oh, my God. Tonight?

384
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,713
You're kidding.

385
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,748
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

386
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,391
Really?

387
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,902
Like anchor anchor?

388
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,309
What happened to Sandy?

389
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:34,707
Okay.

390
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,548
Okay. Sure. What time do you need me to...

391
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,851
Right now?! Oh.

392
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:41,991
Do it.

393
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,181
Do it.

394
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:52,206
Okay, I need like five minutes to change, and, um, I'll call you from the cab...

395
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,167
So admit it.

396
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:06,959
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

397
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:09,999
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.

398
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,209
The crab puffs were incredible.

399
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,999
We should totally have them at our wedding.

400
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,046
Definitely...

401
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,424
Hey. We just agreed on something.

402
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,234
Did we just start planning our wedding?

403
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,556
I think that we did.

404
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:26,566
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.

405
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:29,258
Ooh, I thought the red sauce was, like, awesome.

406
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:32,401
My God, were you born without taste buds?

407
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,593
What?

408
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,576
I love you.

409
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,137
Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls?

410
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,292
The answer may surprise you... after the break.

411
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,519
Man, you know something? Stuart's my new hero.

412
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,590
If that dude can bag a nine,

413
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,432
I got to be able to bag, like, a 16.

414
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,759
What's a 16?

415
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,766
Those two eights right over there.

416
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,693
Yeah.

417
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,904
Hi, Ted.

418
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:12,949
Claudia.

419
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,312
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.

420
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,603
Yeah, where is she?

421
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,479
Um... she couldn't make it.

422
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,562
What's so funny?

423
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,149
Oh, plan a wedding. You'll see.

424
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,885
Look at that.

425
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,797
That's how it's supposed to be. That right there.

426
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:39,943
Easy, simple.

427
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,601
It's just not like that with Robin.

428
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:48,732
It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.

429
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,241
Speaking of easy... bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.

430
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:56,496
By the way, I almost forgot.

431
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,173
We found this.

432
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,300
I didn't check "plus one."

433
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,827
You were right.

434
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,394
Of course, I was right.

435
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,315
I'm single.

436
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,935
Maybe that's just who I am.

437
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,254
And you know what? I like being single.

438
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,130
Being single's the best.

439
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,023
Yeah, stay out as late as you want.

440
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:19,946
Answer to no one.

441
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,550
The whole world full of endless possibilities.

442
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,863
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

443
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:32,087
Okay. Ah... doing some math here.

444
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,116
Table six has got three bridesmaids: an eight, an eight, and a seven.

445
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,307
I am willing to give you one of the eights, lowering myself to a 15,

446
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,556
which means you owe me...

447
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:48,765
So there we were, two single guys, doing our usual single-guy thing.

448
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:53,408
For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point,

449
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,869
that this was the night my life-- my real life-- would finally begin.

450
00:20:58,322 --> 00:20:59,785
The funny thing is...

451
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,760
I wasn't totally wrong.

452
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,961
Because that night was just beginning.

453

1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,002
Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story ;

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,263
the story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:10,551
Are we being punished for something ?

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,173
No.

5
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,059
Yeah, is this gonna take a while ?

6
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,950
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,083
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,796
It was way back in 2005.

9
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:27,584
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect

10
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:30,482
and living in New York  with Marshall,  my best friend from college.

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:31,708
My life was good.

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,508
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,112
Will you marry me ?

14
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:38,937
Yes. Perfect !

15
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,008
And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:41,756
You drink a toast.

17
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,593
You have sex on the kitchen floor.

18
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:45,406
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

19
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,110
Got it.

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,585
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

21
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,906
Dude, are you kidding ?
It's you and Lilly.

22
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,378
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lilly :

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,838
night you met, your first date, other first things.

24
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:59,642
Yeah, sorry.
We thought you were asleep.

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,699
It's physics, Marshall.

26
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,445
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.

27
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,027
My God.

28
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,762
You're getting engaged tonight.

29
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:12,260
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight ?

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,168
What was I doing ?

31
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,741
Here Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.

32
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,611
And me ?

33
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,572
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.

34
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,858
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls ?

35
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,965
Well, now I've got a new favorite... Lebanese girls.

36
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,148
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

37
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,111
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight ?

38
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,218
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes. And suit up !

39
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:40,213
Where's your suit ?

40
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,841
Just once, when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.

41
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,594
I did that one time.

42
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,747
It was a blazer !

43
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,014
You know, ever since college it's been, Marshall and Lilly and me.

44
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,855
Now, it's gonna be Marshall and Lilly... and me.

45
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,508
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:01:55,508 --> 00:02:00,124
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.

47
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,545
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,871
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met ?

49
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,498
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

50
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,098
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:14,460
Oh, right. Right.

52
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Lesson one : lose the goatee.

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,618
It doesn't go with your suit.

54
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:20,311
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two : get a suit.

55
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,127
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "A."

56
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:27,140
Lesson three : don't even think about getting married till you're 30.

57
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,410
30. Right. You're right.

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,224
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged,

59
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,478
you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,151
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,469
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,486
You're my best friend, Barney.

63
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,354
Good. Then, as your best friend,

64
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,163
I suggest we play a little game I like to call

65
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,235
- "Have you met Ted ?"
- Wait. No, no, no.

66
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,337
We're not playing "Have you met Ted ?"

67
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,739
Hi, have you met Ted ?

68
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,817
Hi, I'm Ted.

69
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,701
Yasmine.

70
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,972
That's a very pretty name.

71
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,779
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

72
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,397
I'm exhausted.

73
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,024
It was finger-painting day at school,

74
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:05,731
and a five year-old boy got to second base with me.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,690
Wow ! You're cooking ?

76
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,346
Yes, I am.

77
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:11,447
Aw...

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,996
Are you sure that's a good idea ?

79
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,078
After last time, you looked really creepy without eyebrows.

80
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:18,431
I can handle this.

81
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,697
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.

82
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,018
So, there's more surprises ?
Like what ?

83
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,064
Marshall was in his second year of law school,

84
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,435
so he was pretty good  at thinking on his feet.

85
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,731
Boogedyboo !

86
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,481
And that's all of 'em.

87
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,033
I'm gonna go... cook.

88
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,437
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

89
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:38,611
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.

90
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,190
So, do you think you'll ever get married ?

91
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,041
Well, maybe eventually...

92
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,150
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.

93
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,757
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

94
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,842
Band, no DJ.
People will dance !

95
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:51,517
I'm not gonna worry about it !

96
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,857
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged ?

97
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,773
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh ?

98
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,279
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

99
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,129
One more for the lady !

100
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,783
Oh, hey, look what I got.

101
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,597
Oh, honey ! Champagne.

102
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,638
Yeah.

103
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,910
No. You are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,550
- I'm not scared.
- Then open it.

105
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,591
Fine.

106
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,342
Please open it ?

107
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,554
You are unbelievable, Marshall.

108
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:31,062
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.

109
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,764
One, you plan out for months.

110
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,604
The other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.

111
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:36,934
Will you marry me ?

112
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,284
You wanna go out sometime ?

113
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,856
Of course, you idiot !

114
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,495
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

115
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,024
'Sup, Carl ?

116
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,142
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

117
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,759
Did you know there's a Pop Tart under your fridge ?

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,347
No, but dibs.

119
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,882
Where's that champagne ?

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,876
I wanna drink a toast with my fiance.

121
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,574
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

122
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,496
It's pretty easy, right ?

123
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,640
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden ?

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,910
This is crazy.
I'm not ready to settle down.

125
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,340
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl ?

126
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,431
The plan has always been don't even think about it until you're 30.

127
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,567
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

128
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:29,002
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

129
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,068
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...

130
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,544
but if I was, it's, like, "Okay, I'm ready. Where is she ?"

131
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,486
And there she was.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,041
It was like something from an old movie,

133
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,278
where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor,

134
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,091
turns to his buddy and says, "See that girl ?

135
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,139
I'm gonna marry her someday."

136
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,941
Hey, Barney, see that girl ?

137
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,721
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

138
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,295
Go say hi.

139
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,159
I can't just go say hi.

140
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,374
I need a plan.

141
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,415
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom,

142
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,359
then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...

143
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,764
Hi, have you met Ted ?

144
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:20,393
Let me guess... Ted.

145
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,253
Sorry, Lilly.
I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,445
- Take us to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

147
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,708
Did you hit her ?

148
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:31,902
Hit me ? Please !

149
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,810
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.

150
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,370
He's all like, "Oh, honey. Did that hurt ?"

151
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,040
And, I'm like, "Come on !
Let me have it, you pansy !"

152
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,516
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, no ! It's okay.

153
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,386
Go on.

154
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,449
So, these, uh, spankings...

155
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,309
you in pajamas or au naturel ?

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,643
So, what do you do ?

157
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,893
Well, kind of a reporter.

159
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,251
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.

160
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,678
You know, like, um...

161
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,185
monkey who can play the ukulele.

162
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,277
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.

163
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:06,958
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla with an upright bass ?

164
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,292
Sorry. You're really pretty.

165
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,743
Oh, your friends don't seem to happy.

166
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,901
Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.

167
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,397
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

168
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:20,869
You know if it'll make your friend feel better,

169
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,992
you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.

170
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,914
She would love that !

171
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,247
And it does look fun in the movies.

172
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,427
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night ?

173
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:30,632
Oh, I can't.

174
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,651
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

175
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,003
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.

176
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,497
Guess who's covering it ?

177
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,587
That's gonna take a week ?

178
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,533
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

179
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,996
Hey ! What's takin' so long ?

180
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,550
Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how 'bout tomorrow night ?

181
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,317
Yeah. What the hell ?

182
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,557
Jerk !

183
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,764
That was fun.

184
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:01,738
De... wait for it... nied !

185
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,143
Denied !

186
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,836
We're goin' out tomorrow night.

187
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:07,238
I thought we were playin' laser tag tomorrow night.

188
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,716
Yeah, I was never gonna go play laser tag.

189
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,079
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.

190
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,673
That is one badass blue French horn.

191
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:20,298
Yeah.

192
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,987
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

193
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,609
Son, a piece of advice :

194
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:29,064
when you go on a first date, you really don't wanna say "Smurf penis."

195
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,499
Girls don't ordinarily like that.

196
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,887
But this was no ordinary girl.

197
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,311
Lilly ?

198
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,968
How long have you been sitting there ?

199
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,875
Stupid eye patch.

200
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:52,395
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

201
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,677
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman ?

202
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,432
Now, let's see... she likes dogs ?

203
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,905
I've got five dogs.

204
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,798
She drinks scotch ?

205
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,680
I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,679
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters ?

207
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,402
Ray ! When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "Yes !"

208
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,664
And I'm saving the best for last.

209
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:14,112
Do you want these ?
I hate olives.

210
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,052
She hates olives ! Awesome !

211
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,822
The olive theory.

212
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,598
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshall and Lilly.

213
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,281
He hates olives, she loves them.

214
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,138
In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.

215
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,612
Perfect balance.

216
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:30,487
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.

217
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,591
I could take 'em off your hands.

218
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,339
They're all yours.

219
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,412
Oh, it is on !

220
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,076
It is on till the break of dawn.

221
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:43,476
But wait.

222
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,001
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened ?

223
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,034
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.

224
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,800
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.

225
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,057
- No green clarinet ?
- Nope.

226
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,588
Come on. No purple tuba ?

227
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,635
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

228
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:58,833
There you are !

229
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,931
We got a jumper.

230
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,845
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

231
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,386
Come on. You're coverin' it !

232
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,149
Um... all right.
I'll be right there.

233
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,477
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,330
I had a really great time tonight.

235
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,404
Yeah.

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,394
So ?! Did you kiss her ?

237
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,563
No. The moment wasn't right.

238
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,807
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.

239
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,320
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

240
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,030
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.

241
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,461
So you chickened out like a little bitch.

242
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,163
What ? I did not chicken out.

243
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:30,798
You know what ?

244
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,423
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate

245
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,456
who hasn't been single since the first week of college.

246
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,026
Anyone who's single would tell you the same thing,

247
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,530
even the dumbest single person alive.

248
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,939
And if you don't believe me, call him.

249
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,462
Hey, loser.

250
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,605
How's not playing laser tag ?

251
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,873
Because playing laser tag is awesome !

252
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,625
- Oh, I killed you, Conner !
- Don't make me get your mom !

253
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,698
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion on something.

254
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,251
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

255
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,332
And suit up !

256
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,657
So, these guys think I chickened out.

257
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:00,758
What do you think ?

258
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:04,549
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.

259
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,898
She didn't even give me the signal.

260
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,752
What, is she gonna, she gonna bat her eyes ayou in Morse code ?

261
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,724
"Ted... kiss me."
No ! You just kiss her !

262
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,725
Not if you don't get the signal.

263
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,320
Did Marshall give me the signal ?

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,713
No ! I didn't. I swear.

265
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:26,651
But, see, at least tonight,

266
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,199
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

267
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:28,979
never gonna happen.

268
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,245
You should have kissed her.

269
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,275
Oh, I should have kissed her.

270
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,367
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.

271
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,627
A week ? That's like a year in hot girl time.

272
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:37,837
She'll forget all about you.

273
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:41,158
Mark my words... you will never see that one again.

274
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,756
There she is.

275
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,791
Ooh ! She's cute.
Hey, Carl, turn it up.

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,750
...persuaded him to reconsider.

277
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,807
At which point, the man came down off the ledge,

278
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,690
giving this bizarre story a happy ending.

279
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,116
- Reporting from Metro One News...
- Guy didn't jump.

280
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,066
I'm gonna go kiss her.

281
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,202
Right now.

282
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,582
Look, dude.
It's midnight.

283
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:04,323
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freakin' crazy.

284
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,801
I never do anything crazy.

285
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,334
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.

286
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,704
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

287
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,197
This may be the only moment I'm gonna get.

288
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,038
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.

289
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,727
I gotta take the leap !

290
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,905
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

291
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,404
'cause for me it's fall in love and get married,

292
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,444
and for him it's... death.

293
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,046
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

294
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,710
By the way, did I congratulate you two ?

295
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,773
I'm doing this.

296
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:29,977
Let's go.

297
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,730
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

298
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:33,533
Barney ?

299
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,141
All right, but under one condition.

300
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,147
Look at you, you beautiful bastard. You suited up !

301
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,913
This is totally going in my blog !

302
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:44,859
Stop the car.

303
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,296
Uh, pull over right here.

304
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,090
I gotta do something.

305
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,895
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.

306
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,512
Enjoy your coffee.

307
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,043
Go ! Go ! Go !

308
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,615
Everybody brings flowers.

309
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,056
Okay.

310
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,254
Moment of truth.

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,196
Wish me luck.

312
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,998
Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

313
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:19,443
"This just in." Okay.

314
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,303
Kiss her, Ted !
Kiss her good !

315
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,667
Kiss the crap outta that girl !

316
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,787
Marshall, remember this night.

317
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,951
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech,

318
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,057
you're gonna tell this story.

319
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,387
Why does he get to be the best man ?

320
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,434
I'm your best friend !

321
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,825
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.

322
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,294
Unfortunately, one particular  thought did not.

323
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,065
I've got five dogs.

324
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,489
Not good. Not good.

325
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,157
- No !
- Get back in there !

326
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,773
You're wearing a suit !

327
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,305
Ted ?

328
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,158
Hi.

329
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,053
I was just, uh...

330
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,327
Come on up.

331
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,428
He's in.

332
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,712
So...

333
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,872
Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl ?

334
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,102
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

335
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:21,628
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.

336
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,204
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

337
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,708
The women hot there ?

338
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,033
Here's a picture of my wife.

339
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:32,950
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

340
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,529
She's lovely.

341
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,427
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit ?

342
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,505
I was just hoping to...

343
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,641
get those olives...

344
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,480
that you said I could have.

345
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:51,525
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth ?

346
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,033
Are you trying to get me drunk ?

347
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,275
For starters.

348
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:10,002
So, Marshall, this olive theory, based on you and Lilly ?

349
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,558
You hate olives.

350
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,492
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.

351
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,839
Yeah. Hate olives.

352
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,460
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street, dish of olives, you had some... what up ?

353
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:25,734
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.

354
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,734
- I swear.
- I swear.

355
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,120
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,012
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.

357
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:38,311
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives."
- But, you like olives.

358
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,783
Well, I was 18, okay ?
I was a virgin.

359
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,985
Been waitin' my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.

360
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,542
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.

361
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,686
Don't get married.

362
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,897
I think I like your olive theory.

363
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:02,553
I think I like your new French horn.

364
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,370
I think I like your nose.

365
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,518
I think I'm in love with you.

366
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:11,217
What ?! What ?! What ?!

367
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,643
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right ?

368
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,953
You know what that is.

369
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,685
Hunger.

370
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,524
You're hungry for experience.

371
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,025
Hungry for something new.

372
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,094
Hungry for olives.

373
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,184
But you're too scared to do anything about it.

374
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,029
Yeah, I'm scared, okay ?

375
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,924
But, when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lilly...

376
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,390
committing, forever, no other women...

377
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,808
doesn't scare me at all.

378
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,496
I'm marrying that girl.

379
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,075
Lilly.

380
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,689
Lilly, I like olives.

381
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,177
We'll make it work.

382
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,160
So, Orlando.
You gonna hit Disneyworld ?

383
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,428
You love me ?!

384
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,784
I-I-I can't believe I said that.

385
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,236
Why did I say that ?
Who says that ?

386
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,116
I should just go.

387
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,259
Hold on.

388
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,663
Wait a minute.

389
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,385
Promised you these.

390
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,366
Olives.
Thanks. I love you.

391
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,344
What is wrong with me ?

392
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:24,225
Why are we still sitting here ?

393
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:25,849
Let's go. We can still make last call.

394
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,706
What do you say, Lil ?

395
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,239
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum ?

396
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,844
'Cause you're a pirate.

397
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,136
Okay, eye patch, gone.

398
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,836
And we can't just abandon Ted.

399
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,563
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.

400
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,367
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

401
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,662
You think they're doin' it ?

402
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,037
You think they're doin' it in front of the dogs ?

403
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,337
Doggy style.

404
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,690
Hey, there was a girl in college, she had this golden retriever...

405
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,118
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

406
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,296
Hit it, Ranjit.

407
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,453
So, when you tell this story to your friends,

408
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,520
could you avoid the word "psycho ?"

409
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:04,456
I'd prefer. "eccentric."

410
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,951
Good night... psycho.

411
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:11,899
Great.

412
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,600
Um, how do I get to the F train ?

413
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:17,928
Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right.

414
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,373
You know what ?

415
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,378
I'm done being single.

416
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,203
I'm not good at it.

417
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,865
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.

418
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:33,651
But... it sucks that you can't.

419
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,857
I'll tell you something, though.

420
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:39,604
If a woman... not you, just some hypothetical woman...

421
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,382
were to bear with me through all this,

422
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,908
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

423
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,707
Because, that's the stuff I'd be good at,

424
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,153
stuff like making her laugh and being a good father.

425
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,569
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.

426
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,547
Being a good kisser.

427
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,542
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.

428
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,106
Oh, I've got references.

429
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,380
Good night, Ted.

430
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,834
And I'm a good handshaker.

431
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,285
That's a pretty great handshake.

432
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:17,813
And that was it.

433
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,613
I'll probably never see her again.

434
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,260
What ?

435
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,444
That was the signal.

436
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:28,175
That long, lingering handshake ?
You should have kissed her.

437
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,368
There's no such thing as "the signal."

438
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,580
But, yeah, that was the signal.

439
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:34,532
Signal.

440
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,983
Ah, Carl, thank you.

441
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,863
Something I gotta do.

442
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:42,246
By the way, you should have kissed her.

443
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,633
Carl ! You guys weren't there.

444
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,006
I am so turned on right now.

445
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:50,594
Guys, trust me.

446
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:51,999
I've seen the signal.

447
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,603
That was not the signal.

448
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,531
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

449
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,905
- To my fiance.
- To the future.

450
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,732
To one hell of a night !

451
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,397
That was not the signal.

452
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,709
I asked her about it years later.

453
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,783
And, yeah, that was the signal.

454
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,272
I could have kissed her.

455
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,146
But that's the funny thing about destiny.

456
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,175
It happens whether you plan it or not.

457
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,061
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again,

458
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,782
but it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle

459
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,525
to see the picture that was forming.

460
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:27,880
Because, that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.

461
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,481
Aunt Robin ?

462
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,472
I thought this was how you met mom !

463
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,509
Will you relax ?
I'm getting to it.

464
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:38,540
Like I said, it's a long story.

465
