1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:05,695
Wait.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,297
<i>Grunkle Stan!</i>

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:10,600
Kids! I can't believe it!

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,569
I thought I lost you two.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,538
- Ahh!
- Mr. Pines, it's really you!

6
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,440
I've been hugging strangers
to practice for this moment.

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,409
We missed you, you old codger.

8
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,628
I've missed you knuckleheads too.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,413
It's good to have you back.

10
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,749
So... what's everyone doing here?

11
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,585
Yeah, there's, like, 
monsters and gnomes.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,720
And is Pacifica wearing a potato sack?

13
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:33,590
Hey! Even in a sack
I still look better than you.

14
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,293
It's... It's a long story.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,727
Hey, is anyone gonna feed me?

16
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:41,431
Larry King's disembodied
wax head wants num-nums.

17
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,700
We're trying to ration
our food, remember?

18
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:47,537
- Mmm... mmm...
- Uhh, it's happening again!

19
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,739
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>

20
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,325
Eye bat!

21
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,744
Evasive maneuvers!

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,614
- Shh! Keep it down!
- Get the lights!

23

<b>2x20 - Weirdmageddon, Part III</b>

25
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:49,394
Welcome to what's left
of normal around here...

26
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,428
home base.

27
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,482
Ow!

28
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:56,601
We have...
# Several injuries #

29
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,287
- Ooh! - Ow!
- My liver, girl!

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,473
Rumble McSkirmish?

31
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:04,376
Do not be afraid.
Weirdmaggedon has taught me

32
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,214
there are some battles I cannot win.
I am now Humble McSkirmish.

33
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:11,416
Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?

34
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,301
So I was hammering signs out back

35
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,420
when the sky started
vomiting nightmares.

36
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,355
I listen to a lot of AM radio,

37
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,158
so I knew what this meant...
the end of the world.

38
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:23,562
<i>What I didn't expect
was what happened next.</i>

39
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,290
<i>Turns out whatever you and my brother</i>

40
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,324
<i>did to the Shack with
your unicorn voodoo</i>

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,094
<i>made the crazy place
invincible to weirdness.</i>

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,133
Of course... the unicorn spell!

43
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,336
That's why this is the only
place Bill's magic can't touch.

44
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,439
That's when Possum
Breath over here shows up

45
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:53,175
leading a bunch of injured
stragglers through the forest.

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,376
They needed a place to stay,

47
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,480
and since the Mayor got captured,
I elected myself de facto chief.

48
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:02,084
The plan's to stay in here and
eat brown meat until we run out.

49
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:05,420
- Then I vote we eat the gnomes.
- Hey, I'm short, not deaf!

50
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:08,223
Shh! Shh!
Stress will make you chewy.

51
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:11,259
Grunkle Stan, we can't all
just hide inside the Shack.

52
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,161
There's a town in need of saving!

53
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:16,364
Me and Ford tried to do it,
but he got captured by Bill.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,168
Serves that jerk right!
My brother's had some stupid plans,

55
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,438
but going up against an all-powerful
space demon was his worst one yet.

56
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:26,441
Trust me, we have everything
we need right here.

57
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:30,178
It's not the Ritz, but at least the
monsters inside know how to massage.

58
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:33,281
- You know Shiatsu?
- Yes, I've taken some classes.

59
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,450
So, you're really just
gonna let Bill win?

60
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,452
Look, kiddo.
We got a good deal here.

61
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:41,123
Besides, I'm sure wherever
the rest of the townsfolk are,

62
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,483
they're fine.

63
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,260
<i>This is Shandra Jimenez</i>

64
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:47,112
<i>reporting live from the
inside of Bill's castle.</i>

65
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,806
<i>Here for the first time are images of</i>

66
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,449
<i>what's happened to
the captured townsfolk.</i>

67
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>Viewers are advised to look away</i>

68
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,502
<i>if they don't want to see their friends</i>

69
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,404
<i>turned into a twisted
throne of human agony.</i>

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,174
- Mom and Dad?
- My family!

71
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,375
Deputy Durland!

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,111
<i>Is there no one who will
save the people of this town?</i>

73
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,481
<i>I'm Shandra Jimenez,</i>

74
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:07,149
<i>and I'm being turned into
stone by a flying eyeball.</i>

75
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,055
Oh, no. My parents are bad,

76
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:17,125
but even they don't
deserve to be turned to stone.

77
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,263
Curse you, Bill! Why must
you take everything we love?!

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,151
Guys, don't you see?
Our friends need us,

79
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,436
but we only save them if we fight back!

80
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:32,073
Mabel is right.
Bill wants us to run and hide.

81
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:34,109
He wants us to think he's invincible.

82
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:36,044
But Ford told me before he was captured

83
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,313
that he knows Bill's secret weakness.

84
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,451
- Weakness?
- Now, if we band together,

85
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:47,222
<i>if we combine all of
our strength, our smarts,</i>

86
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:51,359
<i>- our... whatever Toby has...
- Aureus rashes!</i>

87
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:54,029
...then we just might
be able to rescue Ford,

88
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:57,199
learn Bill's weakness,
and save Gravity Falls!

89
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:02,070
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

90
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,072
Have you all forgotten
who's in charge here?

91
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,107
Besides, we're only safe inside!

92
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,343
It's not like we can take
the Mystery Shack to Bill.

93
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,245
Wha... Whoa!

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,181
Holy hootenanny!
Flapjack and fiddlebanjos!

95
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,083
Sorry. Sorry.
Got a little excited.

96
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,986
What I meant to say is,

97
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:21,022
I think I figured out a way
to fight Bill and rescue Ford.

98
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,191
But we're all gonna
have to work together!

99
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:27,062
Now...
if you just...

100
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,017
<i>Don't worry, Ford.
We're coming for you!</i>

101
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:39,074
Let me go!
You insane three-sided...

102
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,219
Wha... What is this place?

103
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,347
<i>♪ We'll meet again ♪</i>

104
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:49,050
<i>♪ Don't know where, don't know when ♪</i>

105
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:54,122
<i>♪ Oh, I know we'll meet
again some sunny day ♪</i>

106
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,257
Wh... Where am I?

107
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,225
<i>You're in the penthouse suite, kid!</i>

108
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,394
<i>The tip of the pyramid! Have a drink.</i>

109
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,097
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

110
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,400
<i>You know that couch is
made from living human skin?</i>

111
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:09,371
Quit the games, Cipher!

112
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:12,207
If I'm still alive, you
must want something from me.

113
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:16,177
<i>Ah, sharp as ever, Fordsy.
As you may have noticed...</i>

114
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:19,114
<i>I've recently had a
multi-dimensional makeover!</i>

115
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,182
<i>I control space and matter,</i>

116
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,268
<i>and now that that dumb
baby's out of the way,</i>

117
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,020
<i>time itself!</i>

118
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,355
<i>- But I wasn't always this way.
- Oof!</i>

119
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,274
<i>You think those chains are tight?</i>

120
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,443
<i>Imagine living in the
second dimension...</i>

121
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,362
<i>flat minds in a flat
world with flat dreams.</i>

122
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:38,199
<i>I liberated my dimension, Stanford,
and I'm here to liberate yours.</i>

123
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:41,136
<i>There's just one hitch.
As it turns out,</i>

124
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:45,040
<i>my weirdness can't escape the
magical confines of this town!</i>

125
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,208
<i>There's something keeping me in.</i>

126
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:51,379
Incredible! Gravity Falls' Natural Law
of Weirdness Magnetism.

127
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,248
I studied this years ago!

128
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:56,051
<i>- And did you find a way to undo it?
- Of course!</i>

129
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:58,253
There's a simple equation that
could collapse the barrier.

130
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,055
But I'd never tell you!

131
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,991
<i>Listen, Ford, if you just
tell me that equation,</i>

132
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,293
<i>finally your dimension will be free!</i>

133
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,130
<i>Anything will be possible!</i>

134
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:18,974
<i>I'll remake a fun world...
a better world!</i>

135
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,293
<i>A party that never ends
with a host that never dies!</i>

136
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:25,413
<i>No more restrictions!
No more laws!</i>

137
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,316
<i>You'd be one of us.
All-powerful!</i>

138
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,052
<i>Greater than anything you've imagined!</i>

139
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,154
<i>And all I need is your help.</i>

140
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,156
You're insane if you
think I'll help you.

141
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:38,093
<i>Ha ha ha!
I'm insane either way, brainiac!</i>

142
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,396
<i>But have it your way.
I'll just fish around</i>

143
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:43,999
<i>and get that equation
directly out of your mind!</i>

144
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,434
Not so fast!
You know the rules, Bill.

145
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:51,306
You may be able to haunt
my dreams, but you can't

146
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:54,342
enter my mind unless I shake
your hand and let you in.

147
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:59,030
<i>You're making this so
much harder than it needs to be.</i>

148
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,999
<i>Everyone has a weakness, tough guy!</i>

149
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:05,153
<i>I'll make you talk!
It's only a matter of time.</i>

150
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,988
All right. I've made some thingamadiculous
robomajigs in my day,

151
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,891
but this is the first one
that won't be used for evil!

152
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,727
<i>Whoa! These blueprints
are incredible, McGucket.</i>

153
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,996
<i>This is your most
amazing invention yet.</i>

154
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,967
Question: Does it have any gun-swords?
I watch a lot of anime and, uh,

155
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,770
trust me, you're gonna
want some gun-swords.

156
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,104
What's an "anime"?

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,708
- We have much to discuss.
- Discuss, nothing!

158
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,778
These scribbles are a bunch
of cockamamie balderdash!

159
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:38,945
Excuse my French.

160
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,148
 _

161
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,884
And where would you even find a bunch
of idiots crazy enough to build it?

162
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,887
Grunkle Stan, you're
lookin' at those idiots.

163
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,756
Idiots!

164
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,860
_

165
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,116
Whoa... What...
What are you...

166
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,936
Hey... Hey, now.
Hey! Don't touch that.

167
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,004
Hey...

168
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:10,744
Uhh! Uhh!

169
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:33,749
_

170
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:37,204
Thanks for these
apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.

171
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,706
The end of the world has
never been so comfortable.

172
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:40,941
<i>Mm-hmm!</i>

173
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:47,948
Uhh! Fine, I'll wear it.
But I'm not gonna like it.

174
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,784
Admit it. This is the best
day of the end of the world.

175
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,819
I think we actually have
a chance to beat Bill

176
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,631
- and win back our future.
- Yeah. Getting to actually live to see our

177
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,160
13th birthday party is the only
birthday present I want right now.

178
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,839
Hey, if we're lucky enough
to get there, I guarantee

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,483
this whole town is gonna
throw you the best birthday

180
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,068
- party you've ever seen.
- Thanks, Soos.

181
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,203
Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?

182
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,072
This whole plan is bonkers.

183
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,808
But of course, no one asked
the Chief what he thinks.

184
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:18,144
- After all I've done for everyone!
- Schmebulock.

185
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,114
Yeah, exactly... it's a
total load of schmebulock.

186
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,086
Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan?
You're acting grunklier than usual.

187
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:29,973
It's this darn plan to save my brother.
If you didn't notice, I already

188
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,926
saved him once from that portal,
and he never thanked me!

189
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,996
He causes the end of the world,
and somehow it's still always

190
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,832
"Stan's the screw-up, Ford's the hero."

191
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,834
Well, maybe people think he's a hero

192
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,003
because he didn't want to
hide in the Mystery Shack!

193
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:46,172
Well, maybe if he hid in the Mystery
Shack he wouldn't have been captured!

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,976
Guys! Guys! Trust me,
tomorrow's gonna be great!

195
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,779
- I believe in us.
- Help! Leader Mabel!

196
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,181
I keep accidentally
flexing through my sweater!

197
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,250
It happened again!

198
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:01,988
Those weird cow-monsters
are delightful! Coming!

199
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,929
All right, fellas!

200
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:12,098
Let's hope this turns out
better than my other inventions!

201
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:15,001
Everybody ready?
Dipper, now!

202
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,098
<i>Huh?! Whoa!</i>

203
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:39,025
Forgive me, boy. Your
hyper-flammable merchandise

204
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,027
is the only thing keeping me goin'.

205
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,164
What in blazes?!

206
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:50,203
<i>No! No! Nooo!</i>

207
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,873
<i>Ready to talk now?</i>

208
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,961
I won't.
I won't let you into my mind!

209
00:11:57,996 --> 00:12:01,164
<i>What do you think, pals?
Another 500 volts?</i>

210
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,749
<i>Hey, do you hear that?</i>

211
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,924
<i>What?!
I just fixed that door!</i>

212
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,070
It's the Shacktron, dude!

213
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:27,907
They made the house into a robot.
Fascinating!

214
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:32,112
<i>So the mortals are trying
to fight back, huh? Adorable!</i>

215
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:37,851
<i>Henchmaniacs, you know
what to do! Take them out!</i>

216
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,995
This was a bad idea.

217
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,513
<i>Uh, hey, dudes. Is this thing on? </i>

218
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,349
<i>Tes...</i>

219
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,617
<i>Heh. Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes</i>

220
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,254
<i>to hand over Ford, or we'll
have to, like, fight and junk?</i>

221
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,390
<i>Hey, you're a little cutie.</i>

222
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:08,227
I have butchered millions
on countless moons!

223
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,396
Whoa. I liked you
better before you talked.

224
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,381
Real... real bring-down, this guy.

225
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,333
Attack!

226
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,402
All right, dudes!

227
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,337
Everyone! Like we planned!

228
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:20,506
Three, two, one. Go!

229
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,720
Ha ha ha! Good pig.

230
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,359
Get 'em, Gobblewonker!

231
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,280
Hyah! Hyah!

232
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,365
Oh, no, you don't!

233
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,775
Everyone! Incoming!

234
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,276
Does this thing have an escape hatch?

235
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:11,257
Everybody! Maximum power!

236
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:14,643
And... now!

237
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,606
<i>Guys, seriously?
You had, like, one job to do here.</i>

238
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,708
Bravo, Dipper and Mabel!

239
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,412
<i>Well, would ya look at that?
Those kids really care about you.</i>

240
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:34,713
<i>And you care about them.</i>

241
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,582
<i> Don't you?</i>

242
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,717
What are you... Oh. Oh, no.

243
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,620
<i>Perhaps torturing
those kids will make you talk!</i>

244
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,490
No. No! Not the kids! You ca...

245
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,259
<i>Lets get this over with.</i>

246
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:02,408
<i>What the... No!
No! No! No! No!</i>

247
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,212
Attack!

248
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,353
<i>My eye!
Do you have any idea</i>

249
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,355
<i>how long it takes to regenerate that?</i>

250
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,357
We've got him distracted!
Now's our chance!

251
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:21,416
Rescue team, move out!

252
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,470
OK, everyone!
We get in, rescue Ford,

253
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,940
get out, save the world.
Piece of cake.

254
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,575
Just so we're clear,
if I die, I'm suing all of you.

255
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:39,545
Hey, on second thought,
maybe we could come up with a plan

256
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,647
that doesn't involve us
plummeting to our certain death.

257
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,249
- Now!
- Ahh!

258
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:53,118
- Oh, man, oh, man...
- Whoo-hoo!

259
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,581
<i>Oh, man.
It looks even worse up close.</i>

260
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,389
<i>I found Great-uncle Ford!</i>

261
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,226
He's golden!
But not in the good way!

262
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,562
Great. Grab him
and let's get out of here.

263
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:33,432
- But how are we going to unfreeze them?
- I know!

264
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,239
Gideon! What happened to you?

265
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,274
Bill captured me.
He's been forcing me

266
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,411
to do cute dances in this
cage for all eternity.

267
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,447
I'm so tired of being cute!

268
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,282
How do we undo this?

269
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,651
Mayor Tyler.
He's the load-bearing human.

270
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:55,314
Pull him out, and the
whole thing goes down.

271
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,482
Ah. My mouth tastes like nightmares!

272
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:10,603
I think I'm dark and
tortured for reals now.

273
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:13,606
This experience will
forever scar Tad Strange.

274
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,755
No more sailor suits!

275
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,412
- Wendy!
- Guys!

276
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,582
- Mom! Dad!
- Durland!

277
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,453
My Blubs!

278
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:31,256
Don't you ever scare
me like that again!

279
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,596
Kids! Ah, you did it!

280
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:40,615
I knew I could count on you two.

281
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:44,503
Fiddldeford! I... I haven't
seen you since we parted ways.

282
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,438
You must hate me.

283
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:51,610
I've tried forgettin'.
Maybe I should try forgiving.

284
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:55,532
- Come here, old friend.
- Hey, good to see you too, bro.

285
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,316
Now let's get out of here, huh?

286
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,518
Listen, Uncle Ford, we
don't have a lot of time.

287
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,520
Remember how you told me
right before you were frozen

288
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,422
that you knew Bill's weakness?

289
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,292
- Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?
- I... I do!

290
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:10,295
Now, does anyone have a pen?
Pencil? Anything?

291
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,363
Ah.

292
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,532
Perfect!

293
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,469
Uh, we've got Bill outside,

294
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,638
but I don't know how long
we can keep him occupied.

295
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,473
Yes, yes. Good, good.

296
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:24,576
Drawing a circle on the floor.
Well, he's lost his mind.

297
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:28,313
My mind is fine. And there is
a way to beat him... with this!

298
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,352
The world's most confusing
game of hopscotch?

299
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:34,653
No, a prophecy.

300
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:37,573
Although it would be
a pretty fun game of hopscotch.

301
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,659
<i>Many years ago,
I found ten symbols in a cave.</i>

302
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,530
<i>Some I recognized then.
Some I only recognize now.</i>

303
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:48,217
<i>The native people of Gravity Falls
prophesized that these symbols</i>

304
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,636
<i>could create a force strong
enough to vanquish Bill.</i>

305
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,047
<i>With Bill defeated,
his weirdness would be</i>

306
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,424
<i>reversed and the town could be saved.</i>

307
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,277
This whole time I thought
it was just superstition.

308
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:01,480
But seeing you all here now
I finally understand that it's destiny!

309
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,450
<i>Dipper, the pine tree.</i>

310
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,552
<i>Mabel, the shooting star.</i>

311
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:10,522
The question mark.
This one's unsolvable.

312
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,524
That one's easy.

313
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,461
You've been rockin' that dumb
hoodie since the seventh grade.

314
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:18,297
Whoa. Destiny hoodie!

315
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,632
The tent of telepathy sign!
That must be Gideon.

316
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:23,402
Whoo!
An excuse to stand next to Mabel!

317
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:27,239
- Don't turn this into a big deal.
- Oh, I won't.

318
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,640
<i> I will.</i>

319
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,314
<i>What the...</i>

320
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,634
<i>Hey, Achilles!</i>

321
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:41,620
<i>Nice work with the heel!</i>

322
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:44,389
<i>Fore!</i>

323
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,697
Hold hands, everyone! This is
a mystical human energy circuit.

324
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,333
Ice? Who's Ice?

325
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,435
They symbol's needn't
all be literal, Dipper.

326
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,271
It just has to be someone
cool in the face of danger.

327
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,706
<i>Wendy! Wendy!</i>

328
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,609
Shut up, you guys.

329
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:07,579
Much like the spectacles
need to be someone scholarly.

330
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,649
- Heh heh!
- This is freaky.

331
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,618
<i>Now hold hands, everyone.</i>

332
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,670
Ew! I'm not touching that.

333
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,674
Do it, sweetie. Do the
one thing no one in our

334
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,626
family has ever done...
touch the hillbilly.

335
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:33,438
Great-uncle Ford, I think it's working!

336
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,741
Yes, this is it!

337
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,377
The rest of you get out!
It's too dangerous!

338
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,314
We just need one more person...

339
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:47,553
Stanley! Stanley, get over here!
You're the only one left.

340
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,488
You realize this is
a bunch of hogwash, right?

341
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:52,658
You really think some caveman graffiti
is gonna stop that monster?

342
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,760
Dang it, old man, now's not the time!

343
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,953
- Come on!
- What are you doing? You're gonna ruin this!

344
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,265
I've never held hands this
long, and I very uncomfortable!

345
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,334
Whoa. Hey, I'm not
the enemy here, people.

346
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,703
Don't forget who literally
created the end of the world.

347
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm sorry, Stanley. I know.
Just help me fix it! Please!

348
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:11,610
Fine. Just do one thing.
Say "thank you."

349
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,579
- What?
- I spent thirty years

350
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,447
trying to bring you
back into this dimension,

351
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,416
and you still haven't thanked me!

352
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:21,420
You want me to shake your hand?
Say "thank you"!

353
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,723
- Fine. Thank you.
- Now, see?

354
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,659
Between me and him, I'm
not always the bad twin.

355
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:30,262
Between "him and me."

356
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:32,531
Grammar, Stanley.

357
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,701
I'll "Grammar, Stanley"  you,
you stuck-up son-of-a...

358
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,502
Don't jeopardize this, you idiot!

359
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:39,721
<i>- Everything's on the line!
- Stop it!</i>

360
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,475
Join hands!

361
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,611
<i>Oh, no, it's Bill!</i>

362
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,597
<i>Right? Isn't that what
you're all thinking?</i>

363
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:52,517
<i>Hey, Gideon, why aren't you dancing?
Chop chop, huh?</i>

364
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,457
<i>Ha ha ha ho!
This is just too perfect! </i>

365
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:03,227
<i>Didn't you brainiacs know
the zodiac doesn't work</i>

366
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:06,430
<i>if you don't all hold hands?
And what's better,</i>

367
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:08,999
<i>you've brought every
threat to my power together</i>

368
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,001
<i>in one easy-to-destroy circle!</i>

369
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,303
Oh, no!

370
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:17,274
- My hair!
- My hair also!

371
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,278
<i>You guys want to see what
happens to your friends</i>

372
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,113
<i>when you can't get along?</i>

373
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,383
- Hey! You give them back!
- You've gone too far, cipher!

374
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:29,804
Yeah! We're not scared of you!

375
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,089
<i>Oh, but you should be.</i>

376
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,163
Oh, no!

377
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:44,068
<i>Ya know, this castle could
really use some decoration!</i>

378
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,309
<i>Looks like it's too late
for your friends, Stanford!</i>

379
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,478
 Kids!

380
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:57,081
<i>But you can still save your family!</i>

381
00:22:57,116 --> 00:23:00,150
<i>Last chance: Tell me how
to take Weirdmageddon global</i>

382
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:01,285
<i>and I'll spare the kids!</i>

383
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,105
- No! Don't do it!
- Yeah! Bill makes bad deals!

384
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:10,194
<i>Don't you toy with me, shooting star!
I see everything!</i>

385
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:13,363
<i>Ow! Not again!
Why?! Every time!</i>

386
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,232
Nice shot, pumpkin!

387
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,367
<i>I just regenerated that eye!</i>

388
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:21,238
I know that hurts, because I've
accidentally done it to myself...

389
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:23,240
multiple times!

390
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:31,014
Save yourselves!
Run! We'll take care of Bill!

391
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,717
What?! That's a suicide mission!

392
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:36,470
- Trust us. We've beat him before...
- and we'll beat him again!

393
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:42,309
Hey, Bill!
Come and get us, you pointy jerk!

394
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,331
What? No! It's too dangerous!

395
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,152
<i>Not so fast! You two wait here!</i>

396
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:56,340
<i>I've got some children
I need to make into corpses!</i>

397
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,442
<i> See ya real soon!</i>

398
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,896
Bill, no!

399
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:06,049
- Oh! What do we do? What do we do?
- Kids!

400
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,421
<i>When I get my hands on you kids,</i>

401
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,458
<i>I'm gonna disassemble your molecules!</i>

402
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,330
<i>You've tricked me for the last time!</i>

403
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,004
<i>Ohh! I can't believe this!</i>

404
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,106
The kids are gonna die,
and it's all my fault...

405
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:32,122
because I couldn't
shake your stupid hand!

406
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:36,013
Ahh, Dad was right about me.
I am a screw-up.

407
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:39,233
Ah, don't blame yourself. I'm
the one who made a deal with

408
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:42,419
Bill in the first place. I
fell for all his easy flattery.

409
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:45,389
You would have seen him
for the scam artist he is.

410
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:48,358
How did things get so
messed up between us?

411
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:50,327
We used to be like Dipper and Mabel.

412
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,329
The world's about to end
and they still work together.

413
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:55,098
- How do they do it?
- Easy. They're kids.

414
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,301
They don't know any better.

415
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,435
Whoa, where you goin'?

416
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,304
I'm gonna play the
only card we have left.

417
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,239
Let Bill into my mind.

418
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:05,442
He'll be able to take over the
galaxy, and maybe even worse,

419
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:07,978
but at least he might
let the kids free.

420
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,346
What?! Are you kiddin' me?!

421
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,082
Are you honestly telling me
there's nothing else we can do?!

422
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,450
Bill's only weak in the mind space.

423
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,452
If I didn't have this
darn plate in my head,

424
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,121
we could just erase
him with the memory gun

425
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:20,090
when he steps inside my mind.

426
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,458
What if he goes into my mind?

427
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:24,194
My brain isn't good for anything.

428
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,197
There's nothing in your mind
he wants. It has to be me.

429
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,082
We need to take his deal.

430
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,301
It's the only way he'll agree
to save you and the kids.

431
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:34,037
Do you really think he's
gonna make good on that deal?

432
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,139
What other choice do we have?

433
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:42,279
<i>I'm starting to think
there's no way out of here.</i>

434
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:46,116
Like Grunkle Stan always says,
when one door closes,

435
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,286
choose a nearby wall and
bash it in with brute force!

436
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,225
Ha! Now let's round up the townsfolk,

437
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,295
and together we can defeat...
Oh, no!

438
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:05,369
- You'll never take us alive, monsters!
- That's fine with us!

439
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,140
<i>- Oh, no!
- Peek-a-boo!</i>

440
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,813
<i>All right, Ford, time's up!</i>

441
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,117
<i>I've got the kids!</i>

442
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:23,353
<i>I think I'm gonna kill one of
'em now, just for the heck of it!</i>

443
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:28,358
<i>Eeenie-meenie...
minee...</i>

444
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,776
<i>Wait!</i>

445
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:32,996
I surrender!

446
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:35,332
<i>Good choice.</i>

447
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:38,335
<i>Don't do it, Ford!
It'll destroy the universe!</i>

448
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,405
<i>It's the only way!</i>

449
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:45,976
<i>Even when you're about to die, you
Pines twins just can't get along!</i>

450
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:51,164
My only condition is that you
let my brother and the kids go.

451
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,332
<i>Fine.</i>

452
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,318
No, Grunkle Ford!
Don't trust him!

453
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,090
<i>It's a.... deal!</i>

454
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:20,344
<i>Oh, I'm here. I'm finally here!</i>

455
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:24,314
<i>Look at this place...
a perfect, calm, orderly void.</i>

456
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,249
<i>Gotta hand it to you, Ford,</i>

457
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:29,252
<i>you really know how to clear your...</i>

458
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,022
<i>What?!</i>

459
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:35,158
Ha ha! Do a pretty good
impression of my brother, don't I?

460
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:37,260
Switch clothes and no
one can tell us apart.

461
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:41,054
Welcome to my mind.
Surprised you didn't recognize it.

462
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,084
<i>What?! The deal's off!</i>

463
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:55,345
<i>What the... No, no, no, no!</i>

464
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,447
Oh, yeah.
You're goin' down, Bill.

465
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:59,232
You're gettin' erased.

466
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:01,368
Memory gun. Pretty clever, huh?

467
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:06,356
<i>Y-You idiot! Don't you realize
you're destroying your own mind too?</i>

468
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:09,376
Eh. It's not like I was using
this space for much anyway.

469
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,161
<i>Let me out of here! Let me...</i>

470
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,997
<i>Oh... Why isn't this working?!</i>

471
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,300
Hey, look at me. Turn around and
look at me, you one-eyed demon!

472
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:20,337
You're a real wiseguy, but
you made one fatal mistake.

473
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:22,305
You messed with my family.

474
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,091
<i>You're making a mistake!</i>

475
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,343
<i>I'll give you anything...
money, fame, riches,</i>

476
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:30,313
<i>infinite power, your own galaxy!
Please! No!</i>

477
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,983
<i>What's happening to me?!</i>

478
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:42,025
<i>Staaanleeey!</i>

479
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:56,832
Heh. Guess I was good
for something after all.

480
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:20,297
Hey! Hey!

481
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,067
- Oh...
- Ohh!

482
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,421
Whoa. Huh.

483
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,010
Oh, my gosh!
Grunkle Stan, you did it!

484
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:11,381
Oh, uh, hey there... kiddo.
What's your name?

485
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:15,452
- Grunkle Stan?
- Heh. Who ya talkin' to?

486
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:20,090
C-Come on. It's me.
It's me, Grunkle Stan!

487
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,425
Grunkle Stan, it's me!

488
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:27,063
We had to erase his mind to
defeat Bill. It's all gone.

489
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,199
Stan has no idea, but he did it.

490
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:32,302
He saved the world.
He saved me.

491
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:37,474
You're our hero, Stanley.

492
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:10,073
Hey, this is a real
nice place ya got here.

493
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,143
It's your place, Grunkle Stan.

494
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:15,278
Don't you remember?
Even a little?

495
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,148
Nope, but this chair hugs
my butt like it remembers.

496
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:20,050
Ah.

497
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:23,486
Hey, why the long faces?

498
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:25,488
You guys look like
it's someone's funeral.

499
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:29,259
Who's that big guy crying
in the corner?

500
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,494
We saved the world,
but what's the point?

501
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,130
Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore.

502
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,133
There's gotta be something
we can do to jog his memory!

503
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,103
There isn't.
I'm sorry. Stan's gone.

504
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,405
I know my Grunkle
is in there somewhere!

505
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:46,766
There's gotta be something around
here that can help bring him back!

506
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:51,147
This'll work! This has to work!

507
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,700
<i>Here's the first day we came
to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan.</i>

508
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:57,420
<i>And here's a macaroni
interpretation of my emotions.</i>

509
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:05,145
That time we went fishing.
That Summerween we spent together.

510
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,546
Don't you remember anything?

511
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,149
I'm sorry.
I don't know what this is

512
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:12,152
or who you are or...
Gah! Quit it, Waddles!

513
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,386
I'm trying to remember my life story!

514
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,112
What did you say?

515
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,456
I said get Waddles off of me!

516
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,625
It's working! Keep reading!

517
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,260
Skip to my page!

518
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:22,429
He needs to remember our
boss-employee relationship.

519
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,197
Hey! Just cause I have amnesia,

520
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,598
don't go tryin' to give
yourself a raise, Soos.

521
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,501
- It's happening! Keep going!
- OK. OK!

522
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:33,173
"Day Two. Grunkle Stan smells
weird but we're starting to bond.

523
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,575
He told us a lot about being
a businessman in the '80s

524
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,161
and seemed happy when
we pretended to listen.

525
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,498
He also gave me a grappling hook
which everyone is impressed by.

526
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,168
And in more important news,
I've met some neighborhood hotties!"

527
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:54,572
_

528
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,142
<i>Good Morning, Gravity Falls!</i>

529
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,245
<i>It's another beautiful day,
but every day is beautiful</i>

530
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,982
<i>now that the...
unpleasantness is over.</i>

531
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,052
Git outta here, ya ornery critters!

532
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,057
Ah, good as new.

533
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,061
Oh! Looks like you've got a friend!

534
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,231
Robbie, would you be a dear and
get us the sawed off shotgun?

535
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,267
Ugh. Fine, whatever.

536
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,905
- Brains and so forth!
- Nope! None of that, thank you.

537
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,308
None of us really understand
what just happened,

538
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,077
and none of us want to.

539
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,247
That's why I'm passing
the "Never Mind All That" Act.

540
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,284
If anyone goes asking
around about the "events"

541
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,286
of the last few days, what do we say?

542
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,955
<i>Never Mind All That!</i>

543
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,191
And if you break the rules,
we're gonna zap ya!

544
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,928
Zap! Zap!
We're mad with power!

545
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,329
<i>And love.</i>

546
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,933
<i>In other news,
the Northwest family has gone broke.</i>

547
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,201
<i>After pledging his allegiance to Bill</i>

548
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,904
<i>and then placing all his
savings in weirdness bonds,</i>

549
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,072
<i>Preston Northwest had
to sell his mansion</i>

550
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,275
<i>to preserve his family fortune.</i>

551
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,659
You're only going to have one pony now!

552
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,185
<i>But fortunes have also turned for
local maniac Fiddleford McGucket</i>

553
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,254
<i>who, after regaining his sanity,</i>

554
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,356
<i>has made millions overnight
submitting his patents</i>

555
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,925
<i>to the US government.</i>

556
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,029
<i>I'm gonna buy me a bigger shed!
Hey, that one's for sale!</i>

557
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,932
<i>In other good news,
town hero Stanley Pines</i>

558
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,901
<i>has fully recovered his memory
and will be throwing a party</i>

559
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,203
<i>to celebrate his niece and
nephew's thirteenth birthday</i>

560
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,005
<i>and final day in town.</i>

561
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,941
<i>But other than that, I can safely say</i>

562
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,209
<i>our beloved Gravity
Falls is back to normal.</i>

563
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:45,381
<i>- And now, Bodacious T, with sports.
- It's called Death Ball!</i>

564
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,017
<i>♪ ...to you ♪</i>

565
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,225
I can't believe you all got together
just to throw a party for us!

566
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,962
After all the Pines family
has done for the town,

567
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:02,265
it's the least we could do!
You've helped everyone here.

568
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,868
Thanks to y'all savin' us, I
learned to open my heart to kindness.

569
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,270
No more evil-doin'.

570
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,141
From now on, I'm gonna try to
be Li'l Gideon, regular ol' kid.

571
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,178
Oh... Ha ha! Whoo!

572
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,114
I am bustin' a move
on this skatin' board.

573
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,218
More like busting your pants, loser!

574
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,126
Hee hee hee!

575
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,363
- Dude, make a wish, dawg!
- Ya know, on my first day here,

576
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,032
if you had asked me what
I wanted, I would have said

577
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,968
adventure, mystery, true friends.

578
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,169
But looking here at all of you,

579
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,238
I realize that every wish came true...

580
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,042
- I have everything I wanted.
- If I had only one wish,

581
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,977
it would be to shrink all
of you with a shrink ray

582
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,345
and bring you home with us in my pocket.

583
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:53,082
But since that's impossible...
Is that impossible?

584
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,318
Since that's probably impossible,

585
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,187
my only wish is for everyone
to sign my scrapbook.

586
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:02,025
I'll never forget you guys.
Wait.

587
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,130
Now I'll never forget you guys!

588
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:15,338
I now officially declare you:
technically teenagers.

589
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,974
Welcome to Angst and Acne Forever.

590
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,909
<i>One of us! One of us!</i>

591
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,211
- Whoo-hee!
- Whoopee!

592
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,915
- So how do you feel?
- Samey, but differenty.

593
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,083
<i>Hey, you two.</i>

594
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,985
When are you gonna open
your presents already?

595
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,843
- I broke a nail wrapping them.
- Ha ha! Pacifica.

596
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,927
Stanley, I need to talk to you.

597
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,996
I didn't want to say anything
with everyone listening,

598
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,931
but we've got a problem.

599
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,534
Weirdmageddon has been
contained, but I'm detecting

600
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,103
some strange new anomalies
near the Arctic Ocean.

601
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,337
I want to go investigate it,

602
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,174
but I think I might be
too old to go it alone.

603
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,342
Are you sayin' you
need someone to help you

604
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,212
sail around the world on
the adventure of a lifetime?

605
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,916
<i>I don't just want someone
to come with me, Stanley.</i>

606
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,084
<i>I want it to be you.</i>

607
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,086
<i>Will you give me a second chance?</i>

608
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,189
You think we'll find treasure?
And babes?

609
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,025
Heh!
I'd say there's a high probability!

610
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,993
But what should we do
with the Mystery Shack?

611
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,930
<i>I think the town's
had enough mystery for one lifetime.</i>

612
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,082
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

613
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,138
Everyone, I have an
announcement to make.

614
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,941
Me and my... Heh!...
nerdy bro over here

615
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,276
have some catchin' up to do,
we're gonna be away for a while.

616
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:30,980
That's why I'm shutting down
the Mystery Shack for good!

617
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,839
You shut down your mouth for good!

618
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,188
I'm sorry, Mr. Pineses,

619
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,958
it's just that this shack is
the most magical place on Earth.

620
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,094
Sure, the attractions are all fake,
but dreams aren't fake.

621
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,081
Like this mermaid:
It's not just a dead fish butt

622
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:51,033
sewn to a monkey carcass,
it's a marvelous creature

623
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,236
that makes us believe
that anything is possible.

624
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,639
You shut down this shack,
and you shut down our dreams!

625
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,942
At least... my dreams.

626
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,177
<i>Aw.</i>

627
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:07,183
I'm sorry, Soos, it's just
there's no one around to run it.

628
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,285
At least there wouldn't be

629
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,188
if I hadn't just found
the perfect replacement.

630
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,928
Ladies and gentlemen, the Mystery Shack
is under new management!

631
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,298
You... You mean it, Mister Mystery?

632
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:26,936
You're Mister Mystery now, Soos.
Try not to burn the place down.

633
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:30,072
I'll move in immediately.

634
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,094
Do you really have to go?

635
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,096
There is still so much
we haven't done together.

636
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,100
Summer's over, Candy.
It's time for us to grow up.

637
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,869
But not too much.

638
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,072
I hate my dumb heart
for making me feel things!

639
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,176
- Cut. It. Out. Heart!
- Hey, can you punch my heart too?

640
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,146
No, mine!
Punch my feelings away!

641
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,918
Candy and Grenda,
thank you for being my people.

642
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,287
You'll always be my best friends.

643
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:21,857
Grunkle Stan, thanks for
wearing my Goodbye sweater.

644
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,093
Ah, it's cold out. I had to.

645
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,295
What? But it's, like,
eighty-something degrees out today.

646
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,238
<i>Can it, Soos!</i>

647
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:37,907
- Hey. You mean a lot to me, man.
- You too.

648
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:45,214
Something to remember me by.
Oh, and this.

649
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,177
Read it the next time
you miss Gravity Falls.

650
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,359
Last bus leaving Gravity Falls.
All aboard.

651
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:01,197
Guess we said goodbye to
everyone except... Waddles.

652
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,334
I... don't know how to
explain this, but...

653
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,338
Mom and Dad won't let me bring
a pig home to California, so...

654
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,074
you have to stay here!

655
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,915
Come on, come on!
I have to go.

656
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,951
I'm... I'm sorry, Waddles!

657
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,154
Ah! You know what?
Forget it!

658
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,058
I lived with this pig all summer,
now your parents are gonna have to!

659
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,395
Hey, bus guy!
This pig is coming with the kids!

660
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,998
Now, hold on a second. Bringing
animals aboard a moving vehicle

661
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,037
is strictly prohibited by...

662
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,205
Wah... W-Welcome aboard.

663
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,727
You can sit in the front row, pig.

664
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:51,113
Kids, you knuckleheads
were nothin' but a nuisance

665
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,513

666
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,421
We'll miss you too, Grunkle Stan.

667
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:08,297
- Ready to head into the unknown?
- Nope.

668
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,266
Let's do it.

669
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,166
- Bye! Bye, everybody!
- I'll miss you guys too!

673
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,173

677
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,989

00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,434

- I don't see why not.

All right, all right. I tell ya,

42
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,816
it's unnatural for siblings
to get along as well as you do.

43

still got plenty of summer left

00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:19,276
Heh... yeah...
plenty of summer left.

46
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:22,996
Kids, there's something I, uh...
something I should tell you.

47
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,116
It's, um...
W-well, it's complicated.

48
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,001
I...

49
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,870
I'm gonna go refresh my soda.

50
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:34,124
Enjoy it while you can, Stan.
They'll find out sooner or later.

51

Hey, hands off, you stooge!

60
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,293
 I don't understand!

61
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:13,997
What did I do that warrants
this much arresting?

62
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,085
The government guys?
I thought you got eaten by zombies.

63
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:23,006
- We survived... barely.
- I used Trigger as a human shield.

64
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,842
- He cried like a baby.
- Wha... Hey!

65
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,177
Not in front of the special ops guys.

66
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:30,313
This is security footage of
a government waste facility.

67
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:35,018
<i>At 0400 hours last night, someone
robbed 300 gallons of dangerous waste.</i>

68
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,319
What? You think that's me?

69
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,271
Don't play dumb with us, Pines!

70
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:41,157
But I actually am dumb!
Last night I was restocking

71
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:44,450
- the gift shop... I swear!
- Wait, Grunkle Stan!

72
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,938
You've got the wrong guy!
Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift

73
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,334
the occasional tangerine, but
he's not some evil supervillain.

74
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,337
Listen, kid. We've been
watching your family all summer,

75
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,256
and we've seen some disturbing things,

76
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,159
but nothing as dangerous as
what your uncle is hiding.

77
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:02,796
Somewhere hidden in this
shack is a doomsday device!

78
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,049
Trigger, you take the children.

79
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,052
I'll talk to the old man.
Sorry to break it to you, kids,

80
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,137
but you don't know your uncle at all.

81
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,341
- Icee pop, clear!
- Hey!

82
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,551
Kids! You gotta believe me!

83
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:28,238

Stanford Pines, you stand accused
of theft of government waste,

88
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,741
conspiracy, and possession
of illegal weapons.

89
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,660
How do you plead to these charges?

90
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,746
Uh... "guiltoccent."
I mean, "innoguilty."

91
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,499
Um...
Can I have my phone call?

92
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:07,421
Okay, give me whatever you
got that comes with a free toy.

<i>Soos!</i>

94
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,842
Mr. Pines? Is this some
sort of possession situation?

<i>Soos, pick up!</i>

96
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,729
Mr. Pines, what happened?
I heard you got arrested or something?

97
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:17,397
I had to go get some panic food.

98
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,732
<i>Listen, I need something from you.</i>

99
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,684
You know that vending
machine in the gift shop?

100
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,853
<i>I need you to guard it with your life.</i>

101
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,439
<i>No matter what happens,
no matter who talks to you,</i>

102
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,357
<i>don't let them touch that machine!</i>

103
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:33,363

00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,055
Let's do this.

107
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,546
<i>We've got Mr. Pines in custody.</i>

108
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,465

<i>You take care of those kids.</i>

110
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,552
What are you gonna do to us?

111
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:58,555
- We'll be taking you to child services.
- Boo!

112
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,774
In the meantime, enjoy
some mindless reality TV...

<i>You're watching Ker-Prank'd

Dipper, this is crazy.

118
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:15,539
There's no way Stan was
stealing hazardous waste.

119
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,501
- We gotta clear his name!
- Hmm...

120
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:22,629
Wait a minute, the security tapes!

121
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,549
Didn't Stan say he was restocking
the gift shop last night?

122
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,467
If we could get the Mystery
Shack's surveillance tapes,

123
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:28,752
we could prove he's innocent!

124
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,838
We just need to think
of a way out of here.

125
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,591
Think, Mabel. Think.

126
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,593
No!

127
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,578
Oh oh oh...

- Yes!

00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,508
Backup! Requesting backup!

131
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,680
Come on, Dipper. We're gonna
go clear our uncle's name.

132
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,716
Oh, you poor kids. You really
think your uncle's innocent?

133
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,803
<i>I've seen it all before.
False names, double lives.</i>

134
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,638

135
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,723
<i>The next, they're
building doomsday devices.</i>

136
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,809
<i>Your uncle scammed the whole world.</i>

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,217
<i>You gonna let him scam you, too?</i>

138
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:31,648
You... You don't know
what you're talking about.

139
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,567
<i>You're gonna regret this!</i>

140
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:50,842
Only five more hours till it happens.
I gotta be there!

141
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,420
Come on, Stan,
you gotta think of a way out of this.

142
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:54,671
Think! Think!

143
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,590
Huh?

144
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:06,566
They're getting stronger!
Of course, that's it!

145
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:11,688
H-hey! Whoa!

146
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,357
Is it just me, or did the
entire world just hiccup?

147
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,610
I'm sure it's just
a baby-sized earthquake.

148
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:18,695
Aww, baby-sized!

149
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,500
It's happening!
The end times!

150
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:26,703
When that machine activates,
I gotta get outta town!

151
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:30,707
Git in there, raccoon wife, git!

152
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,427
Eh?

153
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,078
<i>All right, here's the plan.
 I'll take out those</i>

154
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,605
<i>two guard guys, you karate-chop
the other dude in the neck,</i>

155
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,607
and then we'll back-flip
through the front door!

156
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,477
Mabel, aren't you forgetting
the simpler solution?

157
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,528
Oh, right.

158
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:56,495
- So is it a rock, or is it a face?
- I think... it's a metaphor.

159
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,548
All right. If I was Stan,

160
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,883
where would I hide
those surveillance tapes?

161
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,841
Wait! The Antelabbit!

162
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,593
Don't you mean "jackalope"?

163
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,860
Pfft! That can't be right.

164
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,766
<i>Yes!</i>

165
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,033
<i> It's this week! 
This is it!</i>

166
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:35,772
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

167
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,608
Someone yelled "Wormy Dance."
We had to!

168
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,693
Fast-forward.

169
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,864
<i>Ha! There it is!
Stan restocking, like he said.</i>

170
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,585
And the date shows it was last night!
It's proof! He's innocent!

171
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,252
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, maybe he's just

172
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:01,214
going to the bathroom outdoors,
the way nature intended.

173
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,388
<i>Oh, no. Stan, you didn't!</i>

174
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,391
Don't panic. That could
be anyone in that suit.

175
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:13,777
<i>Hot Belgian waffles!</i>

176
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:18,481
<i>Wait, I'm alone. I can
swear for real! Son-of-a... </i>

177
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,867
That's him, all right.

178
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:25,488
Okay, okay. So maybe Grunkle
Stan stole some toxic waste.

179
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,491
That doesn't mean he's leading
a nefarious double life.

180
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,511
Mabel, I'm not so sure about that.

181
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,800
What? What is all this?

182
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,835
Stetson Pinefield?

183
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,722
Hal Forrester?
Andrew "8-Ball" Alcatraz?

184
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,200
These are fake IDs, Mabel!
You wouldn't need these

185
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,644
unless you were trying to
hide your real identity.

186
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,596
But why would Stan do that?

187
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,521
What?

188
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,607
<i>"Stan Pines Dead"?</i>

189
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,859
<i>"Foul play
suspected in Pines' death."</i>

190
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:07,107
"Fiery car crash, brakes cut... "
By who?

191
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,785
<i>"Unnamed grifter at large"?</i>

192
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,471
Why would they call him "unnamed"?

193
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:17,374
- Unless Stan...
- ... isn't...

194
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>Stan?!</i>

195
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,708
<i>Stan Pines is dead? </i>

196
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,795
Then who have we been living with?
It doesn't make any sense!

197
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,547
There has to be some explanation.

198
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,701
Maybe we're getting Ker-Pranked!
Justin Ker-Prank is gonna

199
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:40,479
jump up from behind one of
these plants, any minute now!

200
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,774
Any minute, Justin.

201
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,477
Can't believe it! This whole summer
I've been looking for answers,

202
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,863
and the biggest mystery
was right under our nose.

203
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,816
There's gotta be some kind of
explanation in here, somewhere.

204
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:55,653
What the... ?
"Secret Code to Hideout"?

205
00:12:55,704 --> 00:13:00,374
Let me see that!
A1, B, C3...

206
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:03,544
- I've never seen a code like this.
- Wait, I have!

207
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,663
Dipper, it's the vending machine!

208
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,720
All right, Pines.
Play time is over.

209
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,423
Chopper's ready to
dust off to Washington.

210
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:17,425
I'll enjoy putting you away.

211
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:19,727
What? Um, can't we stick
around for maybe one minute,

212
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,762
uh, one minute, thirty seconds?

213
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,765
We're not falling for your games, Pines.

214
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:29,603
You've been running your whole life.
Your time is finally up.

215
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,772
Bathroom break?
Just gimme 15 seconds.

216
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,408
Sorry, but you've got a flight to catch.

217
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:40,831
Oh, yeah? So do you!

218
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,616
Huh?

219
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,707
Whoa, whoa, hey!

220
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,799
Hey!
Dang it, get back here!

221
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,551
<i>Men, get him!</i>

222
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:06,640
No!
 You won't get away with this!

223
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,529
Gonna get ya! Gonna get ya!

224
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,647
<i>Ow!</i>

225
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,783
Whoa!

226
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,818
- You know where the Mystery Shack is?
- Uh, yeah.

227
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,537
Okay, here's a hundred bucks.

228
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,455
Drive as far away from
the Shack as possible,

229
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,657
and don't stop when the
cops start chasing you!

230
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,580
<i>He's getting away!</i>

231
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,500
Obviously, follow that cab!

232
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,670
Stanford escaped! He's at large!

233
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:39,673
We need to sweep the town!
Move, move, move!

234
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,522
All right, Soos, remember the plan.

235
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,440
Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust,

236
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:58,692
legally get adopted by Stan,
change name to Stan Junior.

237
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,529
- Soos!
- Oh, kids, where have you been?

238
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:02,830
W-what are you doing here?

239
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,832
Stan gave me a mission
to protect this machine.

240
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,418
Ha!
And I thought I loved snacks!

241
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,587
Soos, listen.
Something huge is going on here.

242
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:13,424
If Stan is hiding some dangerous secret,
we need to find out what it is!

243
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,544
- I need you to step aside.
- Yeah, just let us through

244
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,630
so we can prove this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

245
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,425
Guys, I know this seems crazy,

246
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:24,043
but I promised Stan I would
guard this with my life.

247
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:27,471
I'm sorry, Soos.

248
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:30,558
Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!

249
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,775
- Please, Soos!
- C'mon, Soos!

250
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,445
Aw, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys!

251
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,564
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

252
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,651
Seriously, it hurts me
way more than it hurts you.

253
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:51,462
Ohh...

254
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,886
It's like something from a video game.

255
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,389
- Or a dream.
- Or a nightmare.

256
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,763
I gotta be there when it happens!

257
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,292
Guys, are we dreaming?
Somebody wake me up.

258
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,260
This... can't be real.

259
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,430
I don't understand. Why
would Mr. Pines have all this?

260
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,599
It's just like that bunker in the woods.

261
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,352
But what is it doing
underneath the Mystery Shack?

262
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:35,272
Okay, okay, so he's got
a huge, gigantic lab.

263
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:36,640
That doesn't mean anything bad.

264
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,442
Everyone's got secrets!

265
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,645
It's still Stan, and he loves us.

266
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:46,367
- And we love him, right?
- Can't be... it's impossible.

267
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,569
<i>The other two journals?!</i>

268
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,572
All this time, all this time,
Stan had them?!

269
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,542
I can't believe it!
Was anything he said to us real?!

270
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:57,578
- Why would he have those journals?!
- Maybe he's the author.

271
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,547
Or maybe he stole them from the author!

272
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:01,632
Maybe the reason he has
all of those fake IDs

273
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,584
is because he is a master criminal,

274
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,617
<i>and this machine is his master plan!</i>

275
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:13,394
Whoa!

276
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,565
"I was wrong the whole time."

277
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,601
<i>"The machine was meant to create
knowledge, but it is too powerful!"</i>

278
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,653
"I was deceived, and now it is too late!"

279
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,038
<i>- "The device, if fully operational,"
- "could tear our universe apart!"</i>

280
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,328
"It must not fall into the wrong hands.

281
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:34,615
"If the clock ever reaches zero,
our universe is doomed."

282
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:41,194
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!

283
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,460
The agents were right!
We have to shut it down!

284
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,639
There! Quick!

285
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,394
Turn these! Together!

286
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,531
That's it!
The shutdown switch!

287
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:13,571
This all stops now!

288
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:18,208
<i>Don't touch that button!</i>

289
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,631
Dipper, just back away.

290
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,669
Please don't press that shutdown
button. You gotta trust me.

291
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,421
And I should trust you, why?

292
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:34,308
After you stole radioactive waste,
after you lied to us all summer!

293
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:37,561
- I don't even know who you are!
- Look, I know this all seems nuts,

294
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:41,231
but I need that machine to stay on.
If you just let me explain...

295
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:44,085
Oh! Oh, no!
Brace yourselves!

296
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:53,694
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

297
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:05,205
<i>T-minus 35 seconds.</i>

298
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:09,376
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

299
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:10,544
<i>Dipper!</i>

300
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,632
Mabel! Hurry!
Shut it down!

301
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,470
No!

302
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:22,473
Mabel, Mabel, wait!
Stop!

303
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,642
Soos, what are you doing?
I gave you an order!

304
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,227
Sorry, Mr. Pines,
if that is your real name,

305
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:30,230
but I have a new mission now,
protecting these kids!

306
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,616
Soos, you idiot, let me go!

307
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,570
- Let me go! C'mon!
- Mabel, press the red button!

308
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:39,490
- Shut it down!
- No, you can't! You gotta trust me!

309
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:44,495
Grunkle Stan, I don't even
know if you're my Grunkle!

310
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:46,463
I wanna believe you, but...

311
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,253
Then listen to me.
Remember this morning,

312
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,352
when I said I wanted to
tell you guys something?

313
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,553
<i>T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

314
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,592
I wanted to say that you're gonna
hear some bad things about me,

315
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:02,346
and some of 'em are true, but trust
me, everything I've worked for,

316
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:05,349
everything I care about,
it's all for this family.

317
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,684
Mabel, what if he's lying?

318
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,570
This thing could destroy the universe!
Listen to your head!

319
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,405
<i>Look into my eyes, Mabel!</i>

320
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,273
You really think I'm a bad guy?

321
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,693
He's lying!
Shut it down, now!

322
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,760
<i>- Mabel, please!
- Ten, nine... </i>

323
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,334
Grunkle Stan...

324
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:25,536
<i>Six, five... </i>

325
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,374
I trust you.

326
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,543
Mabel, are you crazy?!
We're all gonna...

327
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,381
<i>One.</i>

328
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,715
Nooo!

329
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,138
W-What? Who is that?

330
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,557
The author of the journals...

331
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:25,062
<i>... my brother.</i>

332
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:29,999
- Is this the part where one of us faints?
- Oh, I am so on it, dude.

1
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,479
Thirty long years
and it's all led up to this.

2
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,080
My greatest achievement!

3
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,183
Probably
should have worn pants.

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,487
Agh!

5
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,491
Feisty, I like it.

6
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:55,237
If I finally pull this off, it
will all have been worth it.

7
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,644
I just need to keep
playing it cool.

8
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,047
If anyone ever finds out
about this...

9
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:11,086
Yeah, right.
I've come this far.

10
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,355
Who could possibly
catch me now?

11
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,204
<i>See there, there it is again.</i>

12
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:32,274
<i>We haven't seen
readings like this for 30 years.</i>

13
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:35,677
<i>Is it coming from deep space?
An enemy weapons site?</i>

14
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,414
<i>Just as I suspected.</i>

15
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,351
Gentlemen, we're going
<i>to Gravity Falls.</i>

16
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,466
Oh, right.
Show time.

17
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,603
<i>Welcome to the grand
re-opening of the Mystery Shack!</i>

18
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,205
Mystery Shack!

19
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:40,561
We're here to celebrate the defeat
of that skunk little Gideon.

20
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,043
Boo!

21
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,612
Please, please, boo harder.

22
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,380
Boo!

23
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,182
But I didn't catch
that pork chop all alone.

24
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,618
These two scams deserve
some of the glory.

25
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,686
Oh!
Okay, okay.

26
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,021
Most of the glory.

27
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:55,257
Smile for the camera.

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,092
Your camera's
a cinder block, Toby.

29
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,995
I just want to be
a part of things.

30
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:01,696
Smile for a real camera.

31
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,698
Everyone say
"something stupid."

32
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,101
Something stupid!

33
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,371
And don't forget to come to the
after party tonight at 8:00.

34
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,506
We're doing
a karaoke bonanza, people.

35
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,643
Lights! Music! Enchantment!
Phoo!

36
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,933
And an amazing karaoke
performance by our family band,

37
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,314
Love Patrol Alpha.

38
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:20,715
Oh, I don't know about that.

39
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,350
I would never
agree to that ever.

40
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,952
Too late, I wrote your names
on the list.

41
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:24,686
It's happening.

42
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:27,556
Buy your ticket, people.

43
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:30,192
You know you don't have anything
else going on in your lives.

44
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,726
I'm talking to you, pizza guy.

45
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,662
Don't lame out on me.

46
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,530
Ha!
The town loves us.

47
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,732
We finally got that Gideon
smell out of the carpet.

48
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,168
Everything
is finally going my way.

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,370
Hey, Grunkle Stan,
now that we have a moment,

50
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,673
I've been meaning to ask you
for my journal back.

51
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,008
What? Journal?

52
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,311
Oh, you mean this old thing?

53
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,680
It was so boring
I couldn't even finish it.

54
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,619
You didn't see nothing.

55
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,387
Wait, you're just gonna
give it to me?

56
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,223
Just like that?

57
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,905
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?

58
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,392
I-- I got to go.

59
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,027
Whoa!

60
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,429
I wouldn't mind
a kiss on the cheek.

61
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,587
Not gonna happen.

62
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,704
Mabel, we've got to talk.

63
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,372
Almost losing my journal
made me realize

64
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,074
that I'm halfway
through the summer

65
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,709
and still no closer
to figuring out

66
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,444
the big mysteries
of Gravity Falls.

67
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:24,012
Gideon almost
destroyed the town

68
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,294
to get his hands
on this journal.

69
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,048
But why?
Who wrote it?

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,617
Where are
all the other journals?

71
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:32,120
What was Bill talking about when he
said everything was going to change?

72
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:34,723
There's something huge
going on right under our noses.

73
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:38,326
And it's time we stop goofing
around and get to the bottom of it.

74
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,609
Bro, you've looked at that
thing, like, a bazillion times.

75
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,264
There's nothing
left to discover.

76
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,132
Half the pages are blank,
remember?

77
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,803
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece
away from figuring out everything.

78
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,372
Don't worry, Dipper.

79
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,741
Lord Mystery Ham
is on the case.

80
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:55,076
"I play by me own rules!
What? What?"

81
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,279
I don't know
why I tell you things.

82
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,346
Do you hear that?

83
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,353
Hey, Mr. Pines,
what's that code word

84
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,435
I'm supposed to yell
when I see a government vehicle?

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?

86
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,098
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,235
I will not hesitate to use
the hose on the elderly.

88
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,736
Uncle Stan, what's happening?

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,672
Yeah, you never
shut down the gift shop.

90
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,476
Welcome to the Mystery Shack,
gentlemen.

91
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:29,678
What can I get you?
Key chains?

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,446
Snow globes?

93
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,282
These rare
photos of American Presidents?

94
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:35,784
My name is Agent Powers.

95
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,118
This is Agent Trigger.

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,689
We're here to investigate reports of
mysterious activity in this town.

97
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,424
Activity.

98
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,793
Mysterious activity
in the Mystery Shack?

99
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:45,860
You got to be joking.

100
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,696
I assure you I am not.

101
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,664
I was born with a rare disorder
that makes me

102
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,100
physically incapable
of experiencing humor.

103
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,605
I don't understand that sound
you're making with your mouth.

104
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,674
Now if you'll excuse us, we're
conducting an investigation.

105
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,276
Investigation.

106
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,711
Wait, wait.

107
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,513
Did you guys say you're investigating
the mysteries of this town?

108
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,749
That information is classified.

109
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,883
But, yes.

110
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,785
Look, between you and me,

111
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,854
I believe there is a conspiracy
of paranormal origin

112
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,689
all connected to this town.

113
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,891
We're just one small lead away
from blowing

114
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,227
the lid off this
entire mystery.

115
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,795
Are you kidding me?

116
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,497
I'm investigating
the exact same thing.

117
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,834
I found this journal in the woods
which has almost all the answers.

118
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:28,370
If we work together,
we could crack the case.

119
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:34,275
If you have evidence of these
claims, we should talk.

120
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,845
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.

121
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,647
I have so much to show you.

122
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,482
I'm sorry, agents.

123
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,219
Kid has an overactive imagination
and, like, a sweating problem.

124
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,654
Zing!

125
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,537
Paranormal town stuff,
it's just part of gift shop lore.

126
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,558
Sells more tickets, you know.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,693
Pop-poro-po-po.

128
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,862
Swag.

129
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,730
We have other spots
to investigate.

130
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,332
We'll be on our way.

131
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,694
I'm confiscating
this for evidence.

132
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,668
Smart move.

133
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,336
Wait!
No, wait!

134
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,538
We have so much to talk about.

135
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,239
Hold it, kiddo.

136
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:07,442
Trust me, the last thing you want
around here in a party is cops.

137
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,444
I'm confiscating that card.

138
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,312
And how's about
you go be a normal kid?

139
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,314
Flirt with a girl,
or steal a pie off a windowsill.

140
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,949
But, Grunkle Stan,
you don't understand.

141
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,218
And don't go talking
to those agents.

142
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,889
That could have
been my big break.

143
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,924
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan
is right.

144
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,759
We're throwing
a party tonight.

145
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,661
Can't you go one night
without searching

146
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,897
for aliens or raising
the dead or whatever?

147
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,832
I'm not gonna raise the dead.

148
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,794
I just need a chance to show
those agents my book.

149
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,502
Trust me, Dipper.

150
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,504
The only book you'll need
tonight is right here.

151
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,706
Boo!

152
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,510
I say "kara," you say "oke."
Kara...

153
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,513
Kara...
Kara...

154
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,816
I could do this all day.

155
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,554
Agh!

156
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,796
Well, the confetti
cannon works.

157
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,792
And the karaoke machine
has all the best songs.

158
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,928
"We built this township
on rock and roll."

159
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,063
"Danger lane
to highway town."

160
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,966
"Taking over midnight"
by AmperSandra.

161
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,469
Listen, kid, you do not want
to hear this voice singing.

162
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,370
Trust me.

163
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,307
Grunkle Stan, karaoke
isn't about sounding good.

164
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,009
It's about
sounding terrible, together.

165
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,380
Check it out! These black lights
make my teeth look scary.

166
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,618
It's like a crime scene
in my mouth.

167
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,919
Come on, you'll love it.

168
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,654
It's not fair.

169
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,690
Finally I meet someone
who can help me

170
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,459
solve the mysteries of this town
and Stan confiscates their card.

171
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,301
Dude, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this,

172
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:36,965
but I'm pretty sure Stan hides
like everything in his room.

173
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,968
If I go into Stan's room,
I could get in so much trouble.

174
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,536
Yeah, you're probably right.

175
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,471
That's what
makes it fun, dummy.

176
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:47,609
Man, I can't wait to smash
these Stanatas.

177
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,410
Smash!

178
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,312
Grenda has entered the party!

179
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,014
Stan's brains look delicious.

180
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,482
Girls!

181
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,285
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!

182
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,953
Is that a boom box sweater?

183
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,388
See for yourself.

184
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,689
Poke!

185
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:05,293
Yeah, yeah!
Work it! Ah!

186
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,830
Aw!

187
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,698
I thought this was
gonna be a rave.

188
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,001
Thompson, take off your shirt
and make it a rave.

189
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:16,337
I'll do anything
for your approval.

190
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,772
Oh, come on.

191
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,407
I promise I won't
send it to anyone.

192
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:24,345
Who's got one good eye
and one good pie?

193
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,847
These kegs are full of meat.

194
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,918
Tambry sends me
the craziest text.

195
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,688
The whole town is showing up and
no sign of those pesky agents.

196
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,057
Wendy, Dipper, how are those
posters coming along?

197
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,761
Hmm.

198
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,499
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.

199
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,221
You go rustle through
his weird old man biz.

200
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,975
All right, Grunkle Stan,
where did you hide that card?

201
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,043
Nothing.

202
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,511
Nothing.

203
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,579
Nothing.

204
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,615
Ew!

205
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,050
Pretending I never saw that.

206
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,485
Wait a minute.

207
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,555
Yes!

208
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:09,991
I got it!

209
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,429
<i>Agent Powers.</i>

210
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,097
Hi, this is Dipper.

211
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:19,534
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the
one with the, um, sweating problem.

212
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,569
I have that journal
I wanted to show you.

213
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,771
<i>And you're certain this journal
will help our case?</i>

214
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,473
I'm 100% positive.

215
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,842
<i>Very well.
We're on our way.</i>

216
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,613
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.

217
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,548
Kid, why did you call
those agents?

218
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,270
I've told you once,
I've told you 100 times,

219
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,820
there's nothing supernatural
going on in Gravity Falls.

220
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,455
Yes, there is.

221
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:43,558
After everything that's happened,
you have to know that by now.

222
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,693
All I know
is that your dumb obsession

223
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,096
is gonna get us all in trouble
one of these days.

224
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,164
Now go enjoy
the rest of the party,

225
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,700
'cause when it's over,
you're grounded.

226
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,940
Hmm.

227
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:08,116
Hey, boys, looking good!

228
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,851
Gorney, you clean up nice.

229
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,420
Mr. Poolcheck,
move those crazy legs.

230
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,056
You-- You weird pool man.

231
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,891
What's the problem, officers?

232
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,561
Did you catch my face
going 90 smiles per hour?

233
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:23,131
We've got complaints about
the loudest party in town.

234
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,999
Three words.

235
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,067
We want in.

236
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,471
Welcome to your dreams.

237
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,012
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.

238
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,950
Working together, we can crack all
the big questions of Gravity Falls.

239
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,485
Trust me, this book is the lead
you've been looking for.

240
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,220
I'm thinking
full-scale investigation.

241
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,855
Forensics, researchers.

242
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,157
Do you guys have a helicopter?

243
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,527
I'm sorry, "helicopters".

244
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,163
Kid, I'd love to believe you,
but this just looks like

245
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,065
more junk
from your uncle's gift shop.

246
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,033
I mean, "leprecorn"?

247
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,636
I can't be the only one
that thinks that it's not funny.

248
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,738
I can confirm.
Not funny.

249
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,573
No, it's real, I swear.

250
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,141
You should
"send it to the lab".

251
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,143
Am I saying that right?

252
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,305
Your uncle was right about
that overactive imagination.

253
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,214
We've got paperwork to do, kid.

254
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,949
- Boring paperwork.
- Wait!

255
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,584
This book is real.

256
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,186
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!

257
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,654
Listen!
Uh...

258
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,189
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!

259
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,692
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!

260
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:28,997
Huh?

261
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,098
Huh?

262
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:42,210
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.

263
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,112
Spooky journal, 100% real.

264
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,646
Now can we work together?

265
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,216
- Mother of all that is holy.
- What do we do?

266
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,084
It's just one zombie.

267
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,953
Trust me, I see stuff like this
all the time.

268
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:57,966
Good thing
it was just that one.

269
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?

270
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,036
Kid, we've been chasing
the paranormal for years,

271
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,271
but we've never seen
anything like this before.

272
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,572
Get down!

273
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,846
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?

274
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:23,651
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪

275
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,788
♪ Making all that money
and getting them girls ♪

276
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,589
Oh!

277
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,692
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?

278
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,995
When I say Mabel,
you say Pines.

279
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,164
Mabel!

280
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,665
Mabel!

281
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,267
We're all gonna die!

282
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:40,269
Why does that never work?

283
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,070
Whoa, whoa.

284
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,871
I think it's an earthquake.

285
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:46,007
Hey, everybody, we got
to get out of here!

286
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,575
We're all doomed.

287
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,776
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!

288
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,280
Mabel,
escape while you still can!

289
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,282
Wait! No!
Don't leave!

290
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,018
You haven't even done
our family karaoke song yet.

291
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,660
Dipper, what's the one thing
I asked you not to do tonight?

292
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,128
Raise the dead.

293
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,630
- And what did you do?
- Raise the dead.

294
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,202
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.

295
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,208
Sorry, one second.

296
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,437
You've got to admit
this is pretty cool.

297
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,317
Zombies!

298
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,819
Don't panic. Maybe they're just
a really ugly flash mob.

299
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,957
Dudes, stay calm.

300
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,659
I've been training for
this moment my whole life.

301
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,394
With all the horror movies
I've seen,

302
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,280
I know literally everything there is
to know about how to avoid zombies.

303
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,402
Second thought,
gonna flip the script.

304
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,739
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?

305
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,341
Seeing some yay faces
over here.

306
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,449
Quick, the golf cart.

307
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,786
Oh, come on.

308
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,908
That's a bummer.

309
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,156
Good news for me though.

310
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,857
Soos!

311
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:12,293
Sorry, dude, I just really
want those brains.

312
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:13,361
Stay back!

313
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,003
Give it up, dudes.

314
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,871
Your fighting only makes us
look more rad.

315
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,007
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?

316
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,775
How's he supposed to help?

317
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,497
He doesn't even believe
in the supernatural.

318
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,948
Those agents
could ruin everything.

319
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,349
Darn kid!

320
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,084
He has no idea
what he's messing with.

321
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,021
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.

322
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,823
Sort of like me, I suppose.

323
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,196
I got too much on my mind to
worry about those kids right now.

324
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,430
All right, let's see.

325
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,938
Take that, sucker!

326
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,477
This thing's a surprisingly
good weapon.

327
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,948
We need to board up
all the windows.

328
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:15,223
Okay,
maybe that will hold them.

329
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,258
- Oh!
- Hi, dudes.

330
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,620
By the way, I taught the zombies
how to get to the fuse box.

331
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,278
Among these dudes
I'm like a genius.

332
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,764
Get those brains, dog.

333
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,871
Dipper, isn't there something in the
journal about defeating zombies?

334
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,174
No! There's nothing in here
about weaknesses.

335
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,042
This can't be happening.

336
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,445
I wanted answers so bad
I put everyone in danger.

337
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,180
Now we're toast.

338
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,215
It's all my fault
and no one can save us.

339
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,085
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!

340
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Dipper!

341
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,465
You two, attic, now!

342
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,066
Grunkle-- Grunkle Stan?

343
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,468
I said now!

344
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,305
All right, you undead jerks,
you ready to die twice?

345
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:09,510
The only wrinkly monster
who harasses my family is me.

346
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,511
Take that!

347
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,213
And that!

348
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,317
Beat it, no-eyes.

349
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,489
Anyone else want a piece?

350
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,076
Oh! Ow!

351
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,444
Everything hurts.

352
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:45,246
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!

353
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:46,347
Are you all right?

354
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,385
Well, at least, you can't deny
magic exists anymore, right?

355
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,054
Kid, I've always known.

356
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,955
Wait.
What are you talking about?

357
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,857
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.

358
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,160
Of course, this town is weird
and the one thing

359
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,595
I know about that weirdness
is that it's dangerous.

360
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,867
I've been lying about it to try
to keep you away from it,

361
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,569
to try to protect you from it.

362
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,909
It looks like I didn't lie
well enough.

363
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,080
What do we do?
What do we do?

364
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,548
Normally,
the journal would help us,

365
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,630
but there's nothing in there
about defeating zombies.

366
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:23,984
It's hopeless.

367
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,553
Wait, wait, wait, the text!

368
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,388
It's glowing
in the black light.

369
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,489
What?

370
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
All this time I thought
I knew all the journal secrets.

371
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,229
But they're written
in some kind of invisible ink.

372
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,397
Invisible ink?

373
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,598
This is it.

374
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,300
"Zombies have a weakness!

375
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,369
Previously thought
to be invincible,

376
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,904
their skulls can be shattered by
a perfect three part harmony."

377
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:46,107
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?

378
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,175
I have a naturally
high pitched scream.

379
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,911
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.

380
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,580
Boys, boys.

381
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,516
I think you're both missing
the obvious solution.

382
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,488
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

383
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,089
<i>Does this seem loud?</i>

384
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,327
Oh, <i>Gossiping Housewives</i> is on.

385
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,230
Eh, I already sat down.

386
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,138
Zombies and gentlemen,
I'm Mable,

387
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,507
they're Dipper and Stan
and together,

388
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,543
we are Love Patrol Alpha!

389
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,665
I never agreed to that name.

390
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,979
Hit it!

391
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,620

Thank you!

We'll be here all night!

420
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,466
Deal with it, zombie idiots!

421
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,702
Pines! Pines!

422
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,103
Pines! Pines!

423
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,741
I'm sorry about this, guys.

424
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,776
I totally ruined everything.

425
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,478
Dipper, are you kidding me?

426
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,182
I got to sing karaoke with my two
favorite people in the world.

427
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,451
No party could ever top that.

428
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:13,153
Kids, listen,
this town is crazy.

429
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,722
So you need to be careful.

430
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,758
I don't know what I'd do with
myself if you got hurt on my watch.

431
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,194
I'll let you hold
onto that spooky journal

432
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,129
as long as you promise me
you'll only use it

433
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:25,165
for self-defense
and not go looking for trouble.

434
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,201
Okay, as long as
you promise me

435
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,205
that you don't have any other
bombshell secrets about this town.

436
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,239
Promise.

437
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,474
Promise.

438
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,745
Man, we have got a lot of
zombie damage to clean up.

439
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,079
Where's my handyman anyway?

440
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,749
Brains! Brains!

441
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:42,816
Holy Moses!

442
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,752
Wait!

443
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,754
There's a page in here about
curing zombification.

444
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,756
It's gonna
take a lot of formaldehyde.

445
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,391
Ooh, and cinnamon.

446
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,792
Come on, Soos,
let's fix you up.

447
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,228
Brains! Brains!

448
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,429
Soos, cut it out!

449
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,630
Sorry, dude.

450
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,365
I can't believe it.

451
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,368
All this time the author's secrets
were hiding in plain sight.

452
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,671
A whole new chapter
of mysteries to explore.

453
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,376
That was insane.

454
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,078
I've never seen
anything like it.

455
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,313
Who do we report to?

456
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,117
This is bigger than
we imagined.

457
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,819
We need to bring in
the big guns.

458
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,387
But they'll never believe us.

459
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,122
Then we'll make them
believe us.

460
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,792
This is the town
we've been searching for.

461
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,627
Ba-- Ba-- Bam.

462
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,329
Another zombie!

463
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,851
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop your weapon!

464
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,533
Oh, okay,
it's just--

465
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,335
- Who is that guy?
- A very ugly man.
