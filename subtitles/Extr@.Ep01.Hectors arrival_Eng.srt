1
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:13,900
Hector.
Yes.

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,780
 Please could you pass the salt? 

3
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,200
Yes. 

4
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,171
Hector. 
Yes. 

5
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:33,645
Please could you pass the pepper? 

6
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:37,000
Of course. 

7
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,600
Hector. 

8
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,150
Let me guess. Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea. 

9
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:54,654
Actually I was going to say we should talk. 

10
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,870
So now you want to talk to me! 

11
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:00,350
It's only been a week! 

12
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,950
I was hurt! 

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,668
Well you hurt me too. 

14
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,669
I didn't go out with Eunice! 

15
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,100
I didn't go out with Eunice! 

16
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:12,300
Yes you did! And you stayed out 'till three o'clock in the morning! 

17
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:18,230
There were other people there too. 

18
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,314
Who? 

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,841
People who work on the programme.  

20
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:26,163
You mean other women who work on the programme. 

21
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,721
Yes and men, why not? Eh? 

22
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,700
I knew it! 

23
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,796
So, who is she? 

24
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:33,950
Who? 

25
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,631
The other woman. 

26
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:38,354
There is no other woman! 

27
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,784
Annie, listen. Oh, 

28
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,284
excuse me.

29
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:56,533
Hello. Ha, ha-ha, hi Debbie. And how are you? Ha-ha. Good. 

30
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,093
Erm, OK, that'll be OK, perfect, see you then. Bye. 

31
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,535
So was that her? 

32
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,493
Who? 

33
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:10,232
Debbie. The other woman. 

34
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:13,800
That was Debbie from the make-up department,

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,087
 confirming my call time for tomorrow. 

36
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,933
Oh! Some excuse! 

37
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,000
Hector. 

38
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,097
Yes. 

39
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:31,170
Please could you pass me your fork? 

40
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:39,207
Here, I'm going. You can have my dinner!! 

41
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,217
You should have seen Eunice's face! Ha-ha-ha! She was furious! 

42
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,611
When Eunice gets angry, she is a very scary lady! 

43
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,328
Hello. 

44
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,016
Yes.

45
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,598
 Excuse me. No, no...To her... Erm,

46
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,000
 bye, Bridget. 

47
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,984
Oh. All right Hector. Bye. 

48
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:37,467
Hola, Lola! Ah! 

49
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,927
Guess what? 
Prince William wants to marry you? 

50
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:52,856
I know that! No! I've got a promotion! 

51
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,734
That's nice. 

52
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:02,262
Nice? Nice? It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live! 

53
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:04,801
Eunice is no longer my boss! 

54
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,721
Is that Hugh Grant? 

55
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:16,817
It's Bridget Evans here. Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live. 

56
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,074
Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today? 

57
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:23,781
Oh, fab! Ciao!

58
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,994
Eunice is so jealous! 

59
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,800
Now that is good news. 

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,033
Annie, what are you doing? 

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm doing my own editing. 

62
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,891
Why are you cutting out photos of you and Hector? 

63
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:42,950
Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend. 

64
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,360
Really? Why? 

65
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:49,565
Because he is having an affair! 

66
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:54,349
Really?!! Who with?

67
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,743
Well, I thought it was Eunice, but now I think it's Debbie. 

68
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,600
Well I just heard him on the phone to Lola. 

69
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:12,800
Lola? Who's she? Hah! Eunice, Debbie, Lola, ha, he's women mad!! 

70
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,140
Hi Nick. 

71
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,134
What are you doing? 

72
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:45,872
I am not doing, I am being. 

73
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:49,494
Oh. What are you being? 

74
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,215
Can't you guess? 

75
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,526
A man on the toilet? 

76
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,850
A Sumo wrestler? 

77
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,954
Can't you see? I am an egg. 

78
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,044
Oh, of course, you are an egg. 

79
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:10,505
Now, what sort of egg am I? 

80
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:11,950
Hard-boiled. 

81
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,767
Scrambled. 
Scrambled?! 

82
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:16,200
Fried. 

83
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,600
Nearly! 

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,652
Poached! 

85
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:26,210
Oh yeah. Of course, you are a poached egg. 
Yeah!

86
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,714
Well you're making a mess on your bed! Ha-ha-ha! 

87
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,023
Anyway, why are you being a poached egg? 

88
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:40,601
It's my new acting class. Total Being.

89
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,749
Oh, what are you next week? A piece of wood? 

90
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,793
A piece of wood? 

91
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:48,882
Yeah, then it would be wooden acting! 

92
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:56,060
Anyway, can poached eggs talk? 

93
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,900
Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk. 

94
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,602
No, no, I mean, 

95
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:07,307
when you are 'being' a poached egg, can you talk? 

96
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,182
Oh yeah!

97
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,062
Anyway, I want to stop now, my arms are hurting. Ah! Agh! 

98
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:21,157
So, what do you want to talk about? 

99
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,828
It is Annie

100
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,156
She thinks I am having an affair. 

101
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,045
Who with? 
Eunice. 

102
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,315
And Debbie. 
What?

103
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,229
Two women, Hector! Ha! You cheeky thing! 

104
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,946
But I am not!

105
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:40,053
Oh, so tell Annie then.

106
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,279
I have, but she doesn't believe me. 

107
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,700
Why not? 

108
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:45,531
I don't know. 

109
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,067
Oh, Excuse me. 

110
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,775
Hola, Lola. Ha! 

111
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,998
I'll take this outside.? 

112
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,950
 How are you, Lola

113
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:06,298
So, it's not Eunice, it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola? 

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,535
Hey, hey, stop, please! 

115
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:33,161
I knew it! It had to be a selfish man driver! 

116
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:36,000
Please, I have a voucher.

117
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:39,290
I, I'm sorry, I've started, so I'll finish. 

118
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,486
Look I am Zeus, why are you so angry? 

119
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:48,946
I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus. 

120
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:22,822
People park on yellow lines and then are surprised when they get a parking ticket! Ha! 

121
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:28,011
There was this one guy today - 'please, I have a voucher.' Ha! 

122
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:30,392
No excuse! 

123
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:34,668
Mind you, he was quite cute.

124
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,325
Nick, Nick, are you OK? 

125
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,828
Bridget. 

126
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,370
Oh, it's you, Hector. 

127
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,800
Well, there's something wrong with Nick. 

128
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,395
Well I could have told you that! 

129
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:55,749
No, he won't speak, he won't move. 

130
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,875
Oh, I know. He is being a poached egg. 

131
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,033
A what? 

132
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:05,085
For his new acting class. 

133
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,920
Hi Nick.

134
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,999
Let me guess. You are being...

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,664
... a potato

136
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:19,484
Do I look like a potato? 

137
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:23,301
Yes. A couch potato! 

138
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,561
What about a fish? 

139
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,289
Yes, a frozen fish! 

140
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:37,638
I am not a fish. I am pain. 

141
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,261
You are a pain

142
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:42,723
Yes, Nick is a pain! 

143
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,289
No, I am pain. Hurt, agony. 

144
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,885
So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget? 

145
00:12:57,886 --> 00:13:01,563
What a day! I had a very important meeting. 

146
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:03,594
Big decisions to make. 

147
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:08,825
Oh, like which celebrities, new programme ideas? 

148
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:15,160
No, like which pen to use at my meeting. Blue, black … 

149
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,455
Oh, which one did you choose?
Blue.

150
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,800
Oh … 

151
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,157
Bad choice. 

152
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:25,449
You think so? Oh no! 

153
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job, she won't talk to anyone! 

154
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,344
Not even you? 
Not even me! It is great! 

155
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,915
You don't want her to talk to you? Really? 

156
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:45,953
Really! Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue. 

157
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:48,101
So do I. 

158
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,373
I miss you. 
I miss … 

159
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,269
Hola Lola. Ha-ha. … 

160
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,311
Right. Two can play that game. 

161
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,784
Hello again. 

162
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:50,439
Hello. We meet again. 

163
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,500
You're happier today. 

164
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:57,600
Yes, I am now! But, I'm sorry. 

165
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,483
I parked here, so you would come back. 

166
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:05,025
Oh. You wanted to see me again? 

167
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:08,086
You are so beautiful! 

168
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,277
Oh, well, I'm sorry, but I am going to have to give you... 

169
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,592
... this, my phone number. 

170
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,865
Call me. 

171
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,100
Who needs Hector? 

172
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,850
Hi Bridget. 

173
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,175
Oh! 

174
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,925
What 'oh'? 

175
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,500
I know, Superman. 
What? 

176
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,022
Erm, I mean Clark Kent. 

177
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,760
You are being Clark Kent for your acting class. 

178
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:08,402
No. I'm not. I'm long sighted. 

179
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Oh. You're being long sighted? 

180
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:20,279
No. I am long sighted. I need to wear glasses for reading. 

181
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,680
They suit you. 

182
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,210
Oh, ah, thank you. 

183
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,943
So why are you not at Channel 9 today. 

184
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:39,559
Oh, I'm working from home today. 

185
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
There's so much to do! 

186
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,800
Bridget, what's the matter? 

187
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,030
I can't do it! Eunice hates me! 

188
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:51,110
Oh, Eunice hates everybody! 

189
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,585
They all hate me! 
No they don't! 

190
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,158
They all look at me! 

191
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,619
Bridget, you are their boss. 

192
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,610
I have to use the executive loo! 

193
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,400
What's the matter with that? 

194
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,900
I want to chat to all the girls! 

195
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:17,756
Oh, Bridget, you are one of the cleverest, most beautiful women I know. 

196
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,176
Really? 

197
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,141
Well who are the others? 

198
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,818
What do you mean? 

199
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:30,030
You said I was only one of the cleverest most beautiful girls you know. 

200
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,645
Bridget! You can do this job. 

201
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:40,646
Channel 9 needs you. 

202
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,764
Thank you, Nick. 
Hey, it was nothing. 

203
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,431
You really look handsome in those glasses. 

204
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh, hi Annie. 

205
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:09,453
Oh, hi Hector. You look smart. 

206
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,999
Yes, I am going to meet someone. 

207
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:17,366
Oh, Annie, I have something to tell you. 

208
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,850
Oh, sorry. 

209
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:30,085
Oh, Lola! Vale. Si, si, ya voy. Hasta luego. 

210
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,376
'Annie, I have something to tell you.' 

211
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,424
Yes, that he is going on a date with Lola! That's what! 

212
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,622
Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

213
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,482
Oh hi Annie, I didn't hear you come in! 

214
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,498
Oh Nick! Stop it! 

215
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:00,860
Is everybody happy, apart from me?!  

216
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,337
Hello. 

217
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:14,408
Zeus! Hi! Well of course I remember you!

218
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,614
A drink? Tonight? Ah, I'd love to. 

219
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:49,168
Stop it! You're tickling me! 

220
00:20:55,455 --> 00:21:00,028
Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick. 

221
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,886
Hi - HI! 

222
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,377
Well hello Zeus!

223
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,569
Annie, where did you find him?! 

224
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,419
Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses though, does he? Eh? 

225
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,857
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus. 

226
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:30,867
Wonderful, H-Annie. Now I must say goodnight. 

227
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:34,156
Please, first may I use your bathroom? 

228
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,068
Certainly. 

229
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,600
Thanks.

230
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Zeus is such a gentle man. 
He certainly is a man. 

231
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:57,732
Hi. 

232
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,503
Annie, I must talk to you. 

233
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,631
What about? Your date with Lola? 

234
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:09,446
My date with Lola?!! 

235
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:16,634
Annie, Lola is a sixty year old chief executive for ATV. 

236
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,375
What's ATV? 

237
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:23,900
Argentinian Television. 

238
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:24,901
And...

239
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:32,678
she wants me to return to Argentina to present their number one show. 

240
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,699
But I don't want to go. 

241
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,956
I want to stay here - with you. 

242
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,458
That's better. 

243
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:54,200
Erm, Hector, this is … 

1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,497
Ohh, ohhh!

2
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:16,499
Hector, stop being such a baby.

3
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,111
But it hurts!

4
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,300
I haven't touched you yet.

5
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,340
Ohhh.

6
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:25,900
Now stay still. You will just feel a little needle prick.

7
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:30,900
Oh, go on then. Hurt me, do it!

8
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,032
Hector! 

9
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:32,650
Ohhhhh.

10
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:33,660
Hector! 

11
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,342
Ohhhhh.

12
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,500
I've done it.

13
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,500
Huh?

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,997
I've removed the splinter.

15
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,153
Huh? Oh, er, yes, I knew that. I was joking.

16
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:49,735
What is it, are you scared of needles?

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,957
Who, me? Don't be silly.

18
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,497
 But it was a very painful splinter.

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,194
OK, so if you're not scared of needles, would you have a tattoo?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,867
A tattoo?! 

21
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:13,289
Yes, yes, I would.

22
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,836
Go on then, tough guy.

23
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,399
OK, I'll have one if you have one.

24
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,630
OK. OK, it's a deal. 

25
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,300
Oh, by the way, Hector...

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,377
I had this done this morning. 

27
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:43,100
But then, a deal is a deal, isn't it?

28
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,500
I - want a word with you.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,881
Tough guy, eh?

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,172
Yeah. What do you want?

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:13,922
I - don't. I don't. I... keep forgetting this bit:

32
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,350
 I - don't - like - your - face.

33
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,450
OK, so is this for television or theatre?

34
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:31,394
Nope. This is real. This is me.

35
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:33,041
And you are...?

36
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,644
Can't you guess? 

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,035
Guys, you are looking at Muscles. 

38
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,187
Where?

39
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:53,020
No, no, no. It's my new name. I am the new man on the door at Ice.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,044
What, you're a bouncer?

41
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,806
What is a bouncer?

42
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:03,900
It's someone who throws people out of night-clubs.

43
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:08,545
Uh-uh-uh. I am an entry executive.

44
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,870
So you throw people out of the club.

45
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,437
Yeah.

46
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,251
Yeah. Nick, my granny could beat you up.

47
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:17,638
Ah! 

48
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,265
But if your granny came to Ice and caused trouble, 

49
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,902
I would have to ask her to leave. 

50
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,537
Besides, I'd have Knuckles, Cruncher and Muncher to back me up.

51
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,752
Who?

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,370
The other bouncers.

53
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,111
Yeah, right.

54
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Hi, sweetie. 

55
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,256
Has someone died?

56
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,273
No, not yet.

57
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,300
Why are you dressed in black then?

58
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:56,148
Because, baby, you are looking at the new man on the door at Ice.

59
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,219
You are on the door at Ice?

60
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,048
But that's.., but that's wonderful news! What shall I wear? 

61
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,414
I'll call the girls to find out what they're wearing.

62
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:18,771
The thing is, Bridget, if your name's not on the guest list, then you can't come in.

63
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:28,190
Nick, if my name's not on the guest list, then you can't come home.

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,511
Hello? Oh! Hi! 

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,190
Yup, that's right. I start on Friday.

66
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:48,724
 OK, baby! No probs. Leave it with me. Ciao!  

67
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:58,300
My mum. She wants me to do some gardening for her. 

68
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,609
Hector, I've just won... 

69
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,840
What are you doing?

70
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,295
Oh, just looking for a number.

71
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,252
Oh, I see. 

72
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:34,040
Well, I just wondered if you wanted to share my chocolate with me before Bridget sees it.

73
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,852
Oh yeah! Great! Thanks. 

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,550
Annie?
Huh?

75
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:46,410
Did I tell you about the time three people tried to fight me?

76
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,000
All at once?

77
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,050
Yup.

78
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,020
Really?

79
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:50,500
Uh-huh.

80
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,194
Oh, well, go on.

81
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,030
Well, three of them, they came at me...

82
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,567
Oh, you poor thing! And what did they want?

83
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:02,446
My sweets.

84
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:05,314
Oh. And how old were you?

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,076
Six.

86
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:08,807
And they were...?

87
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:11,430
Five, three and two.

88
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:16,339
Hector! Two years old! They were babies!

89
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,180
Yeah, but the Sanchez sisters were really tough!

90
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:22,808
Oh, Hector, you are sweet.

91
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,223
Annie.
Hmm?

92
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:31,500
Do you think I should be more macho?

93
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:37,016
Oh, Hector. You don't have to be a tough guy for me. 

94
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,100
I love you just the way you are.

95
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,998
Oh, Annie.

96
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,106
Come on, let's eat this chocolate before Bridget finds it.

97
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,800
Oh, please, let me.

98
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,492
Oh. Oh! Ooh, you're so strong! Oh!

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,100
Ow!

100
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,750
What is it?

101
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:04,113
You are standing on my foot.

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,309
Wimp.

103
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,677
Ah, hi, Nick.

104
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh, hi. Hey, listen to this. 

105
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,897
"Bouncer of the month is Alex Smith 

106
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:41,427
who last year stopped 955 people from going into his club."

107
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,500
What is the name of the club?

108
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,524
Er, it doesn't say. It shut down last week. Not enough people were going there.

109
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,561
Nick.

110
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:51,500
Huh?

111
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,810
What is a wimp?

112
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,614
Huh! Well, it's not... Ha-ah-ah …

113
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,300
Annie just called me a wimp.

114
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,500
Yeah.

115
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,948
I want to be a tough guy, like you.

116
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:07,973
Huh?

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,678
Can you teach me? Please?

118
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:17,640
Of course. I was born like this, 

119
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:22,470
but I can try to help you, Hector, I can try.

120
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:27,293
Great. Why don't you show me how to be a bouncer.

121
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,241
At - it - tude.

122
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,606
At - it - tude.

123
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:38,500
Yeah, like this.

124
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,594
Are you looking at me?

125
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,106
Are you looking at me?

126
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:49,294
Are you looking at me?

127
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:52,947
Are you looking at me?

128
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,595
Hey, great!

129
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,808
So who am I looking at when I say that?

130
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,850
Anyone who is looking for trouble.

131
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:02,923
Aha! 

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,862
And how do I know they are looking for trouble?

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,535
You just know. 

134
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,378
Look.

135
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,641
What is this?

136
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,989
Bridget's old toys!

137
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,708
What are they doing under your bed then?

138
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,400
I was looking after them for her. 

139
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:35,788
Anyway, look, here, this is the club. 

140
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,241
You - cannot - come in. 

141
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,618
Let me in! 

142
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,911
Are you looking at me or chewing a brick, eh? 

143
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:52,636
'Cause either way, you'll lose your teeth.

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,916
Huh?

145
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,895
You know - brick, teeth, chew - cha-cha-cha-cha!

146
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,455
Ah, very good!

147
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,731
You are a very scary guy. Hmm!

148
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,537
 Look! It's handsome Nick! Ohhh! Ohhh! 

149
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:20,400
Look at his muscles. Hmmm!

150
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:25,370
Hellooooo! You are looking lovely tonight.

151
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,700
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! .... 

152
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,693
Leave my boyfriend alone!

153
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,821
It's OK, Bridget. I'm just doing my job ... 

154
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:57,487
If your name's not on the guest list, then you cannot come in.  

155
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,124
If your name's not on the guest list, then you cannot come in. 

156
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,600
Huh! 

157
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,000
Hmm! 

158
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,582
Please could I have your name, sir?

159
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,530
What do you want that for?

160
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,995
Be...

161
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:33,244
...cause if your name's not on the … 

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,657
guest list, you cannot come in.

163
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,367
And what are you going to do about it, pip-squeak?

164
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,667
I … I … 

165
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,700
… Shall be a good boy! Aah-aah!

166
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,880
Didn't you hear what the man said?

167
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:09,797
 He said, "Go. Disappear. Vanish. Evaporate - now!"

168
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,911
OK, I'm going!

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,317
Sorry you had to see that, Bridget. 

170
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:23,406
Course I had the situation completely under control.

171
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,665
So, Bridget, why are you here? 

173
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,323
Hmm, what? Oh, I've brought you some sandwiches.

174
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,086
Oh, Bridget, how nice of you. Huh! 

175
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,421
Where are they?

176
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,856
Where are what?

177
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,394
The sandwiches.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,826
Oh, I must have left them behind. Never mind! So...

179
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,700
who's here tonight?

180
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:53,365
I'm afraid I can't tell you. It's confidential. Ha-ha-hum. 

181
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:05,028
OK, well, there's the usual crowd - Heidi, Kate, Naomi - oops! Sorry, Bridget! 

182
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,342
I have work to do. 

183
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,482
Good evening, ladies! Could I have your names, please? 

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,192
Thank you. Just one more thing. 

185
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,587
Bridget? 

186
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,464
Arms up, please, ladies.

187
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:31,215
 Hmm, you see, hmm, very nice. 

188
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,523
Thank you. 

189
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,457
Thank you very much, ladies. Have a great evening. 

190
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
All part of the job.

191
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,648
OK, Nick. So when is it my turn? I want to go in!

192
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:15,040
Oh, Bridget, Bridget, Bridget. I promise. As soon as I can arrange it, I will, hmm? 

193
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,555
Look, there's a big Latino night next week. 

194
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,321
J-Lo will be coming. Leave it to me.

195
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,119
Oh, thank you, Nick!

196
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,023
Oh-oh …  Stand back. I need to take control.

197
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,654
Good! Everything is under control.

198
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,950
Annie?

199
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,425
Hmm?

200
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,344
About the tattoo.

201
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:05,722
Hmm.

202
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:08,000
Er-hmm. Look.

203
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,461
Oh! You did it! 

204
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:20,782
Ohh, and Hector, what a wonderful tattoo! 

205
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,421
Oh, I don't know what to say! Oh!

206
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,420
Oh, it was nothing. 

207
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:31,620
And I mean it, Hector and Annie forever.

208
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:38,551
Oh, and look! Charley likes the tattoo as well. 

209
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,144
Oh, Charley! 

210
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,487
Oh, Hector!

211
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:45,502
Oh!

212
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,412
Oh, pl-ease. I've just eaten!

213
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,600
Bridget, look. Hector has had a tattoo done just for me! 

214
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,266
Oh, isn't it romantic?

215
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,811
Hec-ne-ver. Hec-ne-ver?

216
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,470
 It doesn't sound very romantic. What does it mean?

217
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:14,985
What happened? It's coming off! 

218
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,291
Oh. Charley has licked it off. 

219
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:25,629
It's a fake. Hector, you wimp!

220
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,198
Hi, Nick.

221
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,425
What's the joke?

222
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,276
I am.

223
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,300
Oh. 

224
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,121
Listen, J-Lo is coming to Ice tonight, 

225
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:54,062
so we need extra bouncers, so you will be working with me on the door!

226
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:55,700
But I...

227
00:19:55,701 --> 00:20:01,487
And tell Bridget and Annie they are on the guest list. 

228
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:03,192
OK, tough guy?

229
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,370
OK.

230
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,850
Good evening, ladies! You are looking lovely tonight.

231
00:20:53,851 --> 00:21:00,170
Oh, Hector, you look so handsome. I'm sorry I laughed at your tattoo.

232
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,952
Annie, Annie, Annie, I am on duty.

233
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,510
Is J-Lo here yet?

234
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,047
She's here.

235
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,993
Oh, goodie! I love mixing with the stars.

236
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,393
Hi.

237
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,877
She's cute. Hi, gorgeous.

238
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,215
What did he say?

239
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,381
Nothing.

240
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,111
Was he...? 

241
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,400
Erm.... 

242
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

243
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,200
What are you looking at? 

244
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:46,928
I am looking at you looking at her.

245
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,650
I can look at her.

246
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:53,991
Not when I am looking at her looking at you.

247
00:21:55,928 --> 00:22:00,441
I think you mean: Not when I'm looking at you looking at her.

248
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,339
That is what I said!

249
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,529
You know what? I tell you I'm gonna buy her a drink, OK?

250
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,925
What did he say?

251
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:18,670
I think he said he's gonna buy her a drink. 

252
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,183
Oh, Hector, no.

253
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,600
Right, that is it! I am going in!

254
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:28,400
No, Hector, don't. Please...

255
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:32,093
Oy, you! Leave my girl alone! 

256
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,877
Nick! Nick! His mate is chatting up Bridget.

257
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:40,793
Right, that's it! I'm going in! 

258
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,348
Oy, you! Leave my girl alone!

259
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,519
Muscles, you're fired! And so is your friend!

260
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,021
That was great!

261
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:23,052
I didn't even see J-Lo. 

262
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,839
See, Hector? I knew you weren't a wimp.

263
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,750
Next time in EXTRA, 

264
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,094
Annie is revising for her exams, 

265
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,926
Bridget has a make-over 

266
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:54,869
and guess who is coming to stay? 

267
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,763
EXTRA, don't miss it!


244
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:01,745
… Erm, Zeus, my new boyfriend. We've had a lovely evening, haven't we! 

245
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,996
Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs! 

246
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,076
So Hector, will you take the job? 

247
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,304
What do you think I should do, Annie? 

248
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,350
So we must say goodbye to our friends for now?

249
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:34,351
Will Hector stay or go back to Argentina?  

250
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:37,674
Will Annie go with him? 

251
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,614
And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

252
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:45,300
EXTRA - will the story continue?! 

253
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, there you go! 


1
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,318
Is he stupid?!

2
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,403
Yes, John!

3
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:12,653
Yes, I got the cards and the flowers
and the chocolates.

4
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:17,438
Yes, I got the cushion, as well.

5
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,763
But it's finished. Sorry!

6
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,257
[John on the phone]
But please, don't leave me!

7
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,020
Don't cry!

8
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,396
Oh, goodbye!

9
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,809
Oh, and happy birthday!

10
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:37,064
Ah! Men!

11
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,528
Come on Charley, come on.

12
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,802
Post, Bridget.

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,672
Charley and I have the post.
Haven't we, Charley?

14
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:54,797
Give me the post, Charley.
Give me the post, Charley.

15
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,193
Drop it, Charley.
Oh, good boy!

16
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:08,953
Oh, telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.
Oh.

17
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:12,220
Ah, what's this?

18
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:15,505
Mmm, a parcel for you, Bridget.

19
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,807
Oh, good.

20
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,288
What is it?

21
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,906
Oh, it's from mother.

22
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:34,201
Oh, ‘Bridget darling, this arrived for you
and I made you this. Love Mummy.’

23
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:39,221
Oh, ho-ho, oh very you, Bridget!

24
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,577
Mother!

25
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,125
Ooh, this is from Argentina.

26
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,321
Argentina. Who from? What does it say?

27
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,196
[Erm], it says
‘Hello, do you remember me?’

28
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:53,724
No.

29
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:58,159
‘Seven years ago we was pen pals.’

30
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,948
‘We was’ -  we were pen pals.

31
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:05,343
Oh yeah, now I remember, it’s Hector!

32
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:06,937
Who’s Hector?

33
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,634
He was my pen pal seven years ago.
Oh...

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,792
‘I speak English good now.’
I speak English good.

35
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:20,997
I speak English well now –
‘and I am coming to England.’

36
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,896
Oh, Latin Americans!

37
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:34,148
‘I would like to sleep with you.
Do you have a bed for me?’

38
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:40,125
Oh, he wants to stay here! [Oh]. Ah, ha, ha.

39
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,550
But [erm] what about the rules?

40
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:59,870
Ooh, a Latin American here,
ooh, like Ricky Martin!

41
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:03,984
Tall, handsome, rich!

42
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:13,730
So [erm] when is he coming?

43
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:17,293
Oh [erm] let me see.
It says ‘November 5th.’

44
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,390
Oh, November 5th.
But that’s …

45
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,794
Aaaah!!!

46
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,449
Oh, oh it’s you Nick!

47
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,900
Hi, babes!
Hello Nick. How are you?

48
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:54,552
Gr-eat.

49
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,028
Nice muscles.
Here’s your milk.

50
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:01,751
Our milk.

51
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,654
You mean our milk you borrowed
three weeks ago.

52
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,109
Oh, thanks Nick.

53
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,658
[Speaking in a mock Italian accent]
I forget nothing!

54
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:33,170
Would you like a drink, Nick?
Would you like a drink, Nick?

55
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:34,942
Uhh.

56
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,149
I said, would you like a drink, Nick?

57
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:47,564
Oh!

58
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,491
Sorry. No thanks.

59
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,299
Oh, erm, Bridget’s friend is coming.

60
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:57,920
Oh yeah.

61
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,780
Aha. From Argentina.

62
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,741
Wow! From Argentina!

63
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,157
What’s she like?

64
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,830
She is a he!

65
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,859
Huh?
Not a girl, a boy.

66
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,905
Oh.

67
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,176
Tough guy, ay!

68
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,155
Why don’t I show you
how to do it properly!

69
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:39,614
Nick, I've told you before.
Nobody uses my bike, nobody,

70
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:40,308
is that clear?

71
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,100
Why not?

72
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,162
Why not!!!

73
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,534
If you touch my bike again,
you are out! O-U-T, out!

74
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:47,778
Clear!
What?!

75
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:53,490
I said …

76
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:05,941
Hello.

77
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:07,411
Hello.

78
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:12,303
I am called Argentina.
I am from Hector.

79
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,524
You mean ‘I am called Hector.’

80
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,592
You are called Hector?

81
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,143
Oh, no, no, no, I am called Annie.

82
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,830
I am called Annie.

83
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,137
No! She means ‘I am called Hector,

84
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,334
I am from Argentina.’

85
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,312
You are from Argentina!

86
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:31,041
Oh,

87
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,256
come in!

88
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,041
My cars.

89
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:44,926
You play with cars?!

90
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,627
Yes, you play, no?

91
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:51,215
I play with cars.

92
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,189
He plays with cars!

93
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,217
I read.

94
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,245
I love the library.

95
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,746
Fascinating!

96
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:05,718
We go to the library, too.
Don't we, Bridget!

97
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,395
Yes, it's great!

98
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:10,749
Good.

99
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:15,505
I live here.

100
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,119
You live in a museum?
Full of old things?

101
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,909
Old things?

102
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:25,257
Yes, I have lots of old things.

103
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:30,747
I live in a museum.
OK. I live in a museum.

104
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:36,102
Well, thank you Hector and
now we’ll show you the flat.

105
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:40,255
This is the bedroom.

106
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:45,180
Thank you.

107
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,566
Who-hey!!

108
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,150
Where do you sleep?

109
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,849
[Erm] no you don’t understand,
we only have one bedroom.

110
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:59,739
One?
I have twenty.

111
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:01,454
Twenty?

112
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:07,107
Yes, he lives in a museum,
with twenty bedrooms.

113
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,664
Oh! Ha-ha-ha, very funny,
ha, twenty bedrooms!

114
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,595
Well, you can sleep here.

115
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:20,722
Oh, thank you.

116
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,805
Oh, no, no, no, Hector!

117
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,136
It’s a bed.

118
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,532
A bed?   Ah, oh …

119
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:34,531
Here's a cushion.

120
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,490
Oh, thank you.

121
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,450
Oh, this of course is the TV.

122
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:44,123
But just relax, I must go to the bathroom.

123
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,589
Psst! Annie! Bathroom!!

124
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:51,170
Now!

125
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,392
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

126
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,430
He plays with toy cars!

127
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:06,965
He is not a sexy Argentinian.

128
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:09,904
But he is sweet.

129
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,397
And he is polite.

130
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,266
But those clothes!

131
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:19,354
Oh, he is so old-fashioned.

132
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,740
Mm, he must go.

133
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:44,103
Room service.

134
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,253
Hello. Who are you?

135
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:55,017
Oh, you who are quick, good

136
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:55,650
Ay?

137
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:59,477
My luggage is downstairs.

138
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,382
What?

139
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,540
Bring it up, please.

140
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,796
What are you doing?

141
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:13,003
I pulled, you come,
you are the butler.

142
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,049
The butler?!

143
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,721
I am Nick, I live next door.

144
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,839
Oh, I, … I am Hector.

145
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:29,765
Oh, Hector, from Argentina.
Yes, from Argentina!

146
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,112
Where are the girls?

147
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,518
The girls?
Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

148
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh they live here.

149
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,560
Yeah, I know.

150
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,842
Where’s Bridget?
Does she know you are here?

151
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,971
Bridget, she gave me this.

152
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:50,303
Oh.

153
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,169
Hello Nick!

154
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,611
Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.
Yeah, I know.

155
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:01,350
Isn’t he wonderful!
Wonderful.

156
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:02,932
Are you hungry?

157
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:03,625
Uh?

158
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,327
We’ll buy your lunch.

159
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:06,990
What would you like to eat?

160
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:08,512
Fish and chips?

161
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:11,597
Oh, fish and ships!!

162
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,400
[Erm] Nick, Hector, make friends.

163
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,720
Nick, teach Hector some English.

164
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:28,533
Yeah, OK,
I’ll teach Hector some English.

165
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:46,703
OK, this is the oven.

166
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,116
This is the ov-en.

167
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:53,749
Annie’s dog sleeps in the oven.

168
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:58,093
Annie’s dog sleeps in the oven.

169
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,448
So you say
“Annie! The dog is in the oven!”

170
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,486
Annie, the dog is in the oven!

171
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,379
Gr-eat!

172
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:10,726
Now, Bridget.

173
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,537
Oh, oh dear.

174
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,650
Well Bridget likes strong men,
especially strong legs.

175
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,345
Well I am strong.

176
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:20,995
Yeah?

177
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:25,469
Can you cycle fifty kilometres?

178
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,046
Yes.

179
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:28,266
No way!

180
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:29,151
Yes.

181
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:30,505
Well go on then, show me.

182
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:32,880
Yes, look!

183
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,619
Adios, Amigo!

184
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,040
Ah, Bridget, Annie, lunch!

185
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,230
Fish and chips!

186
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,197
Yes, lunch, Hector.

187
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:19,102
Look Bridget, fifty kilometres.

188
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,283
Oh, Annie,
the dog is in the ov-en.

189
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,005
What?
Oh!

190
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:37,244
Hi, everything OK?

191
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,774
Gr-eat!

192
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:43,118
Pouf!

193
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,405
I am, how do you say?

194
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:48,269
Dead!

195
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,883
Hot.
Hot.Yeah,

196
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,243
I am hot, I need a ..

197
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,631
… Shower.

198
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:55,846
Yeah, I need a shower.

199
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,743
Be my guest!

200
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,903
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,494
Right, that’s it!
He must go!

202
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,151
Why?
He is so nice.

203
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,085
He used my bike!
Oh!

204
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,162
Yeah, and he said that
the dog was in the oven!

205
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,405
What a horrible joke!

206
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,398
Where is Charley?

207
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,399
Charley!

208
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:25,800
What a bad, bad boy.

209
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:26,845
He must go!

210
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:28,666
Can he stay with you, Nick?

211
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:30,536
Ah-ah, sorry ladies.

212
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,350
Oh please Nick,
you have a spare room.

213
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:35,310
No way, not my problem.

214
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,723
He must go now!

215
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,125
But he’s in the shower.

216
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,632
I don’t care!

217
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:48,873
Hector, please come out,
we want to talk to you.

218
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,640
I like fish and ships, I …

219
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,963
Hector, please come out,
we want to talk to you.

220
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,492
OK, one moment please!

221
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,869
I like fish and chips!

222
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,863
Yes, you want me.

223
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,187
We think we...

224
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,186
… We, we,
we have a problem.

225
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,408
It’s like this.

226
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:23,594
Go on then, tell him.

227
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,206
Yes, Bridget

228
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,207
Hector, the thing is …

229
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,576
Stay there, I’ll talk to him.

230
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,528
Hector, can I have a word please?

231
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,012
Oh …

232
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:56,730
Ricky Martin!

233
00:19:57,381 --> 00:20:00,085
Hector, is this you?

234
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,102
Yes, and my parents.

235
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,591
The Romero family.

236
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,988
One of the richest families
in Argentina.

237
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,542
Who are these?

238
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:14,834
My …

239
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:17,759
… Servants.

240
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,172
Yeah, my servants.

241
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,398
Your cars?

242
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,304
Yeah, my cars.

243
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,356
Hector, you are rich!

244
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:31,998
Why stay here?

245
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,576
I want friends, good friends

246
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,548
People like you for your money?

247
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:46,501
That’s awful!

248
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:51,848
[Erm] listen, keep it a secret. Sshh.

249
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:54,889
OK!

250
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,322
Perhaps he could stay here.

251
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,404
Yes – poor boy

252
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:08,780
Shut up, Nick.

253
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,937
Hector will stay with us,
won’t you, Hector.

254
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,885
Hector, come and – sit down.

255
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:24,710
Hector please, call me Gigi!

256
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,238
Oh, Charley, there you are.

257
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,662
Oh Annie, the dog is in the ov-en.

258
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:36,439
The oven?

259
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:40,950
Yes, Nick is a good English teacher.

260
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,324
Yes, a very good English teacher!

261
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:51,249
I’d love to see your photos again.

262
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,761
Oh, me too!

263
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,773
Oh, your sweet toy cars!

264
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:02,590
They are not toys!

265
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,364
Today Hector arrives and
it’s Bonfire Night.

266
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:08,925
Let’s party!

267
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:11,192
What sort of music do you like?

268
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,540
Music?

269
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:17,175
Yeah, music, you know,
soul, funk, dance.

270
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:18,652
Watch me, like this.

271
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:27,318
Interesting.

272
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:33,639
I dance – like this. [Oh!].

273
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,400
I’ll get it, I’ll get it.

274
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,223
Hello.

275
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:54,596
Oh, yeah, that’s great,
sure, come up.

276
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,428
It’s the landlady!

277
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,350
The tarantula!

278
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,880
Quick, hide, Hector.

279
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,566
I’m off,
I owe two week’s rent!

280
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,350
Aaah!!

281
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,800
Next time in EXTRA –
the flat mates go shopping for Hector.

282
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:26,850
Hector goes shopping for the girls.

283
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,203
But what happens when Hector
goes shopping for himself?

284
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,300
EXTRA – don’t miss it!
