1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,991
(buzzing)

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,752
That's it.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,992
Can I just, you know,
Iook at it for a minute?

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,275
You're an artist, Sid.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,759
You're teIIing me you're gonna waIk
outta here and I'm never gonna see it again?

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,593
There's a good chance of that, yes.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,036
Most guys, for the first one,
they start with something smaII.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,918
''Mom'', girIfriend's initiaIs,
something Iike that.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,275
Not you.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,511
You get a fuII set of sIeeves
aII in a coupIe of months.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,831
It takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,195
I don't have a few years.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,395
Wish to heII I did.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,509
(woman screams)

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,391
- The vauIt. Open it.
- We can't. The branch manager's not here.

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,392
- Where is he?
- It's Iunchtime. He's at White CastIe.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,516
- White CastIe?
- A fast-food restaurant.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
They serve those IittIe square burgers.

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,311
I know what it is.

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm not pIaying games. Open it.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,312
Sir, you have haIf a miIIion doIIars cash
in your bag. Don't you think it'd be better if...?

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,391
(sirens)

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,275
This is the poIice.
You are compIeteIy surrounded.

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,755
Put down your weapon.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,549
Put down your weapons now!

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,079
RareIy in the case of armed robbery
do we hear a pIea of no contest.

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,232
- Are you sure about this, Mr ScofieId?
- I'm sure, Your Honour.

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,518
Your Honour, we'd Iike to recess if we couId.
My cIient's a bit confused.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,636
- I'm not.
- He is, Your Honour.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,794
Perhaps you shouId heed her advice. Take
additionaI time to consider your response.

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,952
I've aIready done that, Your Honour.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,116
I'II retire to my chambers to determine
sentencing. Court's recessed untiI 1:30.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,595
- Hey, come on. Let's go.
- UncIe Mike?

34
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,835
I didn't want you to come.
Go home, LJ.

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,388
I didn't want you to see this.

36
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,072
- He won't take this weII.
- Can you bIame him? He's your nephew.

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,438
He's beginning to think anybody he attaches
himseIf to is gonna end up in prison.

38
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,559
And he's not the onIy one
who's starting to feeI that way, MichaeI.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,598
- WiII you give us a minute?
- One minute.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,398
Don't you understand?

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,995
You put the book in that woman's hand.
She'II Iob it at you Iike a grenade.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,435
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,669
I know.

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,230
- So teII me what's going through your head.
- We've been over this.

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,835
I've known you aII my Iife.
You don't have a vioIent bone in your body.

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,559
- And I know you didn't need the money.
- Veronica...

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,351
- Why won't you Iet me heIp you?
- You've been good to me my whoIe Iife.

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,910
But you gotta Iet me deaI with this. OK?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,596
Given your Iack of prior criminaI conduct,
I am incIined toward probation.

50
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,038
But the fact you discharged a weapon whiIe
committing the crime suggests maIice to me.

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,070
For that reason, I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison ceII, Mr ScofieId.

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,517
You've requested to be incarcerated
near your home here in Chicago.

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,192
I'm wiIIing to honour that.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,432
- The cIosest IeveI one faciIity...
- LeveI one? That's maximum security.

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,717
I wouId ask counseI
to refrain from interrupting me.

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,316
As I was saying, the cIosest IeveI one faciIity
wouId be Fox River State Penitentiary.

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,312
As for your sentence,
I'm setting it at five years.

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,235
You'II be eIigibIe for paroIe in haIf that time.
Sentence to be carried out immediateIy.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,313
(man) OK, peopIe, step inside the door. Check
yourseIf for bugs. Keep the Iine moving.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,153
We ain't got aII day to get this done.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,390
No taIking in Iine.

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,155
Keep that Iine moving.
Keep it moving. Next.

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,669
- Name and bank number.
- ScofieId, MichaeI. 94941.

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,228
- You a reIigious man?
- Never thought about it.

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,915
Good, cos the Ten Commandments
don't mean piss in here. We got two onIy.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,434
The first commandment is,
you got nothin' comin'.

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,876
- What's the second commandment?
- See commandment number one.

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,316
- Gotcha.
- You taIking out the side of your neck?

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,075
- Come again?
- I said, are you bein' a smartass?

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,032
Just trying to fIy Iow, avoid the radar, boss.
Do my time and get out.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,788
- There isn't any fIyin' under my radar.
- Good to know.

72
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,071
(cacophony of voices)

73
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,112
Can't a brother get some air conditioning
up here? It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth.

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,478
To heII with the AC, man.
Gimme the crack ho.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,195
Come on!

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,553
Yo, fish. What you Iookin' at?
You Iook kinda pretty to be up in here, man.

77
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,198
Fish!

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,593
I suggest you take a seat, fish.
Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.

79
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,432
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.

80
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,432
Argh!

81
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,918
(prisoners yelling)

82
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,794
WeIcome to PrisneyIand, fish.

83
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,070
- (yelling continues)
- (pA) Attention, all prisoners...

84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,030
- You wanna taIk about it?
- It's not worth taIking about.

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,193
- If it's keeping you up it is.
- No, it's just...

86
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,919
It's nothing, you know.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,675
- MichaeI's case.
- You did the best you couId.

88
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,432
But he didn't.

89
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,355
He just roIIed over, he didn't put up a fight.
It's not Iike him. I...

90
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,799
- I'm sorry. I shouIdn't be taIking about him.
- Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind.

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,871
Good night.

92
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,399
(pA) All lanes, start coming out.
All lanes, start coming out.

93
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,439
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops,
Norte��os got the bIeachers,

94
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,193
Woods got the weight piIe.

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,593
The COs got the rest. I teII you, the guards
have the dirtiest gang in this whoIe pIace.

96
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,036
The onIy difference between us and them
is the badge.

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,998
- Who's the pet Iover?
- He'II deny it, but he's DB Cooper.

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,868
Parachuted out of a pIane 30 years ago
with a miIIion and a haIf in cash.

99
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,428
- Doesn't Iook Iike the type.
- Who does?

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,114
Hey! Whaddup, WhoIesaIe? You OK?

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,715
Gonna be greater Iater.
What you doin' with this fish, man?

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,191
He's my new ceIIie. WhoIesaIe's
got it wired up at the commissary.

103
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,111
Anything you want, he can get it.

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,794
You keep handin' out my jacket,
I'II bust your grape.

105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,479
You couIdn't bust a grape in Napa with a set
of cIeats on. What are you taIkin' about?

106
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,996
(running water)

107
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,195
I'm Iooking for someone.

108
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,317
- Guy named LincoIn Burrows.
- Linc the Sink?

109
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,550
- That what they're caIIing him now?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,349
As in, he'II come at you
with everything but the kitchen, snowfIake.

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,078
Where can I find him?

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,631
Man kiIIed the VP's brother.
In a month he's getting the chair.

113
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,793
Which means no one here's more dangerous
than him, cos he's got nothing to Iose now.

114
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,316
- What are they gonna do, kiII him twice?
- Any way I can get to him?

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,278
The onIy time those boys get out
is for chapeI and PI.

116
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,352
- PI? What's that?
- Prison industry.

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,390
The guys that get aIong get to work - painting,
scrubbing, making mattresses, you name it.

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,029
I wouIdn't get excited if I were you, fish.
You ain't sniffin' none of PI.

119
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,669
- Why's that?
- Cos John Abruzzi runs it.

120
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,435
- ''John Abruzzi'' John Abruzzi?
- ''John Abruzzi'' John Abruzzi.

121
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,195
Why do you want to see Burrows
so bad, anyhow?

122
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,435
Because he's my brother.

123
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,471
- They denied the motion.
- Do it again.

124
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,714
I can't. May 11th. That's the date, man.
That's the date they, uh, you know...

125
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,394
- execute me.
- I know.

126
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,510
- I didn't kiII that man, MichaeI.
- The evidence says you did.

127
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,797
I don't care what the evidence says.
I didn't kiII him.

128
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,075
Swear to me.

129
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,469
I swear to you, MichaeI.

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,917
But how did they get it wrong, then?
The courts, the appeaIs...

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,468
Don't know. Don't know.

132
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,678
AII I keep thinking, Iooking back on it,
is I was set up.

133
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,197
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickIy as possibIe.

134
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,037
- What's another word for ''Iove''?
- What's the context?

135
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,433
The ''I Iove you so much I ain't never
knockin' over a Iiquor store again'' context.

136
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,795
- Except, you know, cIassy.
- Mm.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,633
- I'm proposing to my girI, if you gotta know.
- In a Ietter?

138
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,234
- You got a better way?
- Face to face is good.

139
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,031
This ain't exactIy the romantic spot. I'm
gonna have her get on the Staten IsIand Ferry,

140
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,874
then once she can see the Empire
State BuiIding, she opens the Ietter...

141
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,112
It's Iike aImost being there.
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,952
Try ''passion''.

143
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,112
''Passion''. ''Passion''. That's dope.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,595
How do you speII that? Is it P-A-S-H...?

145
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,636
No H?

146
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,598
- LJ, hoId up.
- HoId up?

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,959
- I don't think I can go through with this.
- Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me.

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,272
We understand each other, then?
Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.

149
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,750
- TotaIIy understood.
- I don't want 100s, fives or ones.

150
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,673
I know, I know. Tens and 20s onIy.

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,075
It's on.

152
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,751
(siren)

153
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,151
PoIice!

154
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,198
Abruzzi. I need you to hire me at PI.

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,309
- Beat it.
- Maybe you oughta hear what I gotta say.

156
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,595
You got nothing I need.

157
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,035
- WouIdn't be too sure of that.
- My mistake.

158
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,918
Just what I need. A duck.

159
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,199
PI, Abruzzi. You might find
I can be of more assistance than you think.

160
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,634
MuII it over.
Come find me when you're ready to taIk.

161
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,230
AII right, guys. Pick it up.
I wanna get home tonight.

162
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,311
Maggio?

163
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,194
- Yeah. So?
- That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

164
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,191
That's Fibonacci?

165
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,674
- I thought that punk was gone forever.
- EvidentIy somebody found him.

166
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,788
- Is somebody messin' with us?
- This you're not gonna beIieve.

167
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,394
What is it?

168
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,235
Tattoo Iooks fresh.
HoId that.

169
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,479
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needIes.

170
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,519
- I'm MichaeI, by the way.
- ScofieId. I read your report.

171
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,637
- And you are?
- Dr Tancredi wiII do.

172
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,314
''Tancredi'' Iike the governor?

173
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,270
You're not reIated, are you?

174
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,792
Hm. WouIdn't think you'd find the daughter
of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,589
- As a doctor, no Iess.
- I beIieve in being part of the soIution,

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,353
- not the probIem.
- Hm.

177
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,910
''Be the change you want to see in the worId.''

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,908
What?

179
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,470
- Nothing. That was just my senior quote.
- That was you?

180
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,154
This whoIe time I was thinking it was Gandhi.

181
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,839
You're very funny. Sit tight. Put direct
pressure on that. I'II be back in a sec.

182
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,676
So, how do we pIay this?
You hook me up with a few weeks' suppIy?

183
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,274
Nice try. No hypos on the fIoor.

184
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,113
I'm the farthest thing from ajunkie.
Trust me.

185
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,954
I got news for you. ''Trust me''
means absoIuteIy zero inside these waIIs.

186
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,635
The onIy way you're getting that insuIin
is if I'm administering it.

187
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,280
Guess we'II be seeing
a Iot of each other, then.

188
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,555
I guess so.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,629
We're aII cIear on the Burrows execution,
except for one thing.

190
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,870
Bishop McMorrow is not in the foId.

191
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,713
He's got a Iot of infIuence with the governor.
They went to prep schooI together apparentIy.

192
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,950
Look, the cIoser it gets,

193
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,115
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna faII out of this whoIe thing.

194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,752
WeII, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

195
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,879
Look, in one month, it'II aII be over.

196
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,112
''The Son of Man must be deIivered
into the hands of sinfuI men

197
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,909
and be crucified,
and the third day rise again.''

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,390
''And they remembered his words.''
And so shouId you.

199
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,870
Good day, gentIemen.
May God be with you.

200
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,075
MichaeI?

201
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,754
Let's go. Come on, keep moving.

202
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,795
- Why?
- I'm getting you out of here.

203
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,792
Burrows! RoII it up. Happy hour's over.

204
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,590
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace it isn't.

205
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,590
(Veronica) Too formaI.

206
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,918
Too greeting-card.

207
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,798
We gotta make a decision
sooner or Iater, you know.

208
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,668
- We have time.
- (laughs) We don't, actuaIIy.

209
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,116
At some point
we gotta puII the trigger on this thing.

210
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,389
I don't wanna rush this. We're onIy
gonna do it once. We have to get it right.

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,473
- Honey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

212
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,711
- Are you putting this off?
- What do you mean?

213
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,475
- I mean, are you having second thoughts?
- No.

214
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,074
Honey, no. I'm not.

215
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,439
I just can't heIp thinking this is about...

216
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,875
It's not.

217
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,839
I Iove you. And I wanna be your wife.

218
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,116
- ''Passion''? What were you thinking?
- Hey, you went for it.

219
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,351
She probabIy thinks
I went sissy up in here. ''Passion''.

220
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,034
Got more than one syIIabIe,
too much taIking.

221
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,509
That's me from now on. One-SyIIabIe Sucre.

222
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,275
''Yes'', ''no'', ''Iove'', ''hate''... ''Iove''.

223
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,590
- Give it time.
- Are you kidding?

224
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,392
I proposed to her. That doesn't take time.
''S?' or ''no''. One syIIabIe, man.

225
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,153
She's supposed to come
for a conjugaI on Tuesday.

226
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,073
She aIways caIIs me beforehand
to Iet me know she's coming.

227
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,152
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

228
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,196
You spooked her.

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,353
ScofieId. Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

230
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,115
No good, fish.
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

231
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,510
Not unIess he's reaI interested
in what you got going on.

232
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,229
Top of your cIass at LoyoIa.
Magna cum Iaude, in fact.

233
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,872
I can't heIp wondering what someone with
your credentiaIs is doing in a pIace Iike this.

234
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,633
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

235
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,316
You make it sound Iike a traffic infraction,
Iike going the wrong way up a one-way street.

236
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,710
Everyone turns up one sooner or Iater.

237
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,434
The reason I caIIed you here,

238
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,038
I noticed in your I-fiIe, under ''Occupation'',
you put down ''unempIoyed''.

239
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,793
That's not true, now, is it?

240
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,553
I know you're a structuraI engineer, ScofieId.

241
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
Shah Jahan buiIt the Taj MahaI

242
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,670
as a monument
to his undying Iove for his wife.

243
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,513
My wife is quite fond of the story.

244
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,398
It appeaIs to the romantic in her.

245
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,072
Being married to someone in corrections,
terribIe job. WouIdn't wish it on anyone.

246
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,472
And yet, in 39 years,
my wife has never compIained.

247
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,597
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

248
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,430
So, because I couIdn't say it,
I thought, you know, I couId buiId it.

249
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,717
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

250
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,952
But here, Iook...

251
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,031
You see, the probIem is,

252
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,636
I buiId any more, it's aII gonna
come down Iike a house of cards.

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,473
That's where I was hoping
you couId be of assistance.

254
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,314
And for the favour, I can offer you
three days of work a week in here,

255
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,994
and it'II keep you off the yard.

256
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,435
I can't do it.

257
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,831
Son, it's better for me to owe you one in here
than it is for you to owe me one,

258
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,990
I can promise you that.

259
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,275
I'II take my chances.

260
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,915
Then we're through here.

261
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,069
Guard!

262
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,151
Two pounds of pot?
What were you trying to do, set a record?

263
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,028
It's not funny, LJ.
You couId be going to jaiI.

264
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,192
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

265
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,077
Hey.

266
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,151
Thanks.

267
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,272
- From who? OId Daddy Warbucks?
- He's a good man.

268
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,430
We got nothing in common.

269
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,154
Where's this coming from, LJ? Last semester
you were getting aImost aII As, and now...

270
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,912
- It's your father, isn't it?
- I don't have a father.

271
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,039
It wasn't an immacuIate conception, honey.
Trust me.

272
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,113
(sighs) Maybe it's time
you went and saw him.

273
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,074
Mom.

274
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,515
Mom! Don't.

275
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,910
I'm about as excited by that as you are,
but something's gotta give.

276
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,075
You have got too much potentiaI
to be screwing up your Iife Iike this.

277
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,949
What if they'd sent you
to TayIorviIIe or Marion and not here?

278
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,636
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing
in here - eating JeII-O, drinking KooI-Aid.

279
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,840
I know what you're doing. It's not the Iuck
of the draw that you're in here with LincoIn.

280
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,150
You forget I know you. Both of you.

281
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,710
You two have the most dysfunctionaI
idea of Iove I've ever seen.

282
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,950
He beats you up to keep you off the street,

283
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,713
so you get yourseIf
tossed into Fox River with him?

284
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,189
To what? Save him?

285
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,232
I deserve to know.
I Ioved him as much as you did.

286
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,675
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

287
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,632
I gave him a shot
when I got back from coIIege. I did.

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,157
Even with aII the stuff going on, I did aII
I couId to make it work, and he threw it away.

289
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,994
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you Ieft in the first pIace?

290
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,834
Don't do this. Whatever it is you're doing,
there's a better way.

291
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,354
- I'm appeaIing your case.
- I toId you not to.

292
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,159
I got in touch with the diocese about Linc.
The bishop...

293
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,516
That won't stop it. It'II onIy deIay it.

294
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,034
You wanna do something?
You find out who's trying to bury him.

295
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,476
Nobody's trying to bury him.
The evidence was there.

296
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,278
The evidence was cooked.

297
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,360
(officer) Visiting hours are now over.

298
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,919
(bell rings)

299
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,911
(Veronica) Take care of yourseIf.

300
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,070
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.
Something more is going on here.

301
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,072
This is desperation, MichaeI.
You're in deniaI.

302
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,958
Maybe. But I can't watch him die.

303
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,395
I won't do that.

304
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,989
GentIemen.

305
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,550
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can heIp you with?

306
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,349
It's our understanding that you have
great infIuence with the governor.

307
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,319
I wouIdn't say it's great, or infIuence.
We're friends.

308
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,631
It's aIso our understanding
that you oppose the death penaIty.

309
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,359
- I'm a man of God. How couId I not?
- In this case,

310
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,433
we're hoping you'II suspend that position,
at Ieast temporariIy.

311
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,594
If the inmate appeaIs to me for intervention,
how can I turn my back on him?

312
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,478
You have a habit of answering a question
with a question.

313
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,839
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

314
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,432
- Are you saying you won't do it?
- I'm not a man to equivocate.

315
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,869
- You're, what, 62 now, Your ExceIIency?
- That's right.

316
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,157
So you shouId be weII versed
in how the tax system works.

317
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,279
Taking personaI capitaI gains
under the church's tax sheIter,

318
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,352
that wouId be fraud,
wouIdn't it, Your ExceIIency?

319
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,672
I wiII not be cowed
into forsaking my beIiefs.

320
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,671
Not by you, or anyone eIse.

321
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,517
AdmirabIe.

322
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,034
Good day, ExceIIency.

323
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,150
Mr KeIIerman, what is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

324
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,395
The man kiIIed the Vice-President's brother.

325
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,430
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

326
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,956
Someone found Fibonacci.
I'm Iooking at the photos right now.

327
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,636
Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses.
Witness protection if l ever saw it.

328
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,119
Who was this someone?

329
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,990
Don't know. There's no return address
on the enveIope. Just...

330
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
this foIded-up bird, made of paper.

331
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,479
- Like origami?
- Yeah, Iike that.

332
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,755
Like origami.

333
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,277
- You're CharIes WestmoreIand, right?
- Do I know you?

334
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,750
- I knew your wife, before she passed.
- You knew MarIa?

335
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,037
- You mean Ann?
- How'd you know her?

336
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,873
- We taught together in Boston.
- East Farmington.

337
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,349
You mean West WiImington?

338
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,908
No more tests, I promise.

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,552
Seems you know everything about me.
Who are you?

340
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,996
MichaeI ScofieId.
How'd you get it in here?

341
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,150
First off, she's not an it.

342
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,676
She's MariIyn,
and she's grandfathered back from the days

343
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,355
when prisoners were aIIowed
a creature comfort or two.

344
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,635
Heard you were DB Cooper.

345
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,158
Every new fish that comes in, first thing they
hear is CharIes WestmoreIand's DB Cooper.

346
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,708
I'II teII you Iike I teII them.

347
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,396
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you, cos I'm not him.

348
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,393
That's too bad. I sort of wish it was true.
The man's a Iegend.

349
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,597
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

350
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,958
I'd have a miIIion five
waiting for me on the outside.

351
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,955
I'd put some grass under 'em if I were you.

352
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,157
This thing'd go a whoIe Iot easier
if you'd just hire me.

353
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,549
What is this aII about?

354
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,552
Say you were abIe to get outside those waIIs.

355
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,438
Are there peopIe in pIace
to make you disappear forever?

356
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,273
- What do you care?
- I'm just curious.

357
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,558
- Where's Fibonacci?
- That's not the way it works.

358
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,796
They come at me, John, I'm coming after you.

359
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,235
I doubt it.

360
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,549
(klaxon)

361
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,517
AII right.

362
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,636
Get on the ground.

363
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,157
I totaIIy misjudged you, ScofieId.
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

364
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,993
Behaviour Iike that
wiII not be toIerated in my prison.

365
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,231
90 days in the SHU oughta be
enough time to convince you of that.

366
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,709
- 90 days?
- That's right.

367
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,230
- Something you wanna say?
- It's just...

368
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,630
- I'm not of much vaIue to you in the SHU.
- VaIue?

369
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,554
The Taj. It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder
of the modern worId to coIIapse

370
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,870
because the stress isn't properIy propagated.

371
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,872
- ProperIy propagated?
- ProperIy propagated.

372
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,791
The joints are overIoaded.

373
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,829
They won't provide anywhere near the sheer
strength the compIeted structure wiII need.

374
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,151
- How much work are we taIking?
- You want it by when, June?

375
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,913
- Yes.
- Then we'd better get started,

376
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,752
wouIdn't you say?

377
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,831
(heavy breathing)

378
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,558
(creaking)

379
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,031
Who's there?

380
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,396
Bishop McMorrow was kiIIed Iast night.
Someone shot him whiIe he was sIeeping.

381
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,438
- I thought you'd wanna know.
- Thanks.

382
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,234
MichaeI was right.

383
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,476
Sink! You got a visitor.

384
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,992
He was arrested.

385
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,631
- For what?
- Possession of marijuana.

386
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,477
I figured he couId use
some fatherIy advice before it's...

387
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,391
- Gone forever?
- I didn't mean that.

388
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,153
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

389
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,511
So...

390
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,358
Dope, huh? Using or deaIing?

391
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,394
- What's the difference?
- Then what?

392
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,359
You think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

393
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,796
You've got a piece of the good Iife.
Take advantage.

394
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,792
Look, I get it. The whoIe thing.

395
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,034
She drags me in here, you give me
a big speech, I waIk away a changed man.

396
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,159
Straight As, Harvard,
grow up and be a dentist.

397
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,834
It's better than being here.

398
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,952
You gotta reaIise who gets punished
when you do what you do.

399
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,316
You think it's me. It's you.
I did the same thing.

400
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,520
Punished the oId man cos he was gone.
Look where it got me.

401
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,959
I'm not asking you to Iove me.
I aIready screwed up that chance Iong ago.

402
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,229
I'm asking you to Iove yourseIf.
You can stiII put the brakes on this thing.

403
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,393
- So that's what fatherIy advice is Iike.
- Where are you going?

404
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,435
- I got homework.
- They're putting me to death, LJ.

405
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,589
In a month's time, I'II be dead.
You get that?

406
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,829
You're aIready dead to me.

407
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,751
Co��o.

408
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,514
Yes.

409
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,594
What, you mean ''yes, yes''?

410
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,230
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

411
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,397
- Just one thing.
- Of course.

412
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,119
- My mom wants us to wait tiII you get out.
- Of course.

413
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,590
And we have to get married in a church.
A CathoIic church.

414
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,673
WouIdn't want to mess
with the CathoIic roots, wouId we?

415
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,834
- You went to LoyoIa.
- You've been checking up on me.

416
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,708
I Iike to get to know my patients.
I went to Northwestern.

417
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,392
Maybe we met before.

418
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,313
- Drunk, out at a bar somewhere.
- I wouId have remembered.

419
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,550
- That a compIiment?
- No.

420
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,596
Hm.

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,070
- What?
- Your bIood gIucose is 50mg per deciIitre.

422
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,230
- So?
- It's hypogIycaemic.

423
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,073
Your body is reacting
Iike you're not a diabetic.

424
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,109
- You sure it's type 1 diabetes you've got?
- Ever since I was a kid.

425
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,875
- Any tingIing, coId sweats?
- (phone rings)

426
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,993
Infirmary.

427
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,310
Yes.

428
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,391
Yeah, he did.

429
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,668
No, I did one a week ago.

430
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,471
OK.

431
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,758
Great. WeII, I'II caII him after Iunch, then.
Thanks. I'm with a patient. OK.

432
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,274
I'd Iike to run some tests
next time you're in.

433
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,272
I don't want to administer insuIin
to a man who doesn't need it.

434
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,316
Yeah. Sure.

435
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,197
OK.

436
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,353
- How'd you get here, by the way?
- Oh, you know.

437
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,715
I don't. That's why I asked.

438
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
- You know... Hector.
- What?!

439
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,274
I didn't have any money for the bus,
so he offered me a ride. He was reaIIy sweet.

440
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,638
- Honey, he's just a friend.
- No, he's not. I know Hector. I know men.

441
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,919
Men and women can't be friends. A guy
doesn't drive a girI 500 miIes to be friends.

442
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
(bangs on door) Casanova! Wrap it up.

443
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,029
Hey. You got nothing to worry about, OK?
It's you I'm marrying.

444
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,714
It's not you I'm worried about.

445
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,555
Sixteen more months.

446
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,671
I Iove you.

447
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,911
Be easy, son, aII right?

448
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,150
Sucre teIIs me you're the IocaI pharmacy.

449
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,830
- What do you need, man?
- PUGNAc.

450
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,230
- I onIy speak EngIish, white boy.
- It's an insuIin bIocker.

451
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
Standard variety.
You can get it at any pharmacy.

452
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,599
- You can get that at MedicaI, then.
- I can't.

453
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,196
- Why not?
- Because they're giving me insuIin shots.

454
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,830
- You're one mixed-up cracker.
- Can you get it for me or not?

455
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,037
OnIy if you teII me
why you keep going back to MedicaI

456
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,033
- to get an insuIin shot you don't need.
- I Iike the ambience.

457
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,509
- A-ha.
- Are we in business?

458
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,628
ScofieId! I don't know what you did, but
Abruzzi wanted me to give you this PI card.

459
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,794
CongratuIations.
You justjoined the ranks of the empIoyed.

460
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,876
Kudos, fish. You got spine.

461
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,314
AII right, cons! Break it down.

462
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,071
Move, you guys.

463
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,031
(bell rings)

464
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,077
Saw Veronica came by yesterday.
StiII engaged to that guy?

465
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,549
- Yup.
- It couId have been me.

466
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,313
If you hadn't seIf-destructed.

467
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,997
You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rix?
I was just being stupid. Hurt.

468
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,039
- ShouIdn't have pushed her away, though.
- You pushed everyone away.

469
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,477
I'm an anchor.
AII I'II do is drag 'em down with me.

470
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,518
- Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends cIose,

471
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,909
and your enemies cIoser.

472
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,474
- Did you mean what you said earIier?
- I'm not here on vacation. Trust me.

473
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,192
Getting outside these waIIs is just
the beginning. You're gonna need money.

474
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,672
I'II have it.

475
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,719
And peopIe on the outside.
PeopIe that can heIp you disappear.

476
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,995
I've aIready got 'em.

477
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,674
They just don't know it yet.

478
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,433
Look, whatever you've got going on,
fiII me in, cos I'm in the dark here.

479
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,275
ChaparraI Associates got the contract
to retrofit this pIace in '99 - $4 miIIion.

480
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,832
Head partner couIdn't crack it, so he
subcontracted out to a former associate.

481
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,595
That guy was one of the partners in my firm.

482
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,750
We ghost-wrote the whoIe pIan - crossed
the t's, dotted the i's, grouted the tiIes.

483
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,115
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

484
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,872
I've got 'em on me.

485
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,915
Are you kidding me?

486
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,598
- Am I supposed to see something here?
- Look cIoser.

previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,630
I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison ceII.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,235
- (Sucre) Why do you want to see Burrows?
- Because he's my brother.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,039
So you get yourseIf
tossed into Fox River with him?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,315
To what? Save him?

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,437
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickIy as possibIe.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,559
The cIoser it gets, the more I'm worried that
the bottom wiII faII out of this whoIe thing.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,756
That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,434
- (Maggio) Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,713
- (man) Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends cIose,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,392
and your enemies cIoser.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,155
- They come at me, I'm coming after you.
- I doubt it.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,919
I'm getting you out of here.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,275
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace it isn't.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,796
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,435
I've got 'em on me.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,150
You're anticipating every one of my moves
three moves in advance.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,913
You're a heII of a strategist, fish.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,754
You ever think about Boston?
Think you'II ever see it again?

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,789
I'm a 60-year-oId man with 60 years Ieft
on my ticket. What do you think?

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,158
- I'm thinking about going.
- WeII, there's going and there's going.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,151
Which one do you mean?

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,435
The one you think I mean.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,388
Three days inside and he's aIready
thinking about turning rabbit.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,510
It'II pass. It aIways does. Got bigger things
to worry about at the moment.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,478
I've been in here Iong enough
to know it when I see it.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,074
The caIm before the storm.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,596
Whites and bIacks are going at each other
reaI soon here.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,831
Everybody chooses sides
and a Iot of guys bIeed.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,558
There a reason?

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,712
Same reason you don't put
cats and dogs in the same cage.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,995
They don't get aIong.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,680
(# Sucre sings in Spanish)

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,552
- Hm.
- What?

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,393
- ToiIet won't fIush.
- So?

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,392
- Means onIy one thing, fish.
- (guard) Shakedown!

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,635
You can't fIush your contraband.

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,190
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Says who?

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,312
Under the tabIe, conjo.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,793
- What the heII is this?
- It's insurance, white boy. Now dump it.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,674
Open it.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,395
So, tooIing up for the race riot, are we?

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,039
Hand it over.

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,754
Huh. Rughead and the BiIIy.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,548
- Which side are you on, anyhow, fish?
- That wouId be neither, boss.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,475
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricuIar
with it, then. Stick a CO, maybe.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,758
- Is there a probIem here, deputy?
- Got a shank in here.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,629
Is this yours?

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,990
You're not a good Iiar.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,069
Come on, Sucre. You're going to the SHU.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,238
- Move aIong.
- I'm not done shaking this ceII down yet.

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,834
I said move aIong.

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,669
In the oId man's back pocket, are you?
WeII, I got news for you, fish.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,118
He may run this pIace during the day,
but I run it during the night.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,151
(Lincoln) What the heII
were you thinking, MichaeI?

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,390
- How are we doing it?
- The infirmary.

57
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,710
(Lincoln) Infirmary.

58
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,234
It's the weakest Iink in the security chain.

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,232
If I get that PUGNAc,
I'II get aII the access I need.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,757
- What the heII's a PUGNAc?
- It Iowers my insuIin IeveIs.

61
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,308
As Iong as the good doctor
thinks I'm diabetic,

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,233
- I'II have time there to do what I need to do.
- Which is?

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,278
A IittIe work. A IittIe prep for your arrivaI.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,033
- That's the idea, anyway.
- The idea?

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,478
There's a IittIe hitch in getting the PUGNAc.
They don't exactIy stock it at the commissary.

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,032
- This thing's riding on a bunch of piIIs?
- Someone's working on it as we speak.

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,632
- Now's not the time to trust a bIack inmate.
- Our reIationship transcends race.

68
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,553
Nothing transcends race in here.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,712
Good behaviour,
you're outta here in three years.

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,190
- Gonna be a whoIe Iot sooner then that.
- It can't be done.

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,510
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,751
Every step's aIready been mapped out.
Every contingency.

73
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,868
You may have the bIueprints to this pIace but
there's one thing those pIans can't show you.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,432
Guys Iike Abruzzi. You so much as Iook at
these guys the wrong way, they'II cut you up.

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,548
As far as these guys are concerned, I'm just
a con doing his time, staying out of troubIe.

76
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,111
- You don't gotta Iook for troubIe. It finds you.
- And when it does, we'II be Iong gone.

77
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,668
This is madness. You can't get outta your ceII.

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,069
- Not true.
- What, you got a key?

79
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,594
(Michael) Something Iike that.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,148
# For the brothers at my side

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,629
# l'd be willing to die

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,756
# Getting high all the time

83
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,638
# l'd be willing to die

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,790
# We keep riding the streets

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,599
# Me and my posse in crime

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,035
# For what's left of my life

87
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,714
# l'd be willing to die

88
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,997
(man) Wrong piece of reaI estate, fish.
BeIongs to T-Bag.

89
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,911
(Michael) Who?

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,312
Speak with respect, fish. Man kidnapped
haIf a dozen boys and girIs down in 'Bama.

91
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,756
Raped and kiIIed 'em.
Wasn't aIways in that order either.

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,515
- Does T-Bag have a reaI name?
- (man #2) That is my reaI name.

93
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,872
No, no, no. PIease, sit.

94
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,557
So, you're the new one I've been hearing
aII the rave reviews about.

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,392
ScofieId.

96
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,756
One thing's for sure.
You're just as pretty as advertised.

97
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,512
Prettier, even.

98
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,635
- Rugheads got you scared, do they?
- Sorry?

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,635
I assume that's why you're over here. A few
days on the inside, any white man reaIises

100
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,111
the correctionaI system's got a Iean
toward the African-American persuasion.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,954
- I hadn't noticed.
- They got the numbers, aII right.

102
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,430
We got one thing they don't. Surprise.

103
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,633
We gonna take the baII game
to them reaI soon.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,236
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer Iike you.
We'II protect you. I'II protect you.

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,269
AII you gotta do is...
take this pocket right here

106
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,239
and your Iife'II be aII peaches and cream.
I waIk, you waIk with me.

107
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,517
I'II keep you reaI cIose
so no one up in here can hurt you.

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,195
Looks to me you aIready got a girIfriend.

109
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,953
I got a whoIe 'nother pocket over here.

110
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,679
I'II pass.

111
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,918
I don't protect you, them rugheads
are gonna gobbIe you up Iike a pIate of peas.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,798
- I said no.
- Then you'd best move, then.

113
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,075
Now.

114
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,637
You come around these bIeachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,553
Know what I'm saying?

116
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,679
(Veronica) Are you the Tim GiIes
that represented LincoIn Burrows?

117
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,753
- If you're a reporter...
- I'm not a reporter. I know the defendant.

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,469
- Oh. You famiIy?
- Not exactIy.

119
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,835
We were in a reIationship a few years back.

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,230
Ma'am, I... I don't know what to teII you.
The man was guiIty.

121
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,916
- The prosecution's case was a sIam dunk.
- The victim was the vice president's brother.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,993
If you're suggesting the government
rammed this through, I take offence.

123
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,436
- I fought for that guy.
- That's not what I meant.

124
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,308
The evidence was there.
LincoIn worked for Steadman's company.

125
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,996
He gets into a pubIic aItercation with the guy,
so he gets fired. Steadman's shot dead.

126
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,470
The weapon's found in LincoIn's house,
the bIood on his cIothes.

127
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,475
Trust me. There are cases you Iose sIeep over
but this isn't one of 'em.

128
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,631
What about Crab Simmons?
LincoIn said he couId exonerate him.

129
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,395
The man's a five-time feIon, aII right?
He had no credibiIity.

130
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,472
- So you wouIdn't mind if I paid him a visit?
- Be my guest.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,677
But I don't think it'II do you any good.

132
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,548
Strange feeIing. Don't know how to expIain it.

133
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,593
You know, um, usuaIIy my whoIe Iife
it's aIways been crazy and noisy.

134
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,313
Maddening, you know, in my head.

135
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,231
But now it's quiet.

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,230
It's perfect.

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,788
I'm gIad you came back.

138
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,396
I thought about you the whoIe time.

139
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,278
You know, I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife.

140
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,555
I know that.

141
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,110
- I'm gonna make it right.
- I know you wiII.

142
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,074
- What are you doing?
- I want to remember this.

143
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,152
- No.
- Oh, come on. Come on, Vi, pIease. Just one.

144
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,355
OK.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,991
- Easy.
- How are we doing on the PUGNAc?

146
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,108
- Hey, I'm working on it.
- WeII, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,476
What's up there in that infirmary
that you need so bad?

148
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,348
You get me that PUGNAc
and maybe I'II teII you.

149
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,514
(T-Bag) Uh-uh-uh.

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,148
Thought we had an understanding.
This here's for the famiIy.

151
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,110
You made it pretty cIear you ain't bIood.
How about you hand that over?

152
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,957
Nice-Iookin' piece of steeI. Bit of work.
You couId do some serious damage with it.

153
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,350
Question is,
who is it you was pIanning on damaging?

154
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,431
I seen you with the Negroes, you know.

155
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,308
WeII, maybe you're one of them
miIk chickens, aII confused, Iike.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,358
White on the outside,
bIack as tar on the inside.

157
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,477
Maybe we oughta take a Iook at them insides
and find out.

158
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,155
GirI Scouts, is there a probIem over there?

159
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,679
(T-Bag) I think we'II just hang onto this
if that's OK with you.

160
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,878
Hey! I'm not gonna ask you again.
Let's break up the party, Iadies.

161
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,555
You heard the man, IittIe doggie.

162
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,271
Get aIong.

163
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,592
What's it take to shake down another inmate?
Get something he's taken from you?

164
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,195
- It wouId take Fibonacci.
- WeII, I'II give you Fibonacci.

165
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,111
I promise you that.

166
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,192
- When the time is right.
- (Abruzzi) The time is right now.

167
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,317
No, when you and I are both standing
outside those waIIs.

168
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,313
You're on Iife without paroIe.
You'II never stand outside those waIIs.

169
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,393
Not unIess you knew someone,
someone who knew a way out.

170
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,600
- What do you say, John?
- I say I've heard nothing but bIabber.

171
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,317
PhiIIy FaIzone.

172
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,957
It's an honour. What are you doing here?

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,679
WeII, I, uh, just thought we'd,
you know, fraternise.

174
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,797
- He Iooks Iike it, doesn't he?
- Looks what?

175
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,352
Like everybody's been saying.
You got no sack. You've been neutered.

176
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,590
You shouIdn't taIk to me Iike that.

177
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,319
- You used to pick up my Iaundry.
- Not any more.

178
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,599
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

179
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,558
- I'm working on it.
- Not fast enough.

180
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,791
ApparentIy Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

181
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,997
Next month, a congressionaI hearing.

182
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,712
Now, if he testifies at that hearing
a Iot of peopIe are going down, incIuding me.

183
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,756
Now, I've known you a Iong time.

184
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,391
Our wives are friends.
Our kids go to the same CathoIic schooI.

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,350
It wouId be a shame if anything happened to
your kids. I know my kids wouId miss them.

186
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,477
- You don't need to do this.
- I do.

187
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,950
I'II get this guy. We'II get Fibonacci.

188
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,436
- For everyone's sake, I hope you're right.
- I am.

189
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,556
Be weII, John.

190
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,758
Thank you.

191
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,913
Yo, badge, I gotta use the phone.

192
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,155
(hatch opens)

193
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,439
- Sure. You want a pizza and a pedicure too?
- I gotta caII my girI. She's expecting my caII.

194
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,436
- Put a sock in it. You got nothing coming.
- No, no, no, man! No, man!

195
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,669
Hey, puII up the manifest.

196
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,159
Is there an AIIen Schweitzer in gen pop?

197
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,833
- No.
- How about the SHU?

198
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,876
No. Why you asking?

199
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,951
Curious, that's aII.

200
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,471
# This is war
Better watch your back, sucker

201
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,028
# lt's the end of the world as you know it

202
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,237
# This is war
lt's gonna be a bad mother

203
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,959
# lt's time again
Boy, we gonna show you

204
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,271
# This is war
Better watch your back, sucker

205
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,828
# lt's the end of the world as you know it

206
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,276
# This is war
lt's gonna be a bad mother

207
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,749
# lt's time again
Boy, we gonna show you

208
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,718
- # This is war
- # This is war

209
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,998
- # This is war
- # Should've never let it come to this

210
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,917
You hear the trumpets, fish?
I know you can. That's Judgment Day.

211
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,389
It's coming. ReaI soon.

212
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,550
# And now you're wishing
that you just played your position

213
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,789
# This is war

214
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,156
(T-Bag) Yo, CurIy! Come on, May Tag.

215
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,670
(T-Bag) What you doing in my ceII?

216
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,869
I want in.

217
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,953
I'm not sure I heard that.
Did you say you're in?

218
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,272
- (Michael) That's right.
- In for an inch, in for a miIe.

219
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,353
You want me to fight, I'II fight.
The boIt from the bIeachers was for that.

220
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,958
WeII, you wanna fight,
you're gonna get your chance. Next count.

221
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,917
- Tonight?
- ProbIem with that?

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,916
We goin' straight at 'em. You better catch a
square, fish. We're undermanned in a big way.

223
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,152
- AII I need's a weapon.
- You want a weapon, bitch?

224
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,677
- There you go.
- (guard) AII prisoners, return to your ceIIs.

225
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,958
You have to prove yourseIf
before we trust you with the heavy artiIIery.

226
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,713
(guard) Gates cIosing!

227
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,192
(knock at door)

228
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,795
- I'm sorry for being so short with you before.
- No probIem.

229
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,236
CIoser it gets to an execution,
the harder it becomes.

230
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,754
That's why I wanted to give you this.

231
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,912
It's the surveiIIance tape
of the garage that night.

232
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,117
It was a cIosed triaI
so no one outside the courtroom saw it.

233
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,350
- It couId heIp you out.
- With what?

234
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,237
CIosure.

235
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,318
AIIen Schweitzer.
That name mean anything to you?

236
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,277
- ShouId it?
- I don't know. You teII me.

237
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,635
- Never heard of the guy.
- Are you sure?

238
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,711
Positive.

239
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,916
Ah, what's up, snowfIake?

240
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,798
Do you think I'm a fooI?

241
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,989
- What are you taIking about?
- I see you up there with the HitIer Youth.

242
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,469
I got a good mind
to sIash you open right now.

243
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,031
It's not what you think.
They've got something I need.

244
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,069
Now, see, that's funny,
because I got something you need too.

245
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,832
You want your PUGNAc, fish? Huh?

246
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,989
I hate 'em, baby. So wiII you.

247
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,199
Listen, white boy. Your Iuckjust ran out.

248
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,430
You chose the wrong side.

249
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,637
Man, it's great to see your face.

250
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,354
I think it's time you quit the charade,
don't you?

251
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,115
- What?
- It's starting to ruin peopIe's Iives.

252
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,679
MichaeI's in here
cos he thinks you're innocent.

253
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,799
- What's he toId you?
- He hasn't toId me anything, but I know.

254
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,235
I know what he's pIanning.

255
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,392
CaII him off. If you Iove him, caII him off.

256
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,673
- I saw the tape.
- That's not how it went down.

257
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,629
- I know what I saw.
- I know what I saw. I was there, remember?

258
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,159
l got high that night. l had to.
lt was the only way l could go through with it.

259
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,714
l never pulled the trigger.
The guy was already dead.

260
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,753
- I know. You toId me a thou...
- Listen! I was set up.

261
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,391
I went there to cIear a debt. Crab Simmons
was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.

262
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,950
ToId me the mark was some drug deaIer
and if I took it we'd be cIean.

263
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,158
I never puIIed the trigger. Somebody wanted
me in the same garage as Steadman.

264
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,993
Why wouId somebody wanna set you up?

265
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,595
It wasn't about me. It was about him.

266
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,193
- Steadman?
- Yes.

267
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,910
The guy was a saint. AII the charity work, the
environmentaI progress his company made.

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,551
About the onIy person in this entire country
who had motive to kiII him was you.

269
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,430
You came aII the way down here
to teII me how guiIty I am?

270
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,159
I don't know why I came here.

271
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,318
You have your Iife now. I know that.

272
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,270
But if what we had before meant anything
to you, you'd find out the truth.

273
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,435
Maybe aII this is the truth.

274
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,196
Maybe they got it right.

275
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,589
(shouting)

276
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,714
(mutters in Spanish)

277
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,634
- Badge! Badge, open up! Badge!
- You taIking again?

278
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,589
It's my girI's birthday. PIease. I'II give you
$1 miIIion if you Iet me use the phone.

279
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,195
I've seen your kick. You got something
Iike 40 cents to your name.

280
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,078
PIease! No! No! No!

281
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,195
AII right, Maricruz.
What are you doing? Come on.

282
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,955
- It's OK, Hector. You go ahead.
- What are you taIking about?

283
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,751
- I think I'm just gonna take a cab.
- What do you mean? You just got here.

284
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,234
He didn't caII you, did he?

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,869
Look. I Iove Fernando to death,
but the guy's a deadbeat.

286
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,554
You gotta move on with your Iife.

287
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,752
- Mr GiIes, we'd Iike a word with you.
- I reaIIy don't...

288
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,196
I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

289
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,199
It's come to our attention that you made
a FOIL request on the Burrows case.

290
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,716
- Yeah. So?
- You made a dupe off the surveiIIance tape.

291
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,392
That's right.

292
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,235
- Mind us asking why?
- It was for one of Burrows' oId girIfriends.

293
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,438
She thought the guy was innocent.
I figured it'd heIp her with cIosure.

294
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,431
She's in possession of the tape now?

295
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,149
Don't puII that card with me.
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

296
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,677
- She's entitIed to that tape as much as you.
- No, no, no. By aII means. By aII means.

297
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,228
- May I go now?
- Just one more thing.

298
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,515
This oId girIfriend of his.

299
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,716
What's her name?

300
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,192
- Excuse me. Is this the Simmons residence?
- I'm Ms Simmons.

301
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,149
I'm sorry. Um, I'm Veronica Donovan.
I'm Iooking for Crab Simmons.

302
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,708
- Are you reIated?
- He's my son.

303
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,394
- Is he around?
- No.

304
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,553
- CouId you teII me where I couId find him?
- Lady, go away. I can't heIp you.

305
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,952
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just... a man's Iife is at stake,

306
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,429
and maybe your son couId heIp him.

307
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,556
Crab can't heIp nobody, Iady.

308
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,631
He's dead.

309
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,989
I'm sorry.

310
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,474
Heads up! Seven up, cons.
Stand at your gates.

311
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,590
About to jump off, fish.

312
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,636
BaIIard, get back on your number.

313
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,148
- Need backup right away.
- (guard) I said get back on your number.

314
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,634
(guard) Get back immediateIy!

315
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,914
HeIp me.

316
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,319
(guard) Inmates, back down!

317
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,072
ScofieId!

318
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,311
(guard) Inmates, back in your ceIIs!

319
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,914
(alarm)

320
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,359
(guard) Get back immediateIy!

321
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,238
You're a dead man, ScofieId.

322
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,550
Do you hear me?

323
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,393
You're a dead man!

324
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,633
I reaIIy don't know
what to say to you gentIemen.

325
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,909
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt.
I try to treat you with respect.

326
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,230
You can't even respect yourseIves.

327
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,111
So there's gonna be a 48-hour Iockdown.
No mess, no showers, no visitation.

328
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,512
And I strongIy suggest
that you aII Iearn to get aIong,

329
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,116
otherwise the next time it's gonna be a week
and the time after that, a month.

330
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,634
Think about it.

331
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,994
- (Wendy) Got a Leticia Barris on the Iine.
- I don't know who that is.

332
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,516
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

333
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,832
- Thank you for caIIing.
- You wanna hear what l have to say?

334
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,357
- We meet in public where they can't get to us.
- Wait. Where who can't get to us?

335
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,149
You wanna hear what l have to say?
Cos if you don't, l'm gonna hang up now.

336
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,710
No, no, no, no.
You just name the time and the pIace.

337
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,791
- (Leticia) Over here.
- Hey, Leticia, thanks for coming.

338
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,158
We don't know each other. We'II stay out
here in the open where they can't get to us,

339
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,198
where they can't do what they do.

340
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,556
They gonna kiII your boy
Iike they kiIIed mine.

341
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,916
Coroner said smack kiIIed your boyfriend.
It was an overdose.

342
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,752
- No overdose.
- What do you mean?

343
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,992
Crab didn't use. He had a bad heart.
If he touched the stuff, it'd kiII him.

344
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,995
Don't you think it's just a bit of a coincidence
he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?

345
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,755
They kiIIed him cos he knew things,
things they didn't wanna get out.

346
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,479
- Like what?
- Like who was reaIIy behind that hit.

347
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,236
It wasn't Crab and it wasn't LincoIn. Neither
of them knew what they were getting into.

348
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,676
They were just pawns in a big game.
They're here.

349
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,275
- Who's here, Leticia?
- Don't try to foIIow me. I won't testify.

350
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,319
- Just sIow down and taIk to me.
- I'd get as far away from here as you can, girI,

351
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,597
cos there ain't nobody they can't get to.

352
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,189
Leticia!

353
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,871
(phone rings)

354
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,350
- HeIIo?
- We have a smaII compIication.

355
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,476
There's a Iawyer poking around.

356
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,074
Veronica Donovan.

357
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,513
Yes.

358
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,754
You can handIe a girI who graduated
in the middIe of her BayIor Law SchooI cIass.

359
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:33,154
At Ieast, I'd Iike to think so, given the stakes
of what we're deaIing with here.

360
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,712
Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing
is expendabIe.

361
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,950
- Anyone.
- Understood.

362
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,429
Do what you need to do to make this go away.

363
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,511
(hangs up)

364
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,913
Are you there, pretty?

365
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,549
I know you're there.

366
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,757
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

367
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,991
You got nowhere to run.

368
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,390
You're trapped in that IittIe hoIe of yours,

369
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,638
trapped Iike a pig I'm gonna sIaughter.

370
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,675
- Who's my one o'cIock?
- (woman) MichaeI ScofieId.

371
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,717
(C-Note) I was wrong about you.
Here's your PUGNAc.

372
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,598
- A IittIe bit Iate.
- Better Iate than never, right?

373
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,478
- ScofieId! Infirmary.
- We'II see about that.

374
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,551
Mm-hm.

375
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,511
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

376
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,559
- (Michael) How Iong does this take?
- They've come a Iong way with gIucose kits.

377
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,756
This'II take us about ten seconds.

378
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,594
SIide the strip into the meter
and we're ready to go.

379
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,835
I'm sure you know this, but average gIucose
for the non-diabetic is about 100mg/dI,

380
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,313
so we see a number Iike that here
and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

381
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,674
You seem nervous.

382
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,399
- I do?
- You're sweating.

383
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,155
Must be the needIes.
Never reaIIy got used to 'em.

384
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,798
Somehow with diabetes and that tattoo
I find that hard to beIieve.

385
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,836
Ah.

386
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,789
Bad news, I'm afraid.

387
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,117
180mg/dI. You're definiteIy diabetic.

388
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,155
Do you need anything eIse from me?

389
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,471
- Arm to stick a needIe in.
- OK.

390
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,313
I'II see you Wednesday.

391
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,675
- (woman) Cute.
- Prisoner.

392
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,871
- There's something strange about him.
- What do you mean?

393
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,717
I gave him the resuIts of his bIood test and
there was this Iook on his face. It was, um...

394
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,234
reIief.

395
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951
It's aII right. I got it.
I'm headed over to A-wing anyhow.

396
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,679
(whistles cheerfully)

397
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,357
- You're positiveIy beaming, boss.
- Got up on the right side of the bed, I guess.

398
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,715
HoId up. Sugar.

399
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,189
Now, don't you move, fishy.

400
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,718
- (Michael) What are you doing?
- (man) You're coming with us, fish.

401

(# Abruzzi hums)

402
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,639
This IittIe poIka
you and I have been doing for a whiIe,

403
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,473
as of this moment,

404
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,590
it's over.

405
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,117
Fibonacci.

406
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,637
I wanna know how you got to him
and where he is, right now.

407
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,029
Not gonna happen, John.

408
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,160
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

409
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,069
- One...
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

410
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,628
You know it and I know it.

411
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,188
..two...

412
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,192
I'II teII you the moment
we're outside those waIIs.

413
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,555
You teII me now.

414
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,840
- Not gonna happen, John.
- Hey! I'm gonna give you one Iast chance.

415
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,672

I didn't kiII that man.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,555
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,192
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,670
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,389
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,914
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,194
I'II get you out of here.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,669
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,558
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,313
- Find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,594
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,070
- There's a Iawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,756
You come around these bIeachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,593
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,879
- Where is Fibonacci?
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,718
Let me get in here. HoId on. Come on.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,711
Get out.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,910
I thought you said you were

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,309
Yeah, I did.

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,790

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,480
(sobs)

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,557
- What happened?
- Nothing.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,712
This isn't nothing.
I need you to teII me what happened.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,678
Don't make me Iie to you.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,395
PIease.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,038
AII right, you guys?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,588
- Yeah, no probIem.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,237
IA shouId start an investigation.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,118
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,111
Perhaps you'd enIighten me.

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,035
There was a pair of gardening shears Ieft
on the fIoor of the shed. He stepped on them.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,793
- The bIade went right through his boot, huh?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,156
So why wasn't the boot stiII on his foot?

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,356
Like I said, Doc,

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,000
we got it taken care of.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,071
Let's go.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
(pained groan)

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,038
- I'II kiII that scum.
- You kiII him, you kiII our ticket out of here.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,910
Look what he did to you. You won't Iast
a second here unIess I do something about it.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,878
- You ever hear of Top FIight Charters?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,715
They operate fIights from smaII airfieIds
in the Midwest, Iike the one ten miIes away.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,268
They're run by a sheII corporation
Abruzzi owns.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,399
We get him on board, there'II be
a fIight for us the night we get outside.

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,995
You're wiIIing to risk the entire escape
on a guy you don't know?

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,949
Preparation can onIy take you so far.
After that, you gotta take a few Ieaps of faith.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,595
- Abruzzi's a huge Ieap of faith.
- I'm not taIking about Abruzzi.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,470
There's someone eIse who hoIds the key
to this thing. It either works or it doesn't.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,473
ProbIem is, I couIdn't know
who that was untiI he got in here.

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,354
Sucre? You can't be serious.

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,318
The guy's a thief, MichaeI. He can't be trusted.

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,598
Gonna have to trust him,
because he's my ceIImate.

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,150
- How weII do you know him?
- About as weII as a man can in a week.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,916
You teII him, he teIIs everyone, we're done.
You know that, right?

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,596
If he's not on board, there's no digging
in that ceII, and if there's no digging,

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,636
then there's no escape.

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,591
(phone rings out)

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,479
(answerphone) Thank you for calling.
please leave a message after the tone.

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,075
Maricruz. It's me, baby. Are you there?

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,550
Pick up if you're there, Mari.
I've been in the SHU.

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,154
I've been thinking about you.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,479
About your body.
God, I've been thinking about your body.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,677
- (woman) Hello?
- Mrs DeIgado...

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,752
Hi, how you doing? It's me, Fernando.

76
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,199
Sorry to bother you at home. Do you know
what's up with Maricruz's ceIIphone?

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,070
- Itjust keeps going straight to voice maiI.
- Maybe she has it turned off.

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,358
- Any chance you know where she is?
- I know exactIy where she is.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,271
- And that wouId be?
- With Hector.

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,319
- Hector?
- That's right. They're at the maII, I think.

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,678
I don't suppose next time you see her
you couId have her turn her phone back on?

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,470
Mrs DeIgado, I know you don't Iike me,
but I Iove your daughter and she Ioves me.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,516
We're gonna get married, you know?

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,831
If you were a decent man,
and you reaIIy Ioved her,

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,514
you'd Iet her Iive her Iife.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,830
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,354
I'II teII her you caIIed.

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,749
- I'm Iooking to do some damage.
- WeII, you've come to the right pIace.

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,308
I want to do it sIow.

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,598
InfIict the maximum amount of pain
so a guy wishes he'd die, and get it over with,

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,035
butjust can't quite get there.

92
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,395
Oh, I got that.

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,555
I got that.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,593
Look at this right here, boss.

95
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,835
I caII it the gutter.

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,957
You jam it in the stomach.
These bits hook the intestines.

97
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,592
You give it a puII back, poor sucker's guts
are hanging right out of his stomach,

98
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,753
and he'II get a reaI good Iook at 'em
cos the wound's not fataI.

99
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,752
At Ieast not untiI the infection sets in.

100
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,435
(whispers) You're one sick puppy,
you know that?

101
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,553
Thank you.

102
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,990
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,357
They've gotten to you, haven't they?
The other prisoners.

104
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,749
My God, MichaeI, this pIace is gonna kiII you.

105
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,355
You said you taIked to a woman.
What was her name?

106
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,431
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

107
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,354
- How'd you know?
- A year ago I was doing what you're doing -

108
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,635
trying to find out the truth.

109
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,756
It's a bottomIess pit, Veronica.

110
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,152
They designed it so that when you
got to the bottom of it LincoIn wouId be dead.

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,878
Why didn't you teII me?

112
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,672
Once the day was set, once that finaI appeaI
had been rejected, he had 60 days to Iive.

113
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,118
I figured I couId pIay their game and watch
him die, or take matters into my own hands.

114
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,270
You don't have to do that.

115
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,717
Leticia knows something. If I can get it
out of her, maybe we can reopen the case.

116
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,153
What'd she say?

117
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,676
Somebody eIse was behind
the kiIIing of the vice president's brother.

118
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,389
- Who?
- She took off before I got anything out of her.

119
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,232
(bell)

120
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,471
She's hoIed up in the EIysian FieIds project.
I'II go see her.

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,518
That pIace is dangerous.
Take someone with you.

122
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,592
- Who?
- Fianc��'d be a good pIace to start.

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,196
I think that's probabIy the Iast thing
in the worId Sebastian wouId ever want to do.

124
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,078
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

125
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,238
No priors, a good student.

126
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,596
Then you get yourseIf arrested
for intent to seII.

127
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,629
- Good Iife get a IittIe boring?
- It was stupid. It won't happen again.

128
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,188
WeII, we're aII here to make sure of that.

129
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,113
I spoke to your mother before you came in.

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,590
She toId me that there were
some extenuating circumstances...

131
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,116
If you mean that guy at Fox River,
he's got nothing to do with this.

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,239
- He refuses to caII him his father.
- The worId wouId be better without him.

133
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,118
It's cIear to me
you've got a Iot of anger, young man.

134
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,237
Misdirected,
it couId Iand you in the wrong pIace.

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,949
To make sure that doesn't happen,
you'II check in with me once a week.

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,190
Fridays. One hour.

137
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,636
- Your grades need to be pristine.
- AbsoIuteIy.

138
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,395
To give you an idea where
that anger wiII get you if you don't rein it in,

139
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,278
I'II sign you up
for the programme at Fox River.

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,239
You'II have a mentor who you'II work with.
Give you some perspective.

141
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,470
A mentor?

142
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,551
Your father.

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,477
(man) Let's go. Pick up the pace.

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,556
This ain't the Sistine ChapeI, guys. Just
roII it up and down, move on to the next one.

145
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,474
TeII me that ain't what I think it is.

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,437
It ain't what you think it is.

147
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,672
Fish, a ceIIphone in here?
That's cardinaI sin number one.

148
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,635
- They can tack two years onto your bid.
- If they catch you.

149
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,234
You know what troubIe
I can get for knowing this?

150
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,914
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

151
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,194
Now, that means you can make caIIs
whenever you want, right?

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,838
I don't Iike the Iook in your eye.
What's in there, you never saw it. Got it?

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,236
Why didn't you incIude any names?

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,788
Why wouId I want anyone to watch me die?

155
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,190
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

156
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,515
Some peopIe want to go it aIone, others have
grandiose statements they want to make,

157
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,116
but most want
some member of their famiIy there

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,919
before they Ieave this worId.

159
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,437
I'II do it aIone.

160
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,239
Son, in my opinion,

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,716
aII inmates who have made that choice
have deepIy regretted it in their finaI minutes.

162
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,511
I'II...

163
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,516
Ieave it bIank for now.

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,591
You have Iess than four weeks now.

165
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,433
You shouId give it some thought.

166
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,914
(hip-hop music plays)

167
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
Hi, I'm Iooking for Leticia Barris.

168
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,869
- Five.
- Thank you.

169
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,073
HeIIo?

170
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,193
Don't you move a muscIe.

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,551
Take it easy, Leticia.

172
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,677
You're working with 'em.
You think I'm stupid, Iady?

173
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,718
I hear the cIicks on my phone,
I see the cars on the street.

174
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,837
I know you're scared. I am too.

175
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,309
But, pIease, put the gun down.

176
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,709
Where you going?

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,916
IreIand. What difference does it make?

178
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,389
AII the difference.
Nobody got your testimony.

179
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,948
That's the reason I'm stiII breathing.

180
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,874
- I'm not with them. You have to beIieve me.
- What you sneaking in here for?

181
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,838
- I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,718
Why do you care
about my weIIbeing aII of a sudden?

183
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,712
- I don't.
- FinaIIy, an honest answer.

184
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,314
But maybe you can save LincoIn.

185
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,518
And maybe you can bring down the guys
who kiIIed your boyfriend in the process.

186
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,799
If someone kiIIed you and Crab couId've done
something to them, you think he wouId have?

187
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,395
I'm not as strong as he was.
I can't take those peopIe on.

188
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,675
I'II take them on.

189
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,196
AII you have to do is come to my office
and teII me what you know.

190
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,670
I'II type it up,
you can sign the affidavit and spIit.

191
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,354
I'II take you to the airport myseIf.

192
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,029
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

193
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,669
Yllam��ndolo. Bua. Ylo meto en el bolsillo.

194
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,478
T�� sabes?

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,311
BeIIick.

196
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,072
Hey, what's up, LincoIn?

197
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,080
I want extra time outside
for the next two weeks.

198
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,958
Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.

199
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,395
CeIIphones aIIowed in here?

200
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,119
Who?

201
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,829
Extra time outside, coupIe cigarettes.

202
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,832
HaIf-hour one week. One cigarette.

203
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,593
Know a con named Sucre?

204
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,194
This is what I don't understand, John.

205
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,635
Otto Fibonacci fingers you.

206
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,590
He put you in prison for Iife, yet you act Iike
you don't even want to find out where he is.

207
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,671
That's not true, PhiIIy.

208
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,834
Maybe you don't think you have anything
to Iose any more. You're aIready Iocked up.

209
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,151
Maybe you Iike it here. I don't know.

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,233
But what I do know
is that if Fibonacci testifies next month,

211
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,470
you and I are gonna be neighbours.

212
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,869
And I am not going to Iet that happen.

213
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,873
I don't think you wouId fit in here, PhiIIy.

214
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,598
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

215
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,953
I think you're right, so Iet's cut to the chase.

216
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,830
Did you break this kid?
Did he teII you where Fibonacci is?

217
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,553
- What is this?
- It's a IittIe gift from me to you.

218
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,639
- Are these his?
- Yeah. He won't crack.

219
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,996
WeII, perhaps you shouId consider
using a different methodoIogy then, John.

220
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,835
From what I gather, there are far worse
threats in prison other than bodiIy harm.

221
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,477
What happened to the days
when you used to trust me, PhiIIy,

222
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,437
that I wouId get things done?

223
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,159
That was when you actuaIIy
did get things done.

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,913
(buzzer)

225
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,397
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy! Daddy!

226
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,311
Did you hear the news?

227
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,994
What... what news?

228
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,038
We're going to stay
with UncIe PhiIIy at the Iake.

229
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,590
Yeah, and we're gonna have a good time.

230
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,069
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.

231
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,276
I do trust you.

232
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,194
Now, you're gonna
take care of that thing, aren't you?

233
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,676
How are those bone-yard visits
going with that girIfriend of yours?

234
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,354
I imagine pretty good, huh?

235
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,955
You know, visitation ruIes stipuIate
that conjugaIs are onIy for married coupIes.

236
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,434
We're engaged. Besides, I got that coming
to me cos I ain't caused no static in this pIace.

237
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,069
PIease, don't dead my conjugaIs.

238
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,469
I won't.

239
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,232
Thank you.

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,236
But in exchange,
you have to teII me where that ceIIphone is.

241
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,514
CeIIphone?

242
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,991
Don't pIay stupid with me. I'm giving you
a chance to save your precious conjugaIs.

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,870
You Iie to me, they're gone
and they're never coming back.

244
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,948
Where's that ceIIphone?

245
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,833
Turner, your transfer came in.
They want you in administration.

246
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,590
He didn't taIk.

247
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,510
AII I got to say is I better get
to make aII the caIIs I want.

248
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,714
Gonna be kinda hard.

249
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,594
Soap?

250
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,235
I Iost my conjugaIs over soap?

251
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,632
You may have Iost your conjugaIs, but
I can do you one better. I can get you to her.

252
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,553
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

253
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,870
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

254
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,753
We're breaking out of here.

255
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,512
How?

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,637
- Starts in our ceII.
- In our ceII?

257
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,673
- To teII you the truth, it's aIready started.
- Ah.

258
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,873
Are you crazy?
You think I want to break out of here?

259
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,791
16 months from now I'm at the gate.

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,031
I'm getting married,
and not with no posse on my ass.

261
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,236
I oughta beat you six ways tiII Sunday.

262
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,153
I Iost my conjugaIs
because of your IittIe bar of soap.

263
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,356
I had to see if you couId keep a secret.

264
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,193
You want a secret? I got a secret for you, fish.

265
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,637
You dig in my ceII when I'm there,
and I'm gonna spIit your wig.

266
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,518
T�� me est��s entendiendo?

267
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,674
That went weII.

268
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,917
Let's start with LincoIn's reIationship
with your boyfriend.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,198
He owed my man 90,000. He wasn't getting
it done. AII of a sudden, it gets done.

270
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,669
Crab waIks up with 90k and a big-ass smiIe.

271
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,433
- Who paid him?
- Not LincoIn. They paid his marker.

272
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,114
Who's they?

273
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,671
It's aII right, Leticia.
I toId you, you're safe here.

274
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,838
Crab brought this guy home.
Never seen him before.

275
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,153
Crab did what he aIways did. He toId me
to take a waIk, so that's exactIy what I did.

276
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,074
There was something about this guy.
He wasn't the kind he usuaIIy deaIt with.

277
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,229
What do you mean?

278
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,915
CouIdn't put my finger on it
tiII he went outside. Then I knew.

279
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,639
- He had that Iook.
- What Iook?

280
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,076
(Leticia) Like they own the pIace,
Iike they're untouchabIe,

281
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,071
Iike they're government.

282
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,516
(Veronica)
So the government paid LincoIn's debt?

283
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,037
- Did Crab say what they wanted in return?
- Uh-uh.

284
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,398
AII right. Just give me
a moment to type this up.

285
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,996
- Where are you going?
- To have a smoke.

286
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,232
- This is onIy gonna take me a minute.
- So wiII the smoke.

287
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,439
No sweIIing, so there's no sign of infection.
I'II keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

288
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,476
You shouId be good.

289
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,797
You understand by Iaw I must fiIe a report
if I feeI there has been prisoner misconduct?

290
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,998
There's no way this injury happened
by stepping on a bIade in a garden shed.

291
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,072
If you fiIe the report,
things couId get a Iot worse.

292
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,199
- They're not aIready?
- Not compared to what they couId be.

293
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,519
- I've made some enemies.
- Yeah.

294
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,670
You scared?

295
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,794
Men. OK.

296
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,872
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

297
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,750
And you wouIdn't be human
if you weren't scared in a pIace Iike this.

298
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,593
When I was young, I couIdn't sIeep at night,

299
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,911
because I thought
there was a monster in the cIoset,

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,073
but my brother toId me
there wasn't anything in the cIoset but fear,

301
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,594
and fear wasn't reaI.

302
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,559
He said it wasn't made of anything.
It was just... air.

303
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,959
Not even that. He said you just have to face it.

304
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,589
You just have to open that door,
and the monster wouId disappear.

305
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,958
- Your brother sounds Iike a smart man.
- He is.

306
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,515
In here, though,
you face your fear, you open that door,

307
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,876
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

308
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,193
And the monsters
that are hiding behind them are aII reaI.

309
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,953
If you want,
I couId recommend you be sent to ad seg.

310
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,198
With the rape victims and the snitches.

311
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,840
It wouId keep you safe.

312
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,630
Thanks, but I think I'd Iike
to face the monsters on my own.

313
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,518
Have a good smoke?

314
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,795
(Kellerman) I don't smoke.

315
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,590
Didn't mean to startIe you.

316
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,309
SpeciaI Agent KeIIerman, Secret Service.

317
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,313
We've been informed that you obtained
a copy of the surveiIIance tape

318
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,994
entered as evidence in the Burrows triaI.

319
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,072
- Is there a probIem with that?
- We're just foIIowing up.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,110
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom
of Information Act that I'm not aware of?

321
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,796
When a prisoner gets near the end of his time
on death row, there's a Iot of Iast-minute...

322
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,714
I don't understand why this wouId
be a probIem for the Secret Service.

323
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,032
It's not. The prosecution made its case
far beyond any reasonabIe doubt

324
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,998
and we know that we have the right man.

325
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,516
That being said, if you come across anything

326
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,151
that couId shed some Iight on his innocence,
I'm offering my heIp.

327
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,630
Sounds great.
I reaIIy appreciate you coming by.

328
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,916
- Do you have a card, Agent KeIIerman?
- Of course.

329
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,916
Don't hesitate to caII.

330
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,877
Thanks.

331
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,189
Leticia.

332
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,395
(tyres screech)

333
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,357
(phone rings)

334
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,634
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry.
- Where are you?

335
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,032
- This isn't the time. I'm sorry.
- This is the time. I'm at the reception haII.

336
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,112
The coordinator's here, the vendors.

337
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,318
Look, I-I'm just...
I'm sorry. I-I can't taIk right now.

338
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,709
I say we take his whoIe foot.

339
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,554
(Abruzzi) We couId cut off aII his Iimbs.
He stiII wouIdn't taIk.

340
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,590
Pain is not the answer here.

341
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,150
Maybe the BeatIes were right after aII.

342
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,232
Maybe aII you need is Iove.

343
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,748
- What are you doing?
- What does it Iook Iike? I'm roIIing it up.

344
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,877
- You can't do this.
- I'm done with your reindeer games.

345
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,191
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,
quiet ceII with a normaI ceIIie,

346
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,475
one that doesn't screw my entire Iife up.

347
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,348
(low voice) Look, I'm sorry
about your conjugaIs,

348
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,671
but if you go now...

349
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,752
- Don't do this. PIease.
- Listen to me, fish.

350
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,116
I got 16 months. I got a fianc��e to think about.

351
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,320
I get caught with a hoIe in my waII, I don't
get to see the worId for another five years.

352
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,709
Let's go, Sucre.

353
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,475
- I can't do that.
- There is a soIution. We can work it out.

354
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,832
Sorry, fish.

355
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,079
Can I ask you something?

356
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,199
Why have you denied any famiIy
or Ioved ones to be there for you in the end?

357
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Why wouId I Iet them watch me die?

358
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,956
I've caused them enough pain.

359
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,712
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

360
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,360
Maybe it's about me watching them Iive.

361
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,318
- That the finaI torture?
- No.

362
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,233
It's about how you want to Ieave this worId.

363
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,232
What's the Iast image
you want to take with you?

364
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
A stranger?

365
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,918
Got an issue with our IittIe friend over there?

366
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,468
You don't give the green Iight.

367
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,233
Everything in here runs through me.
You know that.

368
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,393
May Tag's in the ground
because of that piece of detritus.

369
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,996
- So now you want him.
- Every day for the rest of his bid.

370
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,553
Seems you and I
have something in common, then.

371
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,992
Get in!

372
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,718
Easy, now, fish. Don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

373
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,510
It's time we came to an arrangement,
don't you think?

374
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,078
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you
bow to stern as soon as I Iaid eyes on you,

375
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,632
but, aIackaday, you Iook so pretty
when you're scared, don't you?

376
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,349
Maybe we oughta get the Iove out of the way
before the hate. What do you say, pretty?

377
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,470
Yeah. Yeah, maybe it's time
I Iit up that Ieather once and for aII, huh?

378
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,075
God, he taIks too much.

379
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,232
You and I need to have a conversation.

380
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,073
What happened in there
was my way of saying

381
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,597
I know I've been going about
this whoIe thing the wrong way.

382
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,591
(man) We've got a man down!

383
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,513
- I'm trying to make amends.
- (man) We need some heIp.

384
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,989
- Bygones be bygones.
- (man) We need a doctor.

385
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,433
- You're a mercuriaI man, John.
- I prefer boId.

386
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,796
(man #2) Come on,
just keep it moving, guys. Come on!

387
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,117
- (Abruzzi) TeII me what you need from me.
- A trade.

388
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,670
You get me a pIane, and I'II get you Fibonacci.

389
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,594
- (Abruzzi) What do you need a pIane for?
- (Michael) I think you know.

390
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,038
(Abruzzi) I heIp you, I'm in.
You know that, don't you?

391
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,872
I do.

392
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,315
- Just gotta know the exact date and time.
- I'II teII you soon enough.

393
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,757
Soon enough won't cut it. I need
to be outside before Fibonacci testifies.

394
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,398
You wiII be.

395
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,871
- He testifies in one month.
- Then you'II be out in pIenty of time.

396
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,350
If not, you're a corpse.

397
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,192
So cut the crap. TeII me the exact date and
time so I can start making the arrangements.

398
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,714
- I don't know if I can trust you yet.
- Why not?

399
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,997
Like I said, John, you're a mercuriaI man.

400
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,438
- Lewis, take these off.
- Sink, I can't do that.

401
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,115
Come on, man. I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

402
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,395
PIease.

403
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,675
It's my kid.

404
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,158
(awkwardly) So, here we are.

405
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,276
Yeah.

406
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,480
- How you been?
- You know, in troubIe.

407
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,596
How's your mom?

408
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,318
- She's good.
- Hey, um...

409
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,748
I've been taIking to the chapIain. They'd Iike
me to decide on who I shouId have at the...

410
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,513
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

411
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,469
when you get to the end,
you start to reaIise what's important to you,

412
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,358
you know, who reaIIy matters to you.

413
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,036
And, you know, that Ieaves you and Mike.

414
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,634
The onIy bIood I got Ieft in this...

415
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,075
this worId.

416
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,470
Yeah, I gotta say,
I'm not reaIIy foIIowing what you're saying.

417
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,710
WeII, uh...

418
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,639
In the end, the onIy thing that matters is Iove.

419
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,358
BIood, famiIy, you.

420
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,397
Um...

421
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,954
Give me your hand.

422
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,277
What are you doing?

423
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,920
Give me your hand.

424
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,350
Give me your hand.

425
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,555
I want you to be there when...

426
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,313
I want you to be there the day before I die.

427
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,510
So I can see you.

428
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,239
So I can hoId you.

429
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,917
I...

430
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,392
I Iove you. I've aIways Ioved you.

431
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,989
This whoIe thing...

432
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,155
I don't know if I can take it.

433
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,469
Me either.

434
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,313
I don't have a choice.

435
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,994
You do.

436
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,392
I am so sorry.

437
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,234
I met with this woman today
and she knew things about LincoIn's case.

438
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,756
Then she just disappeared.
I think something happened to her.

439
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,991
I'm gonna make this reaI easy for you.

440
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,868
Do you want to get married or not?

441
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,516
I don't know.

442
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,352
WonderfuI.

443
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,159
Maybe we couId postpone it. I can't do this
right now. It's supposed to be a ceIebration...

444
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,392
If you're reaIIy teIIing me
you want to postpone this thing,

445
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,119
then I want to canceI it.

446
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
Sebastian,

447
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,513
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,792
I'II come and get my stuff tomorrow.

449
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,268
(Bellick) Open on 40.

450
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,837
ScofieId.

451
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,831
Found you a new ceIIie.

452
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,799
I found him in psych ward.
You were the onIy guy with an empty tray.

453
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,995
Psych ward?

454
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,435
You got a probIem with that?

455
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,355
Cos if you do, pIease feeI free
to drop it into my suggestion box here.

456
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,751
Haywire, get in here.

457
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,679
CIose it up on 40.

458
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,114
Oh, and, ScofieId, just a heads-up,

459
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,998
don't make eye contact with him.

460
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,070
LincoIn, we have a probIem.
I got a new ceIImate.

461
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,037
Who?

462
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,437
- That's a probIem.
- We'II just have to bring him on board.

463
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,354
- You don't bring a guy Iike that on board.
- I'II work when he's sIeeping.

464
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,192
Ten feet, ScofieId.

465
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,478
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

466
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,154
I thought you said
the margin for error was zero days.

467
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,231
I did.

468
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,155
Ah!

469
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,753
Nice out here.

470
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,752
I got a buddy who's got a pIace
way back up in these woods.

471
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,400
Come up here hunting
around this time of year.

472
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
Man.

473
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,475
(muffled yells)

474
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,676
Back in. Back in.

475
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,075
Here. Come here.

476
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,194
- Take her out there.
- She's nothing.

477
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,193
Nobody wouId beIieve her
if she taIked, anyway.

478
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,272
A hundred yards or so shouId do it.

479
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,391
Do it.

480
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,277
Go!

481
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,751
(muffled cries)

482
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,317
I'm sorry.

483
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,676
- You gotta beIieve me.
- (train whistles)

484
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,479
(Hale) Dammit!

485
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,788
(screams)

486
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,795
PIease!

487
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,317
PIease!

488
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,918
PIease.

489
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,637
Pick up the casings.

490
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,196
What's your probIem?

491
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,274
I got a neuroanatomic Iesion
affecting my reticuIar activating system.

492
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,078
What does that mean?

493
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,515
It means I don't sIeep.

494
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,111
At aII.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,834
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,311
- I was set up.
- Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,039
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a prison ceII.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,795
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- He kiIIed the vice president's brother.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,269
- Why you wanna see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,430
- I'm getting you out.
- That's impossibIe.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,078
Not if you designed the pIace.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,754
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,910
I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,673
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,954
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,476
- A Iawyer's poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,950
ScofieId, found you a new ceIIie.
Haywire, get in here.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,759
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,239
Where is Fibonacci?

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,629
I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,118
On your feet.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,350
What time is it?

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,635
- Get up.
- What's going on?

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,517
Let's go, LincoIn. On your feet.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,318
- BeIIick.
- Come on, move it.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,949
BeIIick. BeIIick. No! BeIIick!

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,031
BeIIick!

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,070
BeIIick! Where are you taking...
BeIIick! No!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,549
No! BeIIick, no! No! I got a month Ieft!

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,279
PIease, no, BeIIick!

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,432
BeIIick, no. BeIIick, pIease, no!

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,751
No, I got a month Ieft! PIease!

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,751
No, BeIIick...

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,311
PIease, BeIIick...

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,035
Make your peace, LincoIn.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,271
Let's get on with it.

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,351
(door slams)

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
(man) Open 40.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,191
CIose 40.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,549
Haywire, you ever thought of breaking out?

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,872
- What the heII wouId I do out there?
- Not be here.

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,750
HaIfway houses. Psych visits.
Meds. Checking in with the PO.

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,116
Urine tests. Keeping ajob.

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,795
No. Why'd you ask?

43
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,270
This guy was taIking about it in the yard.
I didn't know what to say.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,193
TeII Officer BeIIick.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,272
He'II make Iife easier for you if...

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,350
If what?

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,716
- Your tattoos.
- What about them?

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,836
What are they of? No, no, no,
what are they? Like, some kind of...

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,835
- They're just tattoos.
- (guard) Candy time, Haywire.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,749
They think I have schizo-affective disorder
with bipoIar tendencies.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,831
Think you got it?

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,433
Whatever.

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,110
I take the piIIs
to keep the quacks off my back.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,199
Bye, now.

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,953
Get outta the way.

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,713
You know, maybe they give you
those things for a reason.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,997
Yeah. To keep me duII.

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,834
To keep me
in their invisibIe freaking handcuffs.

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,309
SeriousIy. Those tattoos, they're beautifuI.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,233
You mind if I, you know,
Iook at the whoIe thing?

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,153
I do, actuaIIy.

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,514
Why?

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,716
(guard) Yo. Stand cIear.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,268
Does there need to be a reason?

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,912
Sucre.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,673
I'm not even taIking to you, man.

67
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,790
(Abruzzi) What's the probIem?

68
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,997
- Nothing I can't handIe.
- WeII, I knew there was a probIem.

69
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,516
I couId teII by Iooking at you
from across the yard.

70
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,831
Guys, didn't I say there was a probIem?

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,229
So what's the probIem?

72
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,199
- You're Iooking at it.
- What, Haywire?

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,352
Yup. He's my new ceII mate.

74
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,271
- That's a probIem.
- He doesn't sIeep.

75
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,954
- So when do you dig?
- I don't.

76
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,792
Hey, you and I are in bed now.

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,589
You made me a promise. You said
that we were gonna get out of here.

78
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,116
You renege now, and I'm gonna cut you.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,430
So you better take care of your business.

80
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,590
Or I wiII take care of you.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,830
Have a nice day.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,072
It's reaIIy coming together, isn't it?

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,515
- Yup.
- You think it'II be done in time?

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,197
WeII, I figure we stiII have the interior aIcoves
and piIasters to do, which is no smaII task.

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,477
But, yes. I think so.

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,274
Listen, I have to say I reaIIy appreciate
aII the effort that you put into this.

87
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,115
I wish there was some way I couId,
you know, pay you, or something.

88
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,873
There is one thing you couId do for me.

89
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,989
- My ceII mate.
- The inimitabIe CharIes Patoshik. Haywire.

90
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,197
- Then you know.
- HoId it right there.

91
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,956
Officer BeIIick is in charge of ceII transfers.
You're gonna have to taIk to him about that.

92
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,157
I tried. But he seems to think
we're a good match.

93
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,596
- Has he threatened you?
- Who? Haywire or BeIIick?

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,075
UnfortunateIy, unIess there's
some evidence of vioIence

95
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,674
or sexuaI predation between ceII mates,

96
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,639
those kinds of requests
faII on deaf ears around here.

97
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,918
Prison system's a IittIe too crowded
for requests based on personaIity.

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,950
- It's not exactIy SandaIs out there.
- (knock at door)

99
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,438
Warden, sorry. Your wife is here.

100
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,275
What? She's not supposed
to be here tiII four o'cIock.

101
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,432
Becky, do not Iet her come in here
under any circumstances.

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,640
She's not supposed to see this
untiI our anniversary. I'II be right out.

103
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,799
Hi, sweetheart. You're earIy.

104
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,153
- Let's go eat.
- You're acting funny.

105
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,118
- I am?
- What's going on in there?

106
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,479
- Just going over some fiIes.
- Becky said you were in a meeting.

107
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,472
This isn't ToIedo aII over again, is it?

108
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,836
ToIedo? How can you say that?

109
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,558
- Then you won't mind if I Iook.
- Uh, Judy...

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,589
Warden, I'm not gonna be abIe to cooperate.
I'd get kiIIed if I did.

111
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,317
Johnson's stiII deciding.

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,358
Then you and I are done.

113
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
You shouId have just toId me.

114
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,711
WeII, you know how anxious I get
when you come around the inmates.

115
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Becky, have a guard
escort Johnson back to his ceII.

116
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,715
I'II deaI with him Iater.
Come on, Iet's eat.

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,759
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your attorney.

118
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,070
I'm representing you now.

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,878
Hm.

120
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,918
If that's aII right with you.

121
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,039
- Last time I saw you, you caIIed me a Iiar.
- Things have changed.

122
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,559
I beIieve you now.

123
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,949
I got in touch with
Crab Simmons' ex-girIfriend, Leticia.

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,508
She corroborated your story.

125
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,279
- WiII she testify?
- She's missing.

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,954
I don't know.
I think the Secret Service got to her.

127
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,554
- Secret Service?
- They've been poking around.

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,313
They show up, she disappears.
What do you think?

129
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,072
Oh, man.

130
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,156
I didn't reaIise it was that high up, you know?
Do you know what we're up against?

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,279
I know it's a Iot more
than either of us can handIe on our own.

132
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,670
- Project Justice.
- Why have I heard of them?

133
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,672
They handIe death penaIty cases.
There's a guy, Ben Forsik.

134
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,036
I sent him copies of everything.
You couId teII him what you found.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
Maybe it'II be enough to bring him on board.

136
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,273
OK.

137
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,437
So, uh, how's Sebastian?

138
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,716
What do you mean?

139
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,237
WeII, you being here.
I mean, is he cooI with it?

140
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,676
I haven't taIked to him.

141
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,430
The, um...

142
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,954
The engagement's off.

143
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,393
Oh.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,710
Sorry.

145
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,076
You couId at Ieast say that Iike you mean it.

146
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,151
I do.

147
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,318
God, you aIways were a Iousy Iiar.

148
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,037
Yeah.

149
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,553
I better get to Project Justice.

150
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,269
Veronica.

151
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,869
Thank you. I didn't have a whoIe Iot Ieft.

152
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,520
You can thank me when I get you out of here.

153
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,431
(door buzzes)

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,198
Baby, it's me. Are you there?

155
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,838
HeIIo? Are you there?

156
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,391
Hey. If she is,
she obviousIy don't want to taIk to you.

157
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,273
It's Wednesday, babe.
You were gonna come around today, right?

158
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,750
Look, I gotta hang up now.
I gotta go back in the bIock, but...

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,673
you're gonna be here today, right?

160
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm your man, baby, and I Iove you.

161
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,391
I do.

162
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
It's a pattern.

163
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,830
- What did you say?
- Your tattoo. It's a pattern.

164
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,115
You're seeing things.

165
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,715
Putting him in with Haywire is a Iow bIow.

166
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,315
What? The shrinks cIeared Haywire
for re-entry into Gen Pop.

167
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,632
- He's so doped up on meds he's Iike a kitten.
- A kitten who murdered both his parents.

168
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,190
With respect, sir,
if you give ScofieId preferentiaI treatment,

169
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,794
it'II undermine your credibiIity.

170
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,111
I know you got a soft spot for the guy
because he's got brains

171
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,079
and he's heIping you with that contraption,
but the guy's a vioIent criminaI.

172
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,993
He deserves punishment
as much as the rest of these guys.

173
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,358
You know that I'm Iess interested
in punishment than I am in rehabiIitation.

174
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,716
And sticking him in with Haywire
is not rehabiIitation in my book.

175
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,553
You deIegated authority
over Gen Pop to me, boss.

176
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,076
- I know I did.
- You gotta Iet me do my job or pass it on.

177
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,355
Now, Brian, go easy.

178
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,753
There's a reason I'm giving you
more and more responsibiIity.

179
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,675
When I retire,
I'm recommending you to take my pIace.

180
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,876
Don't make me regret it.

181
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,590
AII I'm saying is, take another Iook at the
ScofieId situation. I trust yourjudgment.

182
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,352
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,189
HoId up. This is supposed to be
an open visitation. Why we doing it here?

184
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,271
Ask your visitor.

185
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,873
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

186
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,679
- She's not gonna be coming any more.
- Is she hurt?

187
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,719
No, no, she's fine, she's fine.
She's just, uh...

188
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,270
She's with me now.

189
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,318
She's with you now? It's ajoke, right?

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,949
No, she made a decision, man.
She decided she needed stabiIity.

191
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,070
- Is she gonna get that from you?
- You can think what you want about me but...

192
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,038
I'm not the one who's in prison.

193
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
I actuaIIy can do something for her.

194
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,153
She wanted me to taIk to you first
in case you got mad...

195
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,151
Hijo de tu madre, jte voy a matar!

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,196
As�� sea lo ultimo que hagas.

197
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,510
jDesgraciado! jTe voy a matar!

198
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,676
You just proved my point.

199
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,638
You're a con.

200
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,598
And that's aII you'II ever be.

201
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,231
Make it quick.

202
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
Yeah. He's right in here.

203
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,757
Take a waIk, Choppy.

204
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,350
ScofieId.
You're in a restricted area.

205
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,716
I'm doing yard work for PI.
We need some fertiIiser.

206
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,553
Then why are you in the masonry section?

207
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,155
Oh, by the way, how's the foot?

208
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,150
Don't ever go around me to the Pope again.

209
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,189
Now, move.

210
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,589
You know what, Haywire?

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,989
I don't think we're gonna work out.

212
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,116
And since I was here first,
I think you shouId go.

213
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,310
I crapped myseIf once in junior high.

214
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,715
During PE, we were pIaying badminton,

215
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,511
and I knew I had to waIk past a bunch of the
other students to get back to the Iocker room,

216
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,639
and so I just started waIking.

217
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,679
And I tried to make fun of it,
you know, before anyone eIse did.

218
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,274
So I turned around behind me,
and I said, ''Look, I have a taiI.''

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,388
I just shared a secret with you.

220
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,711
- Now it's your turn.
- You want to know what the tattoos mean?

221
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,791
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

222
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,832
(Abruzzi) Hey, fish.

223
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,593
Making any progress?

224
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,195
With SIeeping Beauty back there?
Or with the digging?

225
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,271
- Either.
- No.

226
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,433
- But I know what to do.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,799
ProbIem is,
you don't got the stugots to do it.

228
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,515
(guard) Abruzzi, Iet's go.

229
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,511
See ya.

230
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,796
Yeah? ReaIIy?
WeII, teII the crazy son of a bitch I said hi.

231
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,394
- Wrap it up.
- How's Aunt Ruth? She out of hospitaI?

232
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,835
- Wrap it up.
- HoId on, Ma.

233
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,911
Bite me.

234
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,996
OK. We got a probIem now, man.

235
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,071
Let's handIe it then.

236
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,671
That's what I thought.

237
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,232
(phone rings)

238
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,197
- HeIIo?
- Maricruz? It's me.

239
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,078
What's going on?
What's the deaI with you and Hector?

240
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,957
- When were you gonna teII me?
- What?

241
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,429
That Rita SaIda��a's been visiting you.

242
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,795
- What?
- Yeah. Hector told me.

243
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,032
Hector toId you. Of course he toId you.
Baby, that guy is a snake. He's a Iiar.

244
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,190
- Why wouId he Iie?
- Why would he lie?

245
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,637
Because he's been trying to get into your
pants since the minute we started dating.

246
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,871
You know what? I don't know what to beIieve.

247
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,155
Me, mami. BeIieve me.

248
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,038
Yeah, while l wait by the phone twice a week.

249
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,509
Baby, where is this coming from?

250
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,591
I don't know.

251
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,272
Look, there's just so many things.

252
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,717
Yesterday I went to Teresa's house,
and I saw her baby.

253
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,399
Is that what this is about?
Your cIock is ticking?

254
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,438
WeII, I am gonna be 30 in a few years.

255
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,830
You're 25. You want to get pregnant?
Let's get pregnant right now.

256
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,036
I can't get pregnant untiI I'm married.

257
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,430
We're gonna get married. In 16 months.

258
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,118
Yeah, weII, Hector says
that if something goes wrong in there,

259
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,634
you couId serve your fuII sentence.

260
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,117
I can't wait ten years.

261
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,029
l can't wait ten years, baby.

262
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,032
I'm gonna be out in 16 months.

263
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,997
Te lo prometo, mi amor.

264
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,116
But what if something does happen, huh?

265
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,589
Baby, I can't wait that Iong.

266
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,631
I can't.

267
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,511
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

268
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,869
HeIIo? Baby, wait... HeIIo?

269
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,116
Even if Leticia turned up,
her testimony wouId be worthIess.

270
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,352
By and Iarge, mostjunkies with
criminaI records don't shine on the stand.

271
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,874
I just found aII this out
in the past coupIe days.

272
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,158
I'm confident I can find out more
now that I'm devoting aII my time to the case.

273
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,074
The agent who came to visit when Leticia
was in your office, what did he want?

274
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,109
Nick, pIease. You've got to understand,
unIess there's new information for us,

275
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,237
we've aIready reviewed
Mr Burrows' case thoroughIy.

276
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,436
Do you have any new evidence?

277
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,397
- No, but I...
- But.

278
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,631
That is what you're teIIing us, right?
I need to cIarify here.

279
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,075
Yes. That is what I'm teIIing you.

280
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,472
But, Mr Forsik, you don't need to point out
what I don't have. I'm weII aware of that.

281
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,634
I'm asking for your heIp. I don't think a man
shouId be kiIIed for something he didn't do.

282
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,678
That's what it says
on your mission statement in the Iobby.

283
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,957
- We get many requests for representation.
- I'm sure you do...

284
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,999
And I have to decide which cases we're going
to devote our Iimited resources to.

285
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,355
I wiII do aII of the Iegwork, Mr Forsik,

286
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,829
but with no experience
in death penaIty cases,

287
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,072
I'm just asking you
to point me in the right direction.

288
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,119
PIease.

289
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,279
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,999
We just don't have the manpower.

291
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,591
Thank you for your time.

292
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,236
She's just Ieaving now.

293
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
It'II take her a haIf-hour
to get across town in this traffic.

294
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,595
We're not gonna need nearIy that much time.

295
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,318
I've turned up quite a bit aIready.

296
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,397
Hey. Hey, have you seen my toothpaste?

297
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,994
- It was right here.
- I haven't seen it.

298
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,358
- I aIways put it in the same pIace.
- I'm sure it'II turn up.

299
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,670
(guard) Lights out in ten minutes.

300
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,034
The tattoos - there's a maze.

301
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,918
- Get away from me.
- I need to see 'em.

302
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,230
You gotta show 'em to me.
It's puIIing me in.

303
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,915
I said, get away from me.

304
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,271
OK.

305
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,555
He's got a maze on his skin.

306
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,148
Man's got a maze on his skin.

307
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,358
Why? Why wouId he do that? Why?

308
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,075
Why wouId he put a maze on his skin?

309
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,912
Um...

310
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,991
I don't know.

311
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,309
- How are your contacts in chemicaI Iockup?
- Depends who's asking.

312
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,870
I need a bottIe of drain Iine root controI,
sooner than Iater.

313
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,475
You got weeds growing in your ceII?

314
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,076
Just one.

315
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,674
(man) Looking for me?

316
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,036
I wanted to ask some questions
about the LincoIn Burrows case.

317
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,951
- Yeah?
- I'm Veronica Donovan.

318
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm representing LincoIn on his appeaI.

319
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,349
What about it?

320
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,955
You were the first one to LincoIn's
apartment the night of the murder.

321
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,029
Right.

322
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,908
I'd reaIIy appreciate it if you couId
just teII me exactIy what you saw.

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,278
Dispatch caIIed. Burrows was seen running
from the garage where they found Steadman.

324
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,079
So we went over to Burrows' pIace.

325
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,233
We spread out, l took the bathroom. l saw
your client washing out the bloody pants.

326
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,197
PoIice! Hands up.

327
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,748
I don't need to teII you
it was Steadman's bIood.

328
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,630
In the report you typed up, you said
you saw LincoIn in the bathroom. That's aII.

329
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,395
Later, you testified that you saw him
washing the pants. Which one is it?

330
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,268
- Does it matter?
- Did you see him washing the pants or not?

331
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,673
Yes. He stood up, turned around,
his hands were aII wet, Iooking guiIty as heII.

332
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,151
Your testimony factored into his conviction.
You know that, right?

333
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,839
You know, Iady, if you got any other
questions, just go through the department.

334
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,270
Ms Donovan?

335
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,794
I didn't mean to scare you.

336
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,350
- What are you doing here?
- Nick Savrinn, with Project Justice.

337
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,273
I know who you are,
but what are you doing here?

338
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,037
Look, my boss may not think
LincoIn's case is worth Iooking into, but I do.

339
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,031
There's a quicker way
to take care of your probIem.

340
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,315
There's smarter ways, too.

341
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,356
(guard) Lights out in ten minutes.
Hey, Iights out in ten minutes.

342
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,189
What stood out was that most death penaIty
cases take ten years to exhaust aII appeaIs.

343
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,271
LincoIn got there in three.

344
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,148
So for it to be expedited, there had
to have been some poIiticaI infIuence?

345
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,028
Steadman was the vice-president's brother.
It's not hard to beIieve.

346
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,953
How? They got to every judge
that rejected his appeaI?

347
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,031
It doesn't take ajudge.

348
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,710
AII it takes is a IittIe speciaI attention
from one of his cIerks.

349
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,110
But how LincoIn got fast-tracked
doesn't interest me. It's why.

350
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,236
If he was set up, then why?

351
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,756
I think the answer to that
might Iie in the victim.

352
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,072
What do we know? He was a CEO of EcoFieId,
right? He was pushing aIternative energy.

353
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,277
Successfully pushing aIternative energy.

354
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,033
OiI companies, the Saudis,
even our government -

355
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,750
a Iot of peopIe stood to benefit
with Steadman out of the picture.

356
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,752
Why did you wait tiII now
to take up this case?

357
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,628
I thought he did it, Iike everybody eIse.

358
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,836
I just hope it's not too Iate.

359
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,310
It very weII may be.
You need to prepare yourseIf for that.

360
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,996
What about you?

361
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,071
Why death penaIty work?

362
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,431
My father did 15 years
for a crime he didn't commit.

363
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,116
I know that when the government gets you in
their cross hairs, you stand very IittIe chance.

364
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,519
That's why.

365
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,038
Now, do you want my heIp?

366
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,069
- I want in.
- Too Iate.

367
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,993
I'II do anything.
These hands are digging machines.

368
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,789
I'II get you to China.
I'II dig Iike a psychotic rodent if I have to.

369
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,711
Fish, I gotta be back in.

370
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,588
As of right now, there is no in.
Van Gogh over there is my new ceII mate.

371
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,830
But you're gonna get rid of him.

372
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,799
- I'II do what's necessary.
- You're my boy.

373
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,356
- So how you gonna do it?
- Let's just put it this way.

374
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,238
Someone's gonna get hurt.

375
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,551
(phone ringing)

376
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,039
(woman) How did we miss this?

377
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,671
ScofieId's father was out of the picture by the
time he was born. Took his mother's name.

378
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,673
AII right. ScofieId had no priors
and a fuII-time job as an engineer?

379
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,320
- (man) Correct.
- Then he goes and robs a bank,

380
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,630
discharging a gun in the process,

381
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,712
so in sentencing he couId
manoeuvre his way to Fox River,

382
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,031
where his brother's
scheduled to die in less than a month.

383
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,998
- Obviously, something's up.
- With aII due respect,

384
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,993
brothers are incarcerated together aII over.
It may just be a coincidence.

385
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,471
(woman) Move on the younger brother.

386
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,112
Do it pre-emptiveIy, before anything rises up,
bites any of us in the ass.

387
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,310
It's a pathway.

388
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,149
Where does it Iead?

389
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,952
Where are you taking me?

390
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,998
What? Are you nuts?

391
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,072
Officer! I need an officer!

392
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,231
What the heII's the probIem down here?

393
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,279
What the... Son of a bitch.
Open up on 40.

394
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,238
He's got the pathway on his body.
It Ieads somewhere.

395
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,390
- Back off, Haywire.
- Now, Iook.

396
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,516
Look at his tattoos. It's a pathway.

397
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,750
I said back off.
You want a hot shot?

398
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,637
I'm teIIing you, Iook... Argh!

399
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,631
Back off, man.

400
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,793
- Let's go. Get him out of here.
- It Ieads to heII! It Ieads to heII!

401
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,034
It's a pathway to heII!
He's taking us aII to heII!

402
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,151
(door slides opens)

403
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,797
So, the gang's aII back together again.

404
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
WeII, ain't that sweII?

405
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,875
I toId you
not to go around me with the Pope.

406
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,430
But you just keep making waves, don't you?

407
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,190
- Good to be back, man.
- Good to have you back.

408
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,597
So, when do we get started?

409
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,953
- Good afternoon, Mr ScofieId.
- HeIIo.

410
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,031
How are you feeIing today?

411
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,111
ReaI good.

412
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,350
What happened?

413
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,714
Uh...

414
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,792
Caught an eIbow pIaying basketbaII.

415
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,869
Uh-huh.

416
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,713
- Mind if I take a Iook?
- By aII means.

417
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,877
You know you're gonna get kiIIed
in here, right? If you're not carefuI.

418
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,110
I'II make you a bet.

419
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,955
When I get out of here, aIive,
I'II take you to dinner.

420
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,431
Lunch. Cup of coffee.

421
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,354
MichaeI, this charm act

422
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,149
couId be exactIy what's getting you
into troubIe out in the yard.

423
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,671
Lean forward.

424
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,636
AII right. You went to the parking garage,
Terence Steadman is aIready dead.

425
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,917
- That's right.
- You saw that, you ran? Took the gun?

426
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,718
- Dumped the gun.
- Where?

427
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,315
- Storm drain. Van Buren and WeIIs.
- Nobody ever found it.

428
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,593
What did you do after that?
Go back to your apartment?

429
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,556
Yeah.

430
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,196
l was freaking out,
trying to fgure out what had happened.

431
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,352
Then l saw the bloody pants in the tub.

432
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,232
The cops, they busted in
a minute after I got there.

433
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,709
The pants, with Steadman's bIood on them.

434
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,917
First cop on the scene says
he saw you washing them in the tub.

435
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,549
He's Iying. My hands were wet
after spIashing water on my face.

436
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,995
PoIice! Let's see the hands! Hands up!

437
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,714
I never touched those pants.

438
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,314
Which brings us back to the gun,
the one you dumped.

439
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,153
It was pIanted.
OnIy way it couId have got there.

440
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,189
- BaIIistics matched it to a sIug...
- The gun was pIanted. Just Iike the pants.

441
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,192
Your fingerprints were aII over the gun.

442
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,759
Bo.

443
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,514
- Who's Bo?
- He's the guy who arranged everything.

444
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,279
He had me come round the night before,
try a few guns, see which one felt right.

445
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,557
That was the setup. One of those
must have been the murder weapon.

446
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,236
That's how they got my fingerprints
on the gun. Had to be.

447
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,429
AII right. So this Bo, he coerces you
into doing this, aII to cIear a $90,000 debt?

448
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,995
He was gonna kiII my son.

449
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,073
- WeII?
- Lot of ''I didn't do it'', don't count for much.

450
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,072
The tape that shows LincoIn
puIIing the trigger. You got it?

451
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,152
- Yeah.
- If LincoIn's teIIing the truth, the tape's Iying.

452
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,677
I think we shouId have a Iook,
decide for ourseIves.

453
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,991
You're cIear.

454
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,358
If the chemicaIs can eat
through the iron pipes,

455
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,874
how come they can't eat
through the tube?

456
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,077
When the chemicaIs are combined,
they become a corrosive.

457
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,311
- You studied chemistry or something?
- Not in schooI.

458
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,839
But what you're doing up there
in the infirmary,

459
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,036
what's it gotta do with this here?

460
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,078
Getting through this waII
is just the beginning.

461
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,199
There's a whoIe Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside waIIs.

462
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,831
The infirmary's
the cIosest buiIding to those waIIs.

463
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,553
And the weakest Iink in the security chain.

464
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,631
CooI.

465
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,356
I think I've removed enough grout
to bust through.

466
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,512
I'm gonna need you to make some noise.

467
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,389
# Como una promesa, eres t��.
Como una ma��ana...

468
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,119
Is that the best you can do?

469
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,636
Have some faith, papi. Have some faith.

470
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,188
# Como una sonrisa, eres t��

471
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,078
- (man) Shut up!
- # Eres t��, as��...

472
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,073
- (angry shouts and commotion)
- # Eres t��

473
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,675
# Mi esperanza, eres t��, eres t��

474
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,880
- (klaxon)
- # As��, eres t��

475
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,112
# Eres t��

476
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:36,196
# Como el agua de mi fuente

477
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,193
(screaming) # Eres t��

478
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,594
# Eres t��

479
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,117
- # Eres...
- (klaxon)

480
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,636
Not one more word. Next inmate
that opens his mouth goes in the hoIe.

481
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,831
(whispers) We're good.

482
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,431
You OK?

483
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,350
Work.

484
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,829
- It's fine.
- (doorbell)

485
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,791
I got it.

486
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,393
- Everything aII right?
- CouIdn't be better.

487
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,994
You want to come in?
We just sat down to eat.

488
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,073
No. I just wanted to stop by
to teII you in person.

489
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,830
- ProbIem soIved.
- What's this?

490
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,632
That is a transfer request. MichaeI ScofieId
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

491
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,471
Have a good night.

(man) previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,309
I didn't kiII him.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,595
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,232
put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,959
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a ceII.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,669
- I'm Iooking for Burrows.
- (Sucre) Man kiIIed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,194
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,350
- I'm getting you out.
- ImpossibIe.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,953
Not if you designed the pIace.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,750
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,637
I've got 'em on me.

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,393
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,674
The evidence was cooked.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,515
- There's a Iawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,950
- I'm gonna kiII that scum.
- You kiII him, you kiII our ticket out of here.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,315
- Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me now.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,391
Fish, I gotta be back in.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,838
Nick, Project Justice. My boss may not think
LincoIn's case is worth Iooking into, but I do.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,273
When do we get started?

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,316
This waII is just the beginning.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,676
There's a Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,198
That is a transfer request. MichaeI ScofieId
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,959
- About your transfer request for ScofieId.
- More specificaIIy, why you denied it.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,636
Look, Mr KeIIerman, do I come to your house
and teII you where to put your furniture?

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,794
- We're just asking for professionaI courtesy.
- A federaI courtesy in a state penitentiary.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,156
Most peopIe wouId be happy
to have a body taken off their hands.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,596
These men are my responsibiIity.
From the minute they waIk in

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,275
to the time they've paid their debt to society,
I'm responsibIe.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,033
UnIess he's done something
I don't know about,

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,635
he is gonna stay here at Fox River
under my watch.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,508
Mr Pope, in our Iine of work,
just about everyone has done something

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,672
that someone doesn't know about.

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,593
- What's this?
- Right now, just a piece of history.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,593
Whether it becomes a current event,
now, that's up to you.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,638
My wife aIready knows about ToIedo.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,029
Does she reaIIy?

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,714
You're a smart man, Warden.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,713
I'm sure you can find a reason
ScofieId's presence is no Ionger required

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,473
at this particuIar correctionaI faciIity.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,633
I need some more PVC here, boss.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,556
- Boss?
- Sure thing, Burrows.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,235
I don't wanna check for spIinters.
I want every piece accounted for.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,436
Sure.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,353
I got a ripped fertiIizer bag inside.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,232
Hey, you!

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,436
You!

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,231
Get in there and cIean it up before this whoIe
pIace starts smeIIing Iike San Juan.

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,268
(mutters to himself)

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,957
OK, he's on his way. Do you mind teIIing me
what this is aII about?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,878
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,794
I don't think so, fish.
That was not our agreement.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,598
I'm not gonna work with this crazy rhino.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,150
- Keep pushing it, John.
- Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,276
What's your deaI, man?

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,511
Touch my brother again and I'II show you.

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,279
Brother? Your brother?

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,878
We've got a few minutes. Are we gonna spend
'em spitting on each other or taIk business?

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,111
The reason we're aII here today
is we have a decision to make.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,475
EngIish, Fitz, or Percy.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,759
If we're gonna puII this off,
we need to take one of them out.

61
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,354
And you want us to teII you which one?

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,557
I just want you to heIp me get to them.
I'II take it from there.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,870
- You're crazy.
- AII I need is five minutes.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,714
- You won't get five seconds.
- I thought you had everything worked out.

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,476
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.
It's gonna take more than digging a few hoIes.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,553
There are eyes, ears, dots that couIdn't be
connected from the outside.

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,758
- And EngIish, Fitz or Percy?
- One of those dots.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,519
And how exactIy
are you supposed to puII this off?

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,672
With a IittIe heIp from my friends.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,309
Sucre, hoId up. ScofieId, you've got company.

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,276
Why do I get the feeIing that there's more
to you than meets the eye, ScofieId?

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,828
Anything you wanna teII me?

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,318
Some other reason you're in here
besides hoIding up a bank?

74
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,914
- You're being transferred.
- What?

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,468
We're moving you over to StatesviIIe.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,832
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can. I'm the boss here.

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,037
This is my house.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,156
- Three weeks.
- What for?

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,279
LincoIn Burrows.
He's being executed in three weeks.

80
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,318
I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,789
He's my brother.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,073
When I knew I was being sent to prison,
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,197
- So you couId be near him.
- That's right.

84
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,478
Don't take that away from me.

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,755
Not untiI it's over.

86
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,238
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,517
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,035
I'II arrange for you to say goodbye.
You ship out tomorrow.

89
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,034
(faint organ music)

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,118
I'm going into the waIIs,
see if I can access the roof.

91
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,714
Were you gonna teII me about the transfer?

92
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,110
- I'm taking care of it.
- You're taking care of it?

93
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,475
Sounds to me Iike you're reaching.

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,393
Maybe. A IittIe.

95
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,596
A IittIe.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,949
I'd made my peace, then you give me the one
thing a man in my situation shouIdn't have.

97
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,555
- Hope. And now that's gonna be taken away.
- Don't do this, Linc.

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,269
I got three weeks.
What do you want me to do?

99
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,559
(boy) Come on, MichaeI.
What do you want me to do?

100
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,632
- Bring her back.
- You know I can't do that.

101
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,990
But, Iook, there's some stuff that I can do.

102
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,231
It's not gonna be the same,
but we're gonna figure it out.

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,995
And no matter what,
it's stiII gonna be me and you.

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,670
OK, but what if something happens to you?

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,074
You just have a IittIe faith.

106
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Just have a IittIe faith.

107
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,313
(Nick) If we beIieve LincoIn, this tape is a Iie.

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,631
- It has to be.
- But you saw it. It's aII there.

109
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,554
But maybe what we're Iooking for
is what's not there.

110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,919
- OK. Steadman. See, what's he Iooking at?
- A car? A pedestrian?

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,151
(Nick) His eye Iine is high.
He's Iooking into the camera.

112
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,310
He might as weII be saying ''cheese''.

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,397
- Now he just sits there.
- For 10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

114
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,517
- Waiting for someone.
- Right.

115
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,836
There. That's a nine miIIimetre.
ShouIdn't there be a kick?

116
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,754
- LincoIn's pretty strong.
- Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoiI?

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,355
Now, you shoot someone,
supposedIy for revenge.

118
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,638
Do you take the time to go in and hit
the gIove box? Or get the heII out of there?

119
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,157
Feds said he was trying
to make it Iook Iike a robbery.

120
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,869
Look. Look at LincoIn's angIe
as he Ieaves the frame.

121
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,279
Mm.

122
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,920
He waIks away from the car.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,313
Now, this guy, who convenientIy hides his
face from the camera, comes back in. Why?

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,236
To expIain the bIoody pants they'd aIready
pIanted in his apartment. Nick, this is great.

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,629
- Who shaII we go to?
- Nobody. Yet.

126
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,157
To the unbiased eye, we're backing a horse
that died in the gate. A Iot of conjecture.

127
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,993
We don't have anything.
We need some evidence.

128
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,355
Look, if LincoIn didn't fire this gun,

129
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,637
somebody with serious skiIIs
worked on this to prove he did.

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,188
Fine, but how do we prove that?

131
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,152
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

132
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,196
Yeah, I know a guy.

133
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,149
Thanks.

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,119
We need to have a powwow. There's been taIk
about you packing your bags.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,751
Don't beIieve everything you hear.
I'm not going anywhere.

136
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,079
I have a reaIIy hard time trusting you, fish.

137
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,197
The important thing
is that we stay on scheduIe.

138
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,590
- Yeah? EngIish, Fitz and Percy?
- EngIish, Fitz or Percy.

139
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,796
Wanna know which one we shouId take out?

140
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,714
With aII due respect, I don't need opinions.
I need answers.

141
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,679
The warden Ieaves at five tonight,
so by five after five we need that key.

142
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,638
And how is this key
gonna give you the answers?

143
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,553
I'II worry about that.
Worry about getting the key.

144
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,235
Hey. This key better be worth it.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,834
Understand?

146
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,078
Afternoon, Mr ScofieId.

147
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,993
I need to know
if there's a way to bIock a transfer.

148
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,073
- There's about 50 ways.
- AII right. I'II take the quickest.

149
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,073
You fiIe a motion for what they caII
an interIocutory injunction.

150
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,833
- How Iong does that take?
- How fast can you write?

151
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,913
A man can cIaim aImost anything
vioIates his constitutionaI rights.

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,437
EnvironmentaI issues, aIIergies,
reIigious requirements - take your pick.

153
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,035
- What if they don't buy it?
- They're required to hear your motion.

154
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,350
TiII they do, you can't be transferred.

155
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,877
HeII, they've been trying to move
my tired, grey behind for ten years.

156
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,396
God bIess the American IegaI system.

157
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,119
Why do you want to stay in here so badIy?

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,875
There's someone here
I can't bear to Ieave behind.

159
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,192
I guess that means
we've got something in common.

160
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,398
- The state's requiring a physicaI for Burrows.
- You heard the news?

161
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,516
- No, what?
- They're brothers.

162
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,512
- Who?
- Burrows and ScofieId.

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,749
MichaeI ScofieId?

164
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,879
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.
He didn't say anything about it?

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,154
No.

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,110
It must be hard to be so cIose to your brother
and not be abIe to do anything to heIp him.

167
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,109
- What's this?
- A IittIe bathroom reading.

168
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,035
- WestmoreIand again?
- ScofieId. He's bIocking his transfer.

169
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,399
Even if the motion is denied,
it's gonna take 30 days to process.

170
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,153
And that means...

171
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,278
AII right, I'm going in.
I'm gonna need your heIp.

172
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,079
In in? Now? I thought you were waiting tiII...

173
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,119
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting
up there so when the time comes...

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,919
In case you didn't notice, the Iights are aII on.

175
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,471
You've got a Iive studio audience, fish.
How are you gonna get around that?

176
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,028
Don't we have some Iaundry to do?

177
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,670
Just to be cIear,

178
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,990
I ain't touching your drawers.

179
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,793
(guard #1) Eyes straight ahead.

180
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,155
- Keep it moving.
- (guard #2) Eyes front.

181
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,028
- (guard #1) Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
- Him.

182
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,280
(guard #1) Get him up. Hit him.

183
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,111
(guard #2) Stay down.

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,358
Come on.

185
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,198
Come on.

186
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,749
Fish. I can't deaI with that.

187
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,117
Fish. Come on.

188
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,997
Yo, fish. Fish, you're taking too Iong, bro.

189
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,109
This ain't gonna fIy. The Ricans, we've got
geneticaIIy higher bIood pressure, you know?

190
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,509
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

191
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,670
You said he was moving in on your girI.

192
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,672
My other cousin,
but thanks for bringing that up.

193
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,754
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

194
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,274
- So what happens now?
- Now?

195
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,920
It's aII about timing.

196
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,791
(watch beeps)

197
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,830
- It's a top-doIIarjob. You know who did it?
- No. Do you?

198
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,798
PeopIe who do this kind of work
are ghosts, man.

199
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,519
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,
you know?

200
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,434
Can you see anything that proves
the tape might have been doctored?

201
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,795
The thing's cIean. No footprints.

202
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,236
UsuaIIy, you peeI the video back,
anything bogus comes off.

203
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,959
Now you see it, now you don't.
But not this one.

204
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,271
It's Iaced. Ingrained.

205
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,114
Whoa, whoa.

206
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,590
- You see something?
- The probIem with eyes is they pIay tricks.

207
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,797
But your ears - ears don't Iie.

208
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,030
Here's the audio track from the tape.

209
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,832
- Sounds pretty true?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,708
But noise is aIive.
See, it doesn'tjust die Iike that.

211
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,439
Stripped down,
those IeveIs shouId be dancing.

212
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,877
A room that size wouId give you
a bIam, bIam, bIam, bIam, you know.

213
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,428
Off each waII, a spIit second after the other.

214
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,876
On yours,
the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

215
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,157
- What does that mean?
- The sound of a gunshot.

216
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,038
It wasn't recorded in that room.

217
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,590
- WouId you testify to that?
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

218
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,752
The tape's a dupe.
For aII I know, you guys tampered with it.

219
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,029
Look, if you want me to testify in court, I'm
gonna need to get my hands on the originaI.

220
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,469
- (pope) How are those aIIergies?
- Excuse me?

221
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,872
- (pope) In your motion, you cited chronic...
- Sinusitis.

222
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,635
It's not an aIIergy, actuaIIy.
It's a bacteriaI infection.

223
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,350
The moist air from the river aIong
the east waII heIps keep me, you know...

224
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,158
cIear.

225
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,119
I'm impressed. Not even a week here
and you're working it Iike an oId con.

226
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,749
You've got one up on me.
You know why I needed to fiIe those motions,

227
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,071
but I have no idea
why you needed to transfer me.

228
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,835
Traffic controI, ScofieId.
That's aII. Traffic controI.

229
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,514
It's coming up on five o'cIock. CaII it a day.

230
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,795
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

231
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,917
If I Iet go of this support,
the whoIe thing's coming down.

232
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,560
See, the Taj was designed using axiaI force -

233
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,269
a series of internaI forces
aIong the IongitudinaI axis.

234
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,672
- Yeah. How much Ionger?
- Depends on how Iong it takes to dry.

235
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,309
If you need me to Ieave,
I can show your secretary how to hoId it.

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,755
You can stay. There'II be a guard outside.

237
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,515
Just check in with Becky
and she'II have somebody escort you back.

238
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,512
- AII right.
- And, ScofieId.

239
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,592
I wanna thank you for showing up today.
I wouId've understood it if you didn't.

240
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,989
- We had a deaI.
- Right.

241
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,231
StiII, thanks. My wife is gonna Iove it.

242
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,470
You're weIcome.

243
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,519
- (man) See you tomorrow, sir.
- (woman) Good night, Warden.

244
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,670
(door closes)

245
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,389
We'd just happen to be two peopIe
who happen to know each other,

246
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,996
who happen to show up at the same movie
theatre at what happens to be the same time.

247
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,594
(woman laughs)

248
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,511
You know, from this angIe, you Iook
just as good as you did when we first met.

249
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,876
- How about from this one?
- Even better.

250
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,037
- Oh.
- Uh-uh. Those are for your guests.

251
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,111
- Guests?
- Your associates.

252
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,875
They said you had a meeting.
They're in the den.

253
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,470
Evening, Warden.

254
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,874
There's nothing I can do. I'm obIigated to fiIe
every motion so a hearing can be scheduIed.

255
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,273
- And how Iong does that take?
- A month, maybe two. It's out of my hands.

256
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,715
Why do I feeI you're not disappointed?

257
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,076
May I ask you a question, Warden?

258
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,310
More of an observation, reaIIy.

259
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,554
I was Iooking at the morgue photos
from that boy back in ToIedo - WiII CIayton -

260
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,191
and, my Lord,
if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

261
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,829
The appIe feII reaI far from the tree
with that one, didn't it?

262
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,595
It feII off the tree, feII aII over the pavement.

263
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,750
You son of a bitch.

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,513
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

265
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,319
but that's aII the forgiveness she's got Ieft.

266
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,358
EspeciaIIy when it comes to
an iIIegitimate chiId.

267
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,954
What happened with young WiII, Warden?

268
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,479
- Get out of my house.
- Lose ScofieId's paperwork.

269
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,915
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

270
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,434
Judy, it was a reaI pIeasure.

271
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,150
Thank you. And thatjust may have been
the best iced tea I've ever had.

272
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,710
Warden, better do everything you can
to hoId on to this one.

273
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
- I wiII.
- Good.

274
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,199
- Is everything aII right?
- Oh, yeah. Just fine. I, uh...

275
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,592
I just have a IittIe unfinished work
to take care of. I'II be right in.

276
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,477
OK.

277
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,835
He's aII cIear.

278
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,878
- Evening, LincoIn.
- Doctor.

279
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,157
I'm supposed to give you
a physicaI this evening.

280
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,119
Let me apoIogise for the dose of irony
we're about to participate in.

281
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,873
It's aII right. Just doing yourjob.

282
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,234
Yeah, weII...

283
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,997
Letting them know you're heaIthy enough to
execute is not why I went to medicaI schooI.

284
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,594
- I apoIogise.
- It's OK.

285
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,508
AII right.

286
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,512
I'm gonna need
a famiIy medicaI history from you.

287
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,628
Any aiIments or conditions
that are hereditary. Let's start with your mom.

288
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,996
- Cancer. Liver.
- OK. Father?

289
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,355
SpIit when I was young.

290
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,510
SibIings.

291
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,194
Anyone besides MichaeI?

292
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,596
Fox River's a smaII town, LincoIn.

293
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,231
PeopIe around here don't have
a whoIe Iot to do besides time and taIk.

294
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,071
Are you cIose?

295
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,198
(Linc) We were.

296
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,796
- (Sara) How about now?
- Huh?

297
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,189
How about now?

298
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,233
(Linc) He's been abandoned his whole life.

299
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,869
Dad, Mom - she died young -

300
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,554
and now me.

301
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,511
Think that's why he's here?

302
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,434
Cos your death wouId feeI Iike
it's happening again

303
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,069
(Linc) l abandoned him a long time ago.
That's why he's here.

304
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,636
- (watch beeps)
- (buzzer)

305
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,790
(guard) Gates cIosing.

306
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,072
- It's time.
- Time?

307
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,914
Oh, God. Here we go again.
Count's in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

308
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,437
- Trust me. The Iess you know, the better.
- The Iess I know? You got me in the dark.

309
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,988
That's exactIy where you wanna be.

310
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,757
(man) Don't normaIIy find you here
at this hour.

311
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,353
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

312
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,718
I reaIIy don't know any more, Ben.

313
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,430
AII I know is my son WiII
was my responsibiIity.

314
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,310
- If I'd stayed in his Iife, I couId've saved it.
- His death was an accident, Henry.

315
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,351
He was a criminaI,

316
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,797
and an addict, but he was onIy 18 years oId.

317
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,476
His mother made it cIear you couIdn't be
in his Iife if you weren't gonna be in hers.

318
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,109
When you chose to stay with Judy,
you understood that.

319
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,998
I not onIy understood it, I was gratefuI for it.

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,152
I toId myseIf I was respecting her wishes.

321
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,671
I cursed her under my breath
whiIe every day I thanked God

322
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,672
for aIIowing me to wash my hands of her.

323
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,830
Of ToIedo.

324
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,835
AII of it.

325
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,800
So I ran home,

326
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,394
to Judy,

327
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,948
and I buried the secret.

328
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,950
But I never got a chance to...

329
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,350
to bury my... my son.

330
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,997
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

331
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,518
Sacrifices somebody eIse's Iife
just to make their own Iife easier.

332
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,238
You can argue with me aII night. BeIieve me,
I haven't got anything better to do.

333
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,553
But it won't change the fact that I can't
just hand out originaI copies of evidence.

334
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,191
- If you couId just take a Iook...
- I don't care. I can't give it to you.

335
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,159
What if we brought somebody here?
Your supervisor couId monitor them.

336
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,232
He'd strip down and swear
on a stack of BibIes. Whatever.

337
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,278
Wait. What did you say
the docket number was?

338
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,194
It's 296 SPE.

339
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,352
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

340
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,995
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,
fIooded the pIace.

341
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,393
FiIes from over 100 cases -
pretty much Iost aII of them, incIuding yours.

342
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,756
- Just this room?
- Some kind of freak accident.

343
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,431
(buzzer)

344
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,559
(whistle)

345
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,950
- (guard) Count 'em.
- (Bellick) CaIIahan, Knight.

346
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,196
MaIinowski, PohIen.

347
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,669
(watch beeps)

348
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,993
Chance, Graziano.

349
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,719
ScofieId, Sucre.

350
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,349
ScofieId, get the heII out here.

351
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,116
We got a runner.

352
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,556
(alarm)

353
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,514
(pA) Lockdown.

354
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,955
Lockdown!

355
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,553
(inmates shout)

356
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,833
AII right. For the Iast time, pi��ata.

357
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,959
Where the heII's ScofieId?
He's gone, you're gone. You hear me?

358
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,998
(radio) Call it off, Captain.
l got Scofeld right here.

359
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,550
- Where?
- (radio) ln the warden's office.

360
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,790
Are you Iooking at him?

361
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,749
Stop trying to nail the secretary
and check the damn office.

362
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,919
Captain, he's gone.

363
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,071
(alarm continues and dogs bark)

364
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,835
- The man can'tjust vanish.
- I know, sir.

365
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,276
- He never checked out? The rear door?
- StiII Iocked. I checked.

366
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,635
How the heII did he...?

367
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,518
- What's going on?
- You're in the warden's office.

368
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,149
I couId kiII you and the paperwork
wouIdn't need more than a date.

369
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,791
- TeII me, what were you doing in here?
- AII right, Deputy. That's enough.

370
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,990
The work wasn't dry.
You said to stay untiI it was.

371
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,911
- You were in here?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,117
- It's true. I never saw him Ieave.
- I must not have seen him.

373
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,352
This is ridicuIous. This prisoner
was out of his ceII. He missed the count.

374
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,590
(pope) I understand, Deputy.

375
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,070
The thing is,
Mr ScofieId is not our probIem any more.

376
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,516
There was an error in his paperwork.
He's gonna be transferred.

377
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,716
That's not possibIe.

378
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,314
Escort the prisoner back to his ceII.

379
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,913
Warden, aII I need is three weeks.

380
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,353
- Get off me!
- Come on!

381
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,318
Henry, pIease. I just need a IittIe time.

382
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,789
Just give me the time.

383
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,918
Any chance you want to write this off
as a coincidence?

384
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,319
Me neither.

385
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,109
How couId they know we were coming?
Three hours ago, we didn't know.

386
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,909
- We're pissing someone off.
- You say that Iike it's a good thing.

387
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,869
PeopIe start breaking the Iaw,
you know you're getting warm.

388
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,515
We stiII have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

389
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,349
- Nick.
- Stay here.

390
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,956
Whoever it was has gone.
Does it Iook Iike they got anything?

391
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,315
No.

392
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,628
Everything's exactIy the way I Ieft it.

393
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,828
What? What?

394
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,668
- What?
- The tape. It's gone.

395
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,398
- Are you sure?
- How?

396
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,835
- Think this through.
- How couId they know?

397
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,070
- Wait. Does anyone eIse have a key?
- No.

398
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,994
- Are you sure this is where you put it?
- You were here. I was taIking to you.

399
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,868
I waIked toward the cabinet, and I said...

400
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,991
What?

401
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,275
Veronica, are you OK?

402
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,471
Veronica.

403
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,400
- (buzzer)
- (Bellick) Open up!

404
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,268
Breakfast, gentIemen. Let's move it.

405
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,559
Sucre, Iet's go. ScofieId, wait here.
I'm sure your ride'II be aIong any minute now.

406
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,754
This can't be it.

407
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,910
It can't end Iike this.

408
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,150
(Bellick) Let's move it.

409
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,073
- (Michael) Fitz.
- What?

410
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,310
We were gonna take Fitz out.

411
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,880
It was as cIear as day.

412
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,912
And the cops? How Iong did it take them
to respond? You got aII the timing down?

413
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,274
Think we wouId've made it?

414
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,236
Sucre, now.

415
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,958

00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,311
# Well, l had a dream

417
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:23,515
# Yes, l had a dream
l stood beneath an orange sky

418
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,594
Hey, fish face, where are you going?

# With my brother standing by

# l said, brother, you know, you know

# lt's a long road we've been walking on

424
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,714
Sorry.

# You know it is, you know it is

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,436
# Such a long road we've been walking on

427
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,678
Don't forget to buckIe up.

428
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,712
- (pope) What's he doing out of his ceII?
- (guard) He's being transferred.

429
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,475
No, there must be some mistake.
This man fiIed a motion yesterday.

430
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,870
He has a medicaI condition
which precIudes transfer.

431
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,996
Sinusitis, right?

432
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,435
Sinusitis.

433
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,992
Take the prisoner back to his ceII. But yank
his rec time. He missed count Iast night.

434
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,873
Hey.

435
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,838
You're home earIy. Everything OK?

436
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,798
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

437
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,110
There's just...

438
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,831
Judy,

439
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,118
there's someone I need to teII you about.

440
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,833
- (phone rings)
- (woman) Yes?

441
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,629
- (Kellerman) The transfer did not go through.
- (woman) Disappointing.

442
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,554
- (Kellerman) We can refle, but...
- (woman) It's a waste of time.

443
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,757
I think it's time we stopped
beating around the bush,

444
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,308
and go after the damn bush.

445
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,954
(Kellerman) Burrows.
What do you want done?

446
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,237
(woman) Take the only thing
Burrows has left- time.

447
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,030
After all, the chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,714
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,711
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,192
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,919
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,629
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the vice president's brother.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,154
- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,310
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossibIe.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,756
- Not if you designed the pIace.
- You've seen the bIueprints.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,116
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,829
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Ms Donovan? I didn't mean to scare you.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,831
- It's gone.
- Does anyone eIse have a key to this pIace?

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,038
You were here.
I waIked over to the cabinet and I...

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,554
Got an issue with our IittIe friend over there?

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,952
Yeah. Maybe it's time
I Iit up that Ieather once and for aII, huh?

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,914
- What happened?
- Don't make me Iie to you.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,389
- You heard the news?
- No. What?

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,152
- They're brothers.
- Who?

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,231
Burrows and ScofieId.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,309
MichaeI ScofieId?

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,392
I'm going into the waIIs,
see if I can access the roof.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,516
Take the onIy thing Burrows has Ieft.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,956
The chair isn't the onIy way
to take a man's Iife in prison.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,637
Just a few more rides.
Then you have to wrap it up.

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,037
Wow. Adam's getting bigger. Ten.

- I've been out of the Iife for years.
- I know.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,314
ProbIem is, no one's gonna beIieve that
if I take the heroin in my pocket

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,632
and put it in the gIove box of the reasonabIy
priced minivan you got over there.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,919
I wiII cuff you. I wiII drag you

- What did you teII him?
- What you said to say- you were in a meeting.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,634
If he comes by tomorrow,
teII him I'm not there.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,395
- OK. Goodnight, Veronica.
- Thanks, Wendy.

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,391
(guard) Bed check.

44
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,156
Why haven't you returned any of my caIIs?

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,917
Look, I appreciate everything you've done,
but I don't want your heIp any more.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,198
Don't want my heIp. Do you reaIIy think I had
something to do with that missing tape?

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,477
No. I'm just gonna go grab
a cup of coffee and get back to work.

48
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,552
I don't have time for this right now.

49
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,391
Veronica, just wait a second.
WiII you hoId on a second?

50
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,153
- Listen, what are you avoid...
- Don't touch me!

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,470
Everything OK, Miss Donovan?

52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,950
Lucasz, do you mind
waIking me back inside?

53
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,710
Take a waIk, paI.

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,995
You're being paranoid.

55
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,637
- You're being paranoid.
- Go away, Nick.

56
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,393
Show some skin, ScofieId.

57
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Hey, ScofieId!

58
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,075
I'm trying to sIeep, boss.

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,432
- I can't get through the waII.
- What do you mean you can't get through?

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,672
I know how to do it.
I just don't have the time to do it.

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,399
We're Iocked up. AII we got is time.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,678
You don't understand.
I pIanned this break on a scheduIe.

63
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,038
ConstantIy coming up here for count won't
Iet me do what I need to do to get through.

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,114
If I'm not back on scheduIe, which means
we're through by the end of the day ma��ana,

65
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,316
we're not getting out of here.

66
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,712
There's three things for certain in Iife -
death, taxes and count.

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,951
The onIy way to stop count is...

68
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,191
- What?
- Never mind. It's a bad idea.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,636
Worse than the idea of Iosing Maricruz?

70
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,230
A Iockdown. We get Gen Pop Iocked down
for a day, you'II have aII the time you need.

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,949
- And no count?
- BuIIs don't even come by.

72
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,076
OnIy one probIem.

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,151
How do we get a Iockdown?

74
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,273
- Can you get to the prison AC unit?
- Maybe.

75
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,159
You want a Iockdown?
You'd better get the inmates riIed up.

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,232
And if you wanna piss off
the meat in concrete,

77
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,595
turn up the heat.

78
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,518
(rap music)

79
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,632
- I thought you were retired.
- (man) Never mind me.

80
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,757
Heavy hitters want this done,
so that means I want it done.

81
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,398
No screw-ups.

82
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,759
For you, Diamond, it's not a probIem.
Burrows is as good as dead.

83
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,272
- Hottest ApriI on record.
- GIobaI warming.

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,113
ProbabIy. You got a minute?

85
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,316
About five years' worth.

86
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,391
Sorry. Right.

87
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,672
- You never toId me Burrows is your brother.
- Never came up.

88
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,118
Right. I'm curious if that
isn't because of my father, the governor.

89
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,150
He may not be the one puIIing the switch, but
he has power to grant cIemency and he won't.

90
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,595
And he never does.

91
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,719
My oId man was an abusive drunk
who abandoned his famiIy.

92
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,439
I don'tjudge anyone by their father's actions,

93
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,511
or inactions,

94
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,636
if that was your concern.

95
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,636
Just so you know,
I don't agree with his poIitics.

96
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,196
And I'm sorry about your brother.

97
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,714
I appreciate that.

98
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,356
Hey, this isn't much...

99
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,231
Um...

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,153
I have to give LincoIn a weekIy checkup.
If you want, I couId scheduIe the visits

101
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,152
to end right before
you come in for your shots.

102
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,917
That way you couId at Ieast see each other,
even if it's just in passing.

103
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,350
Thank you.

104
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,312
Yeah.

105
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,109
Greetings from the kitchen, fish. 100 bucks.

106
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,158
Theodore BagweII,
a transfer back from the infirmary.

107
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,231
(guard) Check. Open 14.

108
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,790
We got you a IittIe ''get weII'' gift.

109
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,789
It's just the right size.

110
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,196
Thank you, boys.

111
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,874
I'II catch up with you Iater.

112
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,074
What's your name?

113
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,469
Seth.

114
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,994
Are you new, Seth?

115
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,674
Scared? Look at me, boy.

116
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,757
You probabIy heard stories about me.

117
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,391
They're not aII true.

118
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,277
What do you say we go for a waIk, huh?

119
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,071
(AC units shut down)

120
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,399
- Your co-counseI's aIready here.
- Excuse me?

121
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,598
- What the heII are you doing here?
- TaIking to my cIient.

122
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,229
Don't taIk to him.
We don't know anything about this guy.

123
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,630
He found somebody that couId heIp us out.

124
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,438
You have one minute.

125
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,150
I've been going over the incident report.
Somebody made an anonymous caII

126
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,119
cIaiming to see LincoIn running away
from the garage with bIoody pants.

127
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,510
You can't cross-examine a witness
if you don't know who it is.

128
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,115
- We don't need to. We know where he is.
- What do you mean?

129
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,751
A PI friend of mine was abIe to backtrack
the phone caII to the poIice department.

130
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,276
Whoever made that caII
couIdn't have seen LincoIn that night.

131
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,476
How do you know?

132
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,553
Because the phone caII
came from Washington DC.

133
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,429
You were supposed to turn off the AC,
not turn on the furnace.

134
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,117
- It's getting so hot in here.
- Did I say you couId taIk, Cherry?

135
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,510
You'II know when
I want you to open your mouth.

136
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,751
Geary!

137
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,239
- Do something about the heat.
- Doing the best we can.

138
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,675
Your best is garbage.
It's 100 degrees in here.

139
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,752
- Look Iike I got frostbite to you?
- (buzzer)

140
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,831
Line it up!

141
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,638
Why don't you transfer us aII
somepIace cooIer, Iike Africa?

142
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,915
(murmurs of approval)

143
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,195
Get your ass on the Iine, convict.

144
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,196
We'II move when
the temperature situation is rectified.

145
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,550
BeIIick, this is Mack in ceII bIock.
We got some cons popping off.

146
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,029
Smack 'em, throw 'em on the Iine
and write 'em up.

147
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,636
If you can't handIe it,
don't cash your paycheck this week.

148
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,676
This is not a good time, Doc.

149
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,990
I got a caII a prisoner has heat exhaustion.

150
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,719
- He's faking it.
- Is that your medicaI opinion?

151
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,156
We got a bunch of overheated cons
getting Ioud in A-Wing.

152
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,992
I don't bIame 'em. It's an oven.

153
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,550
Everything's under controI.
You shouId go back to the infirmary.

154
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,633
When things caIm down, I'II have
your patients transferred from Sick Bay.

155
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,759
- Just Iooking out for your best interests.
- And I appreciate that.

156
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,753
But Officer BeIIick, we both know
it's iIIegaI to deny a prisoner medicaI care

157
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,836
and you couId Iose yourjob over it.
I'm just Iooking out for your best interests.

158
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,151
Go right on in.

159
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,953
Thank you, sir.

160
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,952
Don't be a baby, T-Bag. It ain't that hot.

161
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,159
Not that hot?!

162
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,596
When this guy woke up this morning,
he was white!

163
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,512
You wanna cooI off?

164
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,073
Step back.

165
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,956
We'II step back
when we get some wind bIowing in here.

166
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,197
AII right! That's it! Lockdown!
Everyone back to your ceIIs!

167
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,875
I said everyone back to your ceIIs.
Now, convicts!

168
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,272
- Lockdown!
- (buzzer)

169
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,113
- You got your Iockdown. Do your thing.
- You're coming.

170
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,351
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm the Iookout man, that's it.

171
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,638
I need you down there. It's a two-man job.
Let's hang a sheet.

172
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,235
You onIy hang a sheet when you
and your ceIImate wanna get friendIy.

173
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,678
You wanna protect your prison rep?
Or you wanna get out of here?

174
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,071
(angry shouting)

175
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,231
- What the heII's going on in here?
- They got beIIigerent and refused to rack in.

176
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,959
You Iocked it down
with inmates out of their ceIIs?

177
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,068
Figured we couId handIe
20 out-of-controI inmates easier than 300.

178
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,917
Listen up, bros. BeIIick.

179
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,436
I got one for you.
What do you caII a piece of white trash

180
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,115
who couIdn't pass the cops exam
and now makes Iess than a maiIman?

181
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,509
A CO.

182
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,270
- Get your hands off the fence.
- Suck it, pig!

183
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,274
You reaIIy Iet me down.
And that's hard to do,

184
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,480
because I don't expect much
from the inbred chiId of a retard.

185
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,199
That's right, Teddy.

186
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,271
I read your psych records.

187
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,148
About how your daddy
raped his mongoIoid sister

188
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,950
and then nine months Iater
IittIe Teddy pops out.

189
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,114
I'm gonna kiII you!

190
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,872
Hot as heII.

191
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,714
They'II wear themseIves out eventuaIIy.

192
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,673
The caII was a fake.
What about a stay of execution?

193
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,039
- It's IegaIIy insufficient.
- What the heII does that mean?

194
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,238
It means the prosecution couId point out
the evidence from your criminaI triaI.

195
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,914
The bIood, the video, the gun.

196
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,471
A questionabIe phone caII
is not gonna stack up to that.

197
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,916
- It's something, right?
- AbsoIuteIy. We got an area code.

198
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,471
My contact wiII track it to somepIace more
specific - a buiIding, neighbourhood, a bIock -

199
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,597
- to the person who made this caII.
- OK. What happens next?

200
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,240
We need to catch the next fIight to DC.

201
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,471
That is, of course, if you trust me now.

202
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,357
(T-Bag) It's coming.

203
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,432
It's coming! It's coming!

204
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,593
Get on the train! Whoo!

205
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,435
Get on the train! Get on the train!

206
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,070
Let's get to my office.

207
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,835
Oh, just what I thought.
PigIets are scared of the big bad woIf.

208
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,672
Big bad woIf!

209
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,828
Oh, just what I thought.

210
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,160
Get on the train!

211
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,591
(riot continues above)

212
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,351
Come on.

213
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,078
MariIyn, no!

214
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,230
Whose keys are those?

215
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,595
I guess in the commotion...

216
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,516
How many rounds you think you're going to
get off before they get their hands on you?

217
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,196
This is BeIIick. Our wing has been breached.

218
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,150
I want A-Wing evacuated and shut down.
AII access to B-Wing cut off now.

219
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,672
I'm gonna get some fIuids into you,
you'II be good as new.

220
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,479
Nod your head if you beIieve me.

221
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,551
Good man.

222
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,193
Theo.

223
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,589
What can we do for you today?

224
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,633
- Hmm. This where it hurts?
- A IittIe higher and to the Ieft.

225
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,950
You're three weeks post-op.

226
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,989
Your knee's heId together by a rod and three
screws. Tenderness is normaI. No more meds.

227
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,390
OK. Kwame, why are you back?

228
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,758
(guard over radio) lnmates have compromised
lockdown and breached A-Wing.

229
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,796
A-Wing is shutting down.

230
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,678
It's popping off up in G Pop!

231
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,909
(cheering)

232
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,996
Somewhere on the other side of this waII is
a drainage pipe to the prison's sewer system.

233
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,117
If we can get through this waII,
we can get into the pipe.

234
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,557
If we can get into the pipe,
we can get into the infirmary.

235
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,156
If we can get to the infirmary,
then we can get out of here.

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,878
Sorry, aII visitors have to Ieave.
You have to Ieave.

237
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,158
A minor disturbance in ceII bIock. A-Wing
is being shut down for safety purposes.

238
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,038
(Lincoln) A-Wing?
Veronica, MichaeI's in there.

239
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,270
- WiII he be OK?
- You have to Ieave now.

240
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,875
Go to DC. It's aII we've got.
I'II take care of MichaeI. AII right?

241
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,951
PIease.

242
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,918
- Sorry about cutting you short.
- I toId you not to apoIogise.

243
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,515
- It makes you Iook weak. What's going on?
- It's a minor disturbance.

244
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,991
Minor disturbance? My brother is in Gen Pop.
Give it to me straight.

245
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,311
Some cIowns breached ceII bIock.
But they won't get anywhere.

246
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,871
They aIways have Iocked doors at either end.
There's nothing to worry about.

247
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,951
(Lincoln) Son of a bitch.

248
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,429
(pA) Additional sectors of A-Wing
have been compromised.

249
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,391
(roaring shouts)

250
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,709
I'II be damned!

251
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,716
A rookie CO - and it ain't even Christmas!

252
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,950
Take the cuffs off. Give me the key.

253
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,395
Get out of here, T-Bag.

254
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,199
Oh, I see. You found him first.
Finders keepers.

255
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,350
You know, I respect that. I do.

256
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,230
- But I think we can work something out.
- What you got?

257
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,598
Oh, I can make your Iast few weeks
on Earth quite, quite enjoyabIe.

258
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,148
Get you some DemeroI, some X.

259
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,550
Make you forget about that big bad chair.

260
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,676
No deaI.

261
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,752
You gotta Iearn the art of negotiating.

262
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,071
Lesson one - bargaining position.

263
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,836
- RuIes just changed.
- Get the pig!

264
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,469
What are you doing?
You're not gonna make it.

265
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,075
ChiII, Sink. No bIood needs to spiII, Sink.

266
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,071
Then waIk away.

267
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,276
We both know that ain't gonna happen.

268
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,157
Yeah?

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,589
That's one big piIe of concrete.

270
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,752
How do you know where the pipe is?

271
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,071
- We've got someone to show us where it is.
- Oh, reaIIy? Who?

272
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,076
The infection's not bad.
I'II give you peniciIIin just to make sure.

273
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,151
Thanks, Doc.

274
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,395
This is Rizzo.
Does A-Wing need backup? Over.

275
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,510
(man) Negative. A-Wing is evacuating
and locked down. Remain in B-Wing.

276
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,513
What's up, Doc?

277
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,112
(door handle rattling, frustrated grunt)

278
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,998
Come on, Doc.

279
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,511
You don't wanna do this.

280
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,116
We're sorry. This Iine
is experiencing technicaI difficuIties.

281
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,992
You ever see one of them safari shows where
a bunch of cheetahs jump up on an anteIope?

282
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,673
Guess which one you are. (cackles)

283
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,113
Tough IittIe girI, ain't he?

284
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,789
I beIieve the deviI's got some crazy power,

285
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,156
but I don't think shining him on this waII
is gonna bring it down.

286
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,917
- Not unIess he's got a sIedgehammer.
- We don't need a sIedgehammer.

287
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,757
What the heII am I supposed to do with this?

288
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,872
(guard over radio) Sick Bay, report.
Sick Bay, please report.

289
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,157
Sick Bay, come in. ls everything OK?

290
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,350
You know what to say.

291
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,517
AII cIear in Sick Bay. Over.

292
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,591
Roger that.

293
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,757
Let them worry about the noise.
You worry about how to driII

294
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,150
through a concrete waII
with what used to be an egg beater.

295
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,915
- We just need a few smaII hoIes.
- How can we fit through smaII hoIes?

296
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,672
Ever hear of tensiIe strength?

297
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,832
- Hooke's Law of eIasticity?
- What do you think?

298
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,994
If we driII hoIes in strategic Iocations, we
compromise the waII's Ioad-carrying capacity.

299
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,517
- How about speaking EngIish?
- We'II be abIe to break through the waII.

300
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,636
Give me that.

301
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,838
We go in through the tip of each horn,
the eyes, the end of the nose,

302
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,639
the bottom of the fangs, end of the braids.

303
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,950
It makes a kind of X.

304
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,749
Let's get to it.

305
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,550
If I can get DIRT in there
with some of the newer firepower...

306
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,835
End the riot today
and start funeraIs tomorrow?

307
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,559
- I can contain this.
- Warden, I got a caII for you.

308
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,758
- Not now.
- I think you shouId take it. It's the governor.

309
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,751
- Governor.
- Where's my daughter?

310
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,116
Not to worry, sir. She's fine.
She's in Sick Bay in B-Wing.

311
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,829
It's a different part of the faciIity,
Iocked off from the disturbance.

312
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,277
That's what you're caIIing a riot nowadays?
Can these animaIs get to her?

313
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,148
Sir, it's impossibIe for anyone
from A-Wing to get into Sick Bay.

314
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,710
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under controI.

315
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,917
For your sake, you'd better hope you do.

316
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,797
(helicopter overhead)

317
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,390
I'm gonna dance with you, Doc!

318
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm gonna dance tiII the sun come up!

319
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,355
- Come on, Doc!
- Open the door!

320
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,070
- AII right. It's your turn.
- No. I ain't messing with no diablo.

321
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,038
We can't afford downtime.
We have to switch off with the driIIing.

322
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,478
It's bad mojo. You kidding? I mess with him,
you driII into him, he gets pissed. Then what?

323
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,996
I got enough enemies aIready, papi. OK?

324
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,878
- You beIieve in God, right?
- You know I do.

325
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,919
So you're protected. He'II protect you.

326
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,355
From him.

327
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,310
(shouting and cheering)

328
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,076
GentIemen!

329
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,390
Oh, gentIemen!

330
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,270
I assure you, once Bob and I
are done getting acquainted...

331
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,032
We bIaze him!

332
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,556
..everyone eIse wiII get their turn.

333
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,314
We're gonna have a IittIe fun, Bobby.

334
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,076
Don't worry.
I don't got the bIickey. My pipes are cIean.

335
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,230
Where are you going, rookie?

336
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,117
No, no, no, no.

337
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,111
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,113
They aIways think they can run away.

339
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,996
Got a question for you, fish.

340
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,316
What if we do aII this work
and the pipe is ten feet that way?

341
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,039
- It won't be.
- Have you got X-ray vision?

342
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,240
I caIcuIated the driII point coordinates, hid
them in my tattoo and projected it on the waII.

343
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,472
Everything's been worked out so the image
hits the right spot. It's just math.

344
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,869
What if your math is wrong?

345
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,758
You'II driII into
one of a dozen gas Iines behind the waII.

346
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,436
There'II be an expIosion
and we'II be burned aIive.

347
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,753
But you're good at math, right?

348
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,915
They're breaking out.

349
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,151
They're breaking...

350
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,031
Shh.

351
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,639
(shouting continues)

352
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,675
(glass smashes)

353
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,228
Come on! Come on!

354
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,550
Open up!

355
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,233
Open it up! Come on!

356
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,995
Yo, Stroke.
You got Ionger arms than me, man.

357
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,839
Agh! Son of a...

358
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,751
That bitch stuck me.

359
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,278
You think it's hot now?
I want aII the water shut off.

360
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,478
- I'II caII Maintenance.
- Mack, you take care of it.

361
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,551
Yes, sir.

362
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,470
Yeah, we... we have a probIem.

363
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,032
That's right. Yeah, Bob here's seen the hoIe.
He's gotta go away.

364
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,117
- No one's going anywhere.
- He's seen the hoIe.

365
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,634
So have you.

366
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,508
Looks Iike your Iockdown idea
didn't work out too good, huh?

367
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,273
I have a daughter. PIease.

368
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,157
- We gotta kiII him.
- The cops are right outside.

369
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,279
And they'II stay outside.
As Iong as they know we're keeping him aIive.

370
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,310
- But he's a guard. He's gonna squeaI.
- What the heII does this have to do with you?

371
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,119
This is not any of your concern.

372
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,151
Hm.

373
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,073
See, Bob here knows about our secret.

374
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,754
He knows about our escape.

375
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,873
So it's aII of our concern now, isn't it?

376
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,399
Easy, big feIIa. It's just me.

377
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,552
Looks Iike you took a pretty good hit.

378
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,835
Cons got that rook guard in Gen Pop. Kid's
probabIy dead aIready, or wishing he was.

379
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,832
- Where's ScofieId?
- Haven't seen him.

380
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,117
- I gotta find him.
- You Iooking for ScofieId?

381
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,191
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

382
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,153
Now you Iisten, pervert. You're in
as much troubIe as he is. You understand?

383
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,277
Go ahead. Go ahead. Stick me, stick me.

384
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,399
Let's see how many times I can shout out
about your IittIe hoIe before I bIeed out.

385
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,237
Every con's gonna know about your escape
before one drip of my bIood hits the fIoor.

386
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,915
So you see, friends,
either I'm through that hoIe with you

387
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,309
or I'm gonna sing Iike Johnny Cash.

388
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,551
Open the door!

389
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,318
Hey, yo! Check it!
Stroke is about to get the doc.

390
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,318
- Finish what we started.
- Where are you going?

391
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,631
- Sick Bay.
- There's no way to B-Wing. We're Iocked out.

392
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,950
I'm not. No one touches the CO.

393
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,991
No one.

394
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,428
You gonna cIue me in, paisano?

395
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,958
Be faster if we cut through here.

396
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,669
Burrows is as good as dead.

397
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,351
(banging and yelling)

398
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,792
Yeah! We're coming to get you!

399
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,717
Open it up!

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,831
(man) previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,309
- I didn't kiII that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,311
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,792
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,519
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,229
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the vice president's brother.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,754
- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,910
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossibIe.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,276
- Not if you designed the pIace.
- You've seen the bIueprints.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,749
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,671
I spoke to your mother.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,911
- If you mean that guy at Fox River...
- He refuses to caII him his father.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,036
Take the onIy thing Burrows has Ieft.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,351
The chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,916
(woman) And now scenes
from last week's episode.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,675
ConstantIy coming up here for count won't
Iet me do what I need to do to get through.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,035
The onIy way to stop count is a Iockdown.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,156
You'd better get the inmates riled up.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,155
AII right! That's it! Lockdown!

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,959
The anonymous caIIer
couIdn't have seen LincoIn.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,032
- How do you know?
- Because the caII came from Washington DC.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,434
This is BeIIick. Our wing has been breached.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,033
Hooke's Law of eIasticity.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,716
If we driII hoIes in strategic Iocations, we
compromise the waII's Ioad-carrying capacity.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,394
- Take the cuffs off.
- A rookie CO.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,597
- Get out of here, T-Bag.
- I think we can work something out.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,352
No deaI.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,515
- (governor) Where's my daughter?
- (warden) She's fine.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,910
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under controI.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,672
You'd better hope you do.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,918
They're breaking out.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,831
They're breaking...

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,319
Shh.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,119
- We need a favour.
- Heavy hitters want this done.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,192
Burrows is as good as dead.
You Iooking for ScofieId?

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,272
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,238
Hey, yo! Stroke is about to get the doc.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,956
Finish what we started.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,679
No one touches the CO. No one.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,348
(inmates shouting and yelling)

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,392
(pA) Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,436
Secure the perimeter.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,157
Remove private vehicles from all areas.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,835
Attention. The area is on secure lockdown.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,195
Let's go!

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,195
- Any word from the governor?
- Not yet, boss.

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,676
- BeIIick! Get those guys in Iine.
- Get 'em into formation.

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,432
- Going back in?
- Not yet.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,638
We cut the water off about an hour ago.
The stink aIone shouId drive 'em out of there.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,235
- You think that's gonna work?
- No, but it's protocoI.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,390
And we're aII gonna do this by the book.

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,109
- It's the best chance we have.
- (inmate) Hey!

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,318
This is the warden.
What's happening in there?

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,356
We got some demands.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,874
TeII them we need the air back on.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,916
We need the AC.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,710
We got a hostage - the guard.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,314
We got a hostage - the new guard.

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,311
Find out who's in there.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,956
They got Bob.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,555
And the girI doctor. TeII him we got her.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,789
- Why don't you do it?
- I don't wanna get shot.

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,756
And we got the girI doctor.

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,718
- The doctor?
- There's onIy one.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,588
How the heII did that happen?
How did they get their hands on her?

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,673
- I thought she was safe in Sick Bay.
- We gotta get her out. We gotta go in now.

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,797
- We can't do it, sir.
- Why not?

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,110
It's not by the book.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,358
Sir, I've got some updates for you.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,435
HeIp!

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,631
HeIp!

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,950
ScofieId's in here?

73
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,712
Argh!

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,189
You sure he's in here?

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,112
Turk.

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,311
Turk.

77
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
You ain't gonna use that.

78
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,795
You making up the ruIes now, ese?

79
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,431
- It's my house. You got a probIem?
- Yeah, I got a probIem. We aII do.

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,476
No probIem.

81
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,556
I swear to God. I'm not gonna say anything.
I didn't see anything.

82
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,428
That's right, badge. You didn't see nothing.

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,554
Wait. Don't Ieave.

84
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,152
Sorry. I'II be back.

85
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,677
Don't worry. I'II cover for you.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,993
Don't worry, CO. AII right?
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,116
I'm part of the team now.

88
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,555
HeIp a brother out. Drag that over.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,072
That's the way. Mm-hm-hm-hm.

90
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,071
(banging)

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,436
PIease return to your seats
and fasten your seatbeIts.

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,911
We are making our finaI approach
into Washington DC.

93
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,549
We need to focus on the reaI question.

94
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,710
Who wanted Terrence Steadman dead?

95
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,394
The caII came from DC.
What does that teII you?

96
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,790
You gotta think past the government.
Anybody couId be here.

97
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,553
A business partner, a rivaI.

98
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,313
Before Steadman was kiIIed,
EcoFieId introduced

99
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,472
a prototype eIectric engine
at the techno conference.

100
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,156
$60 barreIs of oiI wouId be obsoIete
if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

101
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,959
CouId be oiI. OiI companies.

102
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,794
SuppIiers, consumers, everything in between.

103
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,429
Or the government of an oiI-based economy.

104
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,114
Like the United States.

105
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,476
- Can I take your soda?
- Sure. Thank you.

106
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,239
At any rate, we Iand, we meet my guy,

107
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,393
and even if we don't find the person
who tipped off the cops, we find his phone.

108
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,313
The paper traiI begins.

109
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,391
(shouting continues)

110
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,871
OnIy a matter of time, Doc.
It's onIy a matter of time.

111
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,157
HeIp!

112
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,551
(police siren)

113
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,960
That's the governor.

114
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,555
Whatever happens, don't say anything.

115
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,831
Governor. Appreciate you coming.

116
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,755
Since our conversation, the situation has
escaIated. But we're making good progress...

117
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,073
Just cut the crap, Warden,
and teII me where my daughter is.

118
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,150
HeIp!

119
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,597
HeIp!

120
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,236
(T-Bag) We got here TyIer Robert Hudson.

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,390
That is fancy, CO!

122
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,677
And Iook at that address - 144 Oak Park...

123
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,199
- What's this?
- Terrace.

124
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,508
Terrace. How'd you swing that, CO?

125
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,071
Sounds Iike you're about something,
Iiving on a terrace.

126
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,549
I can't wait to kick it on a terrace. What?

127
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,792
Oh.

128
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,358
- This here must be your daughter.
- Put it back.

129
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,431
Prom?

130
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,118
You know what they say
about a prom dress, don't you?

131
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,514
She didn't come home that night, did she?

132
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,195
No, she wore that aII night Iong.

133
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,794
Next morning...

134
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,749
she had to throw that dress in the trash can
behind the moteI so her momma didn't see...

135
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,479
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

136
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,509
- What the heII are you doing?
- Kicking with Deputy Dawg. TaIking women.

137
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,712
I'II be very cIear here,
because you and I face an evoIutionary gap.

138
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,232
You ain't gonna hurt this man.
We're Iocked into this thing now.

139
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,912
Understand?

140
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,598
And he's the onIy Ieverage we have.

141
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,748
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

142
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,351
Now, do we have an understanding?

143
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,671
I'm on your side now. You understand me?

144
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,115
I'm just going with the fIow.

145
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,478
You Iet me know
when you're done with your ''Ieverage''.

146
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,151
Let me out!

147
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,588
Let's smoke the bitch out!

148
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,031
(banging)

149
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,271
(Sara) HeIp!

150
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,038
What are you thinking now, Doc?
(cackles)

151
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,031
It ain't gonna hurt reaI bad
if you make it easy.

152
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,078
If you make it hard, though...

153
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,591
Open the door! Come here!
Open this door! Open this door!

154
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,194
Come on. Grab my hand.

155
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,240
Come on!

156
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,190
Come here. Open the door. Open this door!

157
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,591
I've got you.

158
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,917
Are you aII right?
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

159
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,076
See these pipes?
We're gonna stay on them.

160
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,711
They go through the waII and over the
haIIway and they'II get us out of here.

161
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,678
AII you have to do is foIIow me.

162
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,273
- OK?
- Yeah.

163
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,032
OK.

164
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,838
Let's go.

165
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,111
Where did she go?

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,071
(chuckling)

167
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,512
- Where are we meeting him?
- Georgetown. In a garage.

168
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,675
He's a private investigator. He used
to be my roommate in freshman year at Duke.

169
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,797
- (reporter) The disturbance has escalated.
- Nick, Iook.

170
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,348
At least two hostages have been confrmed

171
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,468
in what is now being called a full-scale riot
here at the Fox River State penitentiary.

172
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,710
ShouId we go back or keep going?

173
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,791
We shouId keep going.

174
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,069
You wanna go back and stand there with
the rest of the peopIe who aren't heIping?

175
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,832
Come on.

176
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,710
The National Guard responded after Frank
Tancredi declared a state of emergency...

177
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,678
- Come on, honey. It's time to go.
- HoId on. HoId on.

178
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,514
- No word on what caused the disturbance.
- That's not Fox River?

179
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,194
Tensions often run high at this facility.

180
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,636
Fox River is a level-fve institution,
housing dangerous...

181
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,075
- What are you doing?
- We have to go. Come on.

182
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,474
- No. Dad might be in troubIe.
- He's aIready in troubIe. We can do nothing.

183
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,313
Just don't make a scene, OK?

184
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,109
He gets very uncomfortabIe with this thing.
Just... Let's just go.

185
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,510
Oh, God forbid, man!

186
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,879
We're just taIking about my oId man here
and his Iife, if that's aII right with you?

187
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,428
- Leave me out of this.
- I am Ieaving you out of it.

188
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,397
I Ieft you out of it the day I met you.

189
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,392
Nothing in her Iife or mine
has anything to do with you.

190
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,040
- I'II pretend I didn't hear that.
- Yeah? Or what?

191
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,476
- This is the kind of crap I have to deaI with.
- Let me handIe it!

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,350
The kind of crap you have to deaI with?!
You got no cIue, do you?

193
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,155
- Honey...
- Leave me aIone! Get off me.

194
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,234
- Don't touch your mother Iike that. Take that.
- Stop it! Stop!

195
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,230
Go upstairs, LJ, now!

196
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,038
Go!

197
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,838
- You Iove that man?
- Just go.

198
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,718
- You Iove that man?
- Do what I say.

199
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,755
(coughing)

200
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,670
Turk, why are you doing this? Who sent you?

201
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,590
Why? Why?

202
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,834
Why did you do this?
What's it aII about? Who sent you?

203
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,994
Aren't you gonna heIp me?
You've gotta heIp me. PIease.

204
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,351
Turk!

205
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,431
(prays in Spanish)

206
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,510
- Who is your friend?
- You scared the heII out of me.

207
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,911
Who are you taIking to?

208
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,755
It's the fish's idea. The deviI marks the waII
so you know where to driII the hoIes.

209
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,756
- You're making hoIes with an egg beater?
- Crazy, huh? It's caIIed the Hooker Law.

210
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,949
He says that if you poke the exact right hoIes
in something big and strong, it gets weak.

211
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,598
That's true.

212
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,275
When the waII is weak, we can take it down.

213
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,835
- At Ieast that's the pIan.
- Yeah. That's aIways the pIan.

214
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,116
You shouId never underestimate a waII.

215
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,919
You see, sometimes,

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,039
no matter how hard you try,
itjust won't give in.

217
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,312
- Are you aII right?
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

218
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,071
Don't Iet 'em get away.

219
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,151
(all talk at once)

220
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,479
You know what? I need a minute. I'm sorry.

221
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,552
- It's not much further.
- Just a sec.

222
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,995
We can stop if you want. Catch your breath.

223
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,197
OK. Yeah, I couId use a minute.

224
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,549
- Come here, girI. Come here.
- Things shouId be winding down now.

225
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,758
Pretty soon, the powers that be
wiII break in and it'II aII be over.

226
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,513
It's just a matter of time.

227
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,319
What's happening in A-Wing?

228
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,795
AII heII's breaking Ioose.

229
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,315
But I think if we stay up here,
we shouId be OK.

230
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,555
I can't beIieve this is happening.

231
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,030
Yeah. Come here.
Gonna catch you reaI good, Doc.

232
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,272
I miss you, girI.
I know you want it, girI.

233
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,311
You ever been to Baja?

234
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,151
Mexico?

235
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,710
There's this great pIace down there.
20 bucks a night.

236
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,394
Hammock on the back deck.

237
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,074
Beers are 50 cents.

238
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,151
25 cents at happy hour.

239
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,914
You ever been to ThaiIand? ThaiIand's great.

240
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,278
MichaeI, if you're trying to caIm me down,
you're doing a terribIe job.

241
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,635
But I am trying.

242
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,871
Shh! You hear that?

243
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,872
- Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

244
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,432
CrawIing around in the ceiIing,
risking your Iife.

245
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,559
You needed heIp and... I came to find you.

246
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,153
How did you know where to go?

247
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,317
When everything went off in A-Wing, the COs
Ieft the station and I saw you on the monitor.

248
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,279
One of my first assignments on PI,
we were up here cIeaning out toxic mouId.

249
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,275
Took days, so I'm
kind of famiIiar with the Iayout.

250
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,670
- Hope you wore a mask.
- Excuse me?

251
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,878
To prevent inhaIation.
MouId can be reaIIy dangerous.

252
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,394
Yeah, I wore a mask.

253
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,715
Get up there. Get up there.

254
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,953
The door to the visitation room -
do you ever use it?

255
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,749
Um... Not usuaIIy,
but my access card shouId work.

256
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,479
(Stroker) Get up.

257
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,718
Psst.

258
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,189
Come on.

259
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,430
Let's go.

260
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,673
Come here.

261
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,751
Let's go!

262
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,948
Dammit! Come here!

263
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,077
I understand.
But beIieve me, Sara is our top priority.

264
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,597
The heII she is!
I ordered a state of emergency an hour ago.

265
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,399
- Get me your commanding officer.
- Right away.

266
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,632
- Now what the heII is going on out here?
- Negotiating. They can't hoId out for Iong.

267
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,156
- Negotiating?
- It's 100 degrees. They're aImost out of water.

268
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,834
We are trying to avoid
doing anything extreme.

269
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,152
I don't care if it takes a massacre to get
her out of there. Do you understand me?

270
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,708
- If you're not going to do it, I am.
- Sir.

271
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,588
- Captain, spread the news - you're going in.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,433
It's time to do this my way.

273
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,031
Come here! Come here!

274
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,111
(shouting)

275
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,111
AII right.

276
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,111
I got you.

277
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,357
Hey, fish! You gonna keep that nurse
aII to yourseIf?

278
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,791
(Stroker roars)

279
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,669
Stop!

280
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,111
(screaming)

281
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,911
Agh! My knee!

282
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,431
Come on. This way.

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,673
Good caII, Governor, bringing in the big guns.

284
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,117
- Appreciate your support.
- Captain Brad BeIIick.

285
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,309
I sent you a Ietter earIier this year -
my views on penaI reform.

286
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,630
Oh. And what are they?

287
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,752
These inmates don't mess around.
Us COs need to get tough.

288
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,718
Warden Pope's a good guy,
but he doesn't understand

289
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,395
that you gotta grab the situation
by the gonads and take controI.

290
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,155
- And is that what you wouId do?
- Yes, sir. That's exactIy what I'd do.

291
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,673
So...

292
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,789
Give me that. Give me that.

293
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,510
- I don't know if...
- Give me that. DemoIition runs in the famiIy.

294
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,989
The whoIe trick is pressure.

295
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,751
Where shouId I...? Here? Good.

296
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,960
You see, you shouId push hard, but not
too hard. Just Iike when you, you know...

297
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,110
- But you gotta be carefuI.
- Yeah, I know.

298
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,317
I mean it. One sIip and you'II hit the gas pipe.

299
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,913
Gas pipe?

300
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,117
Yeah, you know,
as in pipe that carries the gas.

301
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,639
- We can't go this way.
- We have to. There's no other way.

302
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,836
- This is it.
- No, it's not.

303
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,475
- It's back this way.
- This won't heIp.

304
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,039
- Trust me.
- If you're wrong...

305
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,315
We don't have time.

306
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,396
Not too hard. Not too soft.

307
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,832
When I was her age, I had such bad skin.

308
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,310
Acne, they caIIed it.

309
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,230
She Iooks just Iike aII them girIs
that made fun of me.

310
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,834
After I kiII you,

311
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,310
I'm gonna crawI out that hoIe
and caII me up a Iimousine

312
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,915
and me and your baby's going to the prom.

313
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,397
- What's the news with Sara?
- StiII trying to find her.

314
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,600
- You don't even know where she is?
- We're on it. Once we do, we'II Iet you know.

315
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,116
You shouId Iisten to Captain BeIIick
and gas the whoIe bIock.

316
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,318
- Captain BeIIick?
- He knows what these guys can do.

317
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,994
You'd better pray
that Sara gets out in one piece.

318
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,072
I do, Governor, but this is stiII my prison.

319
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,914
Whatever happens, I take fuII responsibiIity.

320
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,195
Excuse me.

321
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,672
It's this way.

322
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,351
Yeah.

323
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,155
Yes! We're through.

324
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
Time to put this theory to the test.

325
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,674
I guess we start chipping away now.

326
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,432
Right on.

327
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,511
She's aII yours, paI.

328
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,271
This is it.

329
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,671
We did it.

330
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,549
That's it.

331
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,390
- Wait. I can't Ieave you here.
- You have no choice. I'm a bad guy.

332
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,715
AII right, go, man. Go, go, go!

333
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,360
Come on, man. Through there. Check this out.

334
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,829
- (man over radio) Can you see the assailant?
- Affirmative. I've got him in sight.

335
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,754
What are you gonna do?

336
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,400
Go back to my ceII. Stay out of the way.

337
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,357
- MichaeI.
- What?

338
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,437
They see us.

339
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,431
- You have to go.
- I can't. They'II kiII you.

340
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,918
You go out the door. I'II drop to the fIoor.

341
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,830
- They're sharpshooters. They won't miss.
- That's why you can't stay.

342
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,150
- What's going on?
- I'm coming, Doc.

343
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,639
Go!

344
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,719
(gunfre)

345
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,191
(loud rock music)

346
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,075
(Veronica) Who's this?

347
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,675
That's my guy.

348
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,756
- Hey.
- Nice ride.

349
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,956
Yeah. You Iike that?

350
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,474
Cop auction. 300 bucks.

351
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,829
You must be Veronica. Whoever tipped off the
cops about Burrows caIIed from this number.

352
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,395
That wasn't an easy trace.
I hope you're not too bummed.

353
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,473
- Why? What's the probIem?
- It's a payphone.

354
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,798
- This is it.
- Anyone couId have made that caII.

355
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,714
Any one of the miIIion peopIe
who pass through here every day.

356
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,268
That's empty.

357
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,552
What about that?

358
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,156
FederaI Energy Commission.
That's interesting.

359
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,679
- Where are you going?
- To see if this guy knows what was in there.

360
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,790
Excuse me.

361
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,156
Do you what was in that space before?

362
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,471
OK, thanks.

363
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,515
Hey. It was the regionaI headquarters
for a company caIIed EcoFieId.

364
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,149
- (Veronica) Terrence Steadman's company.
- (Nick) That's right.

365
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,831
(phone rings)

366
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,958
- HeIIo?
- (man) Veronica.

367
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,349
Who... who is this?

368
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,718
That's the problem, Veronica.
You ask too many questions.

369
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,836
Now l have one for you.

370
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,639
ls Lincoln Burrows really worth it?

371
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,756
Here, give me the phone.
Who is this?

372
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,991
(man) Nick Savrinn.
l just want to let you know,

373
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,674
as of now, both of you are dead.

374
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,031
Come on. Let's go.

375
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,036
(pA) All inmates have one minute
to return to their cells.

376
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,553
MichaeI!

377
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,320
MichaeI!

378
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,516
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

379
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,838
I didn't touch the man.
I didn't touch him. Ask him.

380
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,515
Things have changed since we Iast met.

381
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,236
ReIax, partner. I'm in on it now.

382
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,199
The rabbit pIan.
Know aII about it. So does the CO.

383
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,677
- Why'd you take Abruzzi down?!
- I didn't. He just showed up.

384
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,399
- And the paedophiIe thinks he's in!
- I know.

385
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,914
Shut up! Where's MichaeI?

386
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,991
Where's MichaeI?

387
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,354
MichaeI! MichaeI!

388
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,111
(pA) Final warning.

389
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,757
- Where have you been?
- AII over. Are you aII right?

390
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,434
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yes. Yes.

391
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,031
Move!

392
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,316
- We'II take it from here.
- Are you OK?

393
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,391
I'm OK.

394
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,954
- BeIIick.
- She's waIking. That's a good sign.

395
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,960
Yeah. Astute observation.

396
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,669
Maybe you'd Iike
to share that with the governor.

397
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,639
- I was tense. I was just trying...
- Next time you bad-mouth me to a superior,

398
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,032
there are gonna be serious consequences.
Do I make myseIf cIear, Captain?

399
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,429
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

400
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,196
Sara!

401
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,555
Sara. Sara.

402
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,270
- Dad.
- Sara. Are you aII right? Are you OK?

403
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,989
I toId you when you took this job.
I knew something Iike this wouId happen.

404
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,116
I knew something Iike this wouId happen.

405
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,476
God, Dad, how about,
''I'm happy to see you aIive''?

406
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,870
WeII, I just want you to see
what you're doing to yourseIf.

407
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,635
There is nobody
that is forcing you to be here.

408
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,711
I know. Thanks, Dad.

409
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,433
AII right. Let's cIean this mess up.

410
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,991
(alarm)

411
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,072
- What's going on?
- We did it.

412
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,958
Those IittIe Hooker hoIes were right on.

413
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,349
Get everyone out of here. EspeciaIIy him.

414
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,149
- I'm gonna take care of him myseIf.
- You're not gonna kiII him.

415
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,959
- I'm not coming back.
- It's over! We don't need him.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,476
- You're not gonna kiII him.
- You're gonna Iet him waIk?

417
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,916
- That ain't for you to decide!
- After aII he's seen?!

418
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,514
- After aII he's seen.
- Get out!

419
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,273
Keep your mouth shut and turn Ieft.

420
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,191
Get out!

421
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,872
If we have a probIem,
we know where to find you.

422
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,837
Mau-mau.

423
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,758
Forget about it. Just forget about it, aII right?

424
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,751
No!

425
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,551
One for the team.

426
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,992
OK, so this is a compIete Iist
of the injured and the dead.

427
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,310
- And it's the whoIe Iist?
- Yeah.

428
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,391
Thank you, very much.

429
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,911
Hey, Ron.

430
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,433
Dr Tancredi.
GIad to see you made it out aIive.

431
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,511
Yeah. Me too.

432
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,797
Question.

433
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,795
Why did your department assign inmates
on PI to do a toxic mouId removaI project?

434
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,440
What toxic mouId project?

435
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,951
In the crawI space in A-Wing.

436
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,596
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

437
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,870
- OK, sorry.
- No probIem.

I'II get you out.

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,794

- Not if you designed the pIace.

As of now, both of you are dead.

And this here must be your daughter.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,112
- It's over. We don't need him.
- You're not gonna kiII him.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,350
One for the team.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,709
(Michael) 17 days from now,
they strap my brother to an electric chair.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,238
Send 50,000 volts coursing through his body
for a crime he didn't commit.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,993
l'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,791
l've been in Fox River
nearly three weeks now.

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,110
ln that time,
l've got out the back of my cell

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,716
and into the old steam pipes
that run beneath the prison.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,712
Those pipes are our way out.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,034
Think of this pIace Iike it's a map of the US.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,510
Our ceII over there, that's New York City.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,319
The infirmary, our exit, that's CaIifornia.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,154
- The pipes beneath us that connect the two...
- Route 66.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,549
Route 66. Our ticket out of here.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,871
- I assume we're doing this at night?
- That's right.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,794
We're Iocked up, fish,
and your boy is in soIitary.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,829
How we just gonna fIy out of our cages and
right into your ceII, right into New York City?

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,399
You're not.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,510
You're gonna meet me haIfway.
In St Louis.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,515
Route 66 runs beneath that buiIding. It's the
onIy buiIding sitting on top of those tunneIs.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,879
AII we gotta do is get in there, on PI,
and dig ourseIves an on-ramp.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,714
ShortIy after, we hit the infirmary.
Then we'II be outside those waIIs.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,997
- What's in there?
- It's an oId storage room.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,629
- John here can pull all the strings.
- (John) lt's not that easy, fsh.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,236
That's a restricted area.
I gotta be abIe to justify it to the buIIs.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,154
There's gotta be some actuaI work
to be done in there for me to get in there.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,553
Then you better figure it out. Cos if we don't
get in that room, we're not getting out of here.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm feeIing kind of Ieft out.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,953
New York, CaIifornia, St Louis.
What are we discussing?

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,191
- We're taIking basebaII, actuaIIy.
- Oh.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
Now, that's a subject I know quite a bit about.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,673
What a shame. The conversation's over.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,038
ReaIIy, now.
That any way to treat a team-mate?

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,432
I'm coming aIong on this endeavour
whether you Iike it or not.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,354
Cos I got a heII of a singing voice otherwise.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,277
I won't take that piece of crap aIong.
I won't do it.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,793
Me neither.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,509
We won't have to.
He'II be out of the picture soon enough.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,800
The state provides $25,000 insurance,

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,997
pIus donations from
the Corrections Officers' Foundation...

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,835
That's the Iast thing on my mind
right now, Warden.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,754
- Do you know who kiIIed him?
- We have some Ieads.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,312
But I can promise you this. We are not
gonna rest untiI we find out what happened.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,190
His pictures are missing.
He had a photo of our daughter in here.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,190
Not to worry. We'II find them.

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,396
I begged him not to take this job.

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,959
Shauna.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,793
I am so sorry.

64
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,473
I'II waIk you to your car.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,393
Captain, I need to speak with you
for a second.

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,075
(Bellick) I'II meet you in the haIIway.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,439
I want the son of a bitch who did this.

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,910
Now, you do whatever
you need to do to find him.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,991
You understand.

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,751
We got five boxes. Wanna give me a hand?

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,954
Veronica.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,670
That caII was scare tactics. They want to scare
us from doing what they know we can do.

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,990
- And what's that?
- Expose them.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,752
Is this guy bothering you again?

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,628
No, Lukasz, the other night was my fauIt.
It was a misunderstanding.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,711
OK. But if you need anything...

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,429
Trust me, you'II be the first person I caII.

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,273
Here, Iet me.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,910
Those boxes contain
seven years of criminaI appeIIant work.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,195
If there's a precedent in there somewhere

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,750
that can heIp us suspend LincoIn's execution,
we're gonna find it.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,434
You can Ieave those by the door.
I'II bring them in.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,557
Oh, that's OK. I've got your key right here.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,712
If I didn't know better,
I'd say Lukasz was sweet on you.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,109
Very funny.

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,557
- Fire.
- What?

87
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,315
- Fire. We burn the pIace down.
- How's that gonna heIp us?

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,918
A few years ago, the chapeI burnt down and
the DOC reaIised they had some toxic issues.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,434
You know, asbestos, Iead paint, you name it.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,593
They couIdn't find a contractor
so they put the inmates on the job.

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,399
We spent, Iike, five, six hours
in there at a time.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,395
But the good news is,
no guards came around aImost at aII.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,198
Can you get us in there?

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,397
I've been doing a IittIe, uh... thinking.

95
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,074
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,713
I mean, that's where
this whoIe thing is happening, isn't it?

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,950
It's on its way.

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,597
- You're sIow-waIking me, aren't you?
- Why wouId I do that?

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,071
You think BeIIick's gonna pop me
for shanking that CO, Bob.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,875
Maybe you'II take a IittIe waIk, teII him for
yourseIf? And I'II be out of here for good.

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,190
WeII, I got news for you.

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,515
If I go down for kiIIing Bob, beIieve me,
I'm gonna take a IittIe waIk of my own.

103
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,435
TeII 'em about that hoIe
you got behind your toiIet.

104
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,638
So...

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,471
How about that PI card?

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,075
I don't know if you remember,
but that summer before fifth grade,

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,075
when I stayed with you a coupIe weeks, and
you thought I broke your gIass coffee tabIe?

108
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,435
(Lincoln) Mm?

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,512
And when you came home, I denied it.

110
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,799
But you toId me you couId care Iess
about the coffee tabIe,

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,440
you just didn't want me Iying to you.

112
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,911
And you said I'd feeI a Iot better
if I just toId you the truth.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,675
- And you promised not to be angry.
- I remember.

114
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,594
WeII, I broke it.

115
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,591
I know.

116
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,673
You know, if there's anything that you
want to get off your chest, you can teII me.

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,149
And I promise I won't get angry.

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,869
You want to know if I kiIIed that guy.

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,190
I, uh, went there
pIanning to do something wrong.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,671
But I didn't kiII that guy.

121
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,638
Someone's working hard
to make it Iook Iike I did.

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,315
Anyway, there's a chance
the execution may not happen.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,753
What?

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,949
Veronica's working on my case, and I got
a reporter coming who beIieves I'm innocent.

125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,713
So I ain't dead yet.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,394
LJ. Look at me.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,313
You gotta have faith, kid.

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,517
Just have a IittIe faith.

129
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,158
(phone rings)

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,356
KeIIerman.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,317
- (woman) WeII?
- Taken care of.

132
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,437
Good. Now move on to the second thing.

133
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,354
If you couId see what we're Iooking at...
Burrows is gonna get the message.

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,795
Which is what you've assured me of before.

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,758
Yet that message
keeps getting returned to sender.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,832
Now move on the second thing
and report back.

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,275
We're headed there now.

138
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,670
- You're thinking too much.
- Yeah. God forbid.

139
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,711
He'II toss every ceII in this bIock
untiI he finds the kiIIer.

140
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,190
He tosses this one, he'II find the hoIe
back there in a heartbeat.

141
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,510
I know.

142
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,478
(Sucre) We turn T-Bag in.
That's the onIy way it'II stop.

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,755
(Michael) We turn him in, he'II taIk.

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,551
So we're screwed either way, aren't we?

145
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,791
- Which one?
- Right there. St Louis.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,993
- What the heII are you doing here?
- CIeanup detaiI. We thought this was storage.

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,119
This Iook Iike storage to you, idiot?
It's a restricted area, a CO break room.

148
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,997
Now back it up.

149
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,753
- Back it up, now!
- (Abruzzi) Sorry, Officer.

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,718
It won't happen again.

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,399
- A freakin' break room? Are you kidding me?
- They must have changed it since the retrofit.

152
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,711
- The buIIs are camped out in there.
- Got a backup pIan?

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,476
There isn't one. It's the onIy room
on top of that pipe. We gotta get back in there.

154
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,632
- ImpossibIe, fish.
- Maybe not. Check it out.

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,988
(Sucre) I don't get it.
How come they Iet him in?

156
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,833
He's a trustee.
Ones with high security cIearance.

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,592
- Why him?
- He can be trusted.

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,593
- How does one become a trustee?
- Have a spotIess record for the Iast 30 years.

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,355
- Pretty much counts us out.
- Which means we've gotta get him on board.

160
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,318
Forget it. The guy's a boy scout.

161
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,315
Mr WestmoreIand.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,119
Hey, MichaeI.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,350
You found your cat yet?

164
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,238
StiII MIA.

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,915
- You couId aIways get another.
- I don't want another.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,037
Besides, it's a moot point.
She was grandfathered.

167
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,554
Once she's gone, no more pets.

168
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,030
WouIdn't be an issue
if you were on the outside.

169
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,554
StiII tugging on that Ieash, eh?

170
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,631
Yup.

171
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,678
And this is the part
where I extend a formaI invitation.

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,830
Cos you stiII think I'm DB Cooper?

173
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,876
I don't think. I know.

174
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,992
The way I see it, you're in here
doing 60 to Iife for vehicuIar mansIaughter.

175
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,470
It wouId have been 20,
but the car you were in was stoIen.

176
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,792
FeIony murder ruIe cubes every sentence.
And here you are.

177
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,433
Hitting that woman was an accident.
But the car? No one accidentaIIy steaIs a car.

178
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,991
So the question is, why wouId CharIes
WestmoreIand be in Arizona boosting a car

179
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,153
ten states away from where he Iived,
and onIy ten miIes from the Mexican border?

180
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,313
And why, two days before that, wouId
someone make a phone caII to his wife

181
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,995
from a moteI in PortIand,
a stone's throw away from the airport

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,837
out of which, shortIy after,
fIight 305 was hijacked by one DB Cooper?

183
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,390
Seven hours after the hijacking,
records show CharIes WestmoreIand

184
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,597
was treated for a busted knee
at a free cIinic in Brigham City.

185
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,468
OnIy way to get from PortIand, Oregon
to Brigham City, Utah in seven hours

186
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,678
is in a car breaking every Iand speed record
known to man,

187
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,318
or fIying.

188
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,190
It's pubIic record DB Cooperjumped out
of that 727 about an hour after takeoff.

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,957
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet with 1.5 miIIion
in cash and a hastiIy packed parachute

190
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,349
might make for a pretty rough Ianding.

191
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,594
Rough enough to shatter some bones.
Maybe even a Ieft knee.

192
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,353
DB Cooper wouId have
had a car waiting for him.

193
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,795
According to DMV records, in 1971

194
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,919
CharIes WestmoreIand was
the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,357
As it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova
with the registration number scraped off

196
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,353
was found abandoned with a bIown gasket
aIong the Arizona border,

197
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,557
a miIe or two away from where
you accidentaIIy hit that woman

198
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,438
with your stoIen car.

199
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,631
- Interesting story.
- Interesting man.

200
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,356
But you didn't answer one thing.

201
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,158
What's that?

202
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,352
Maybe I did hurt my knee,
I did steaI that car,

203
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,750
and I did accidentaIIy hit that poor Iady.

204
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,197
But how couId I have hijacked a pIane
in PortIand on November 24th

205
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,230
when I was in FoIsom
finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderIy?

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,515
I hope you weren't hanging
this whoIe escape on that money,

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,592
cos I'm not the one in possession of it.

208
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,114
Thanks for the invite, though.

209
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,711
Veronica.

210
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,795
Veronica, come on.

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,110
We're OK.

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,158
How is this OK, Nick?
Somebody just tried to kiII us.

213
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,196
- I know. I was there.
- Then act Iike it.

214
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,512
We just watched a man
burn to death right in front of us.

215
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,551
My God.

216
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,991
- Lukasz... My God.
- It's OK. It's OK.

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,833
We just Ieft him there.

218
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,515
There was nothing we couId do.
He was dead as soon as he opened the door.

219
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,832
I am trying so hard to understand aII this.
Who these peopIe are, what they want.

220
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,354
How we waIked away
without caIIing the poIice.

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,592
We did it because these peopIe we're
deaIing with won't stop untiI we're dead.

222
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,719
If they think we're dead,
maybe we get a IittIe breathing room.

223
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,678
- We shouId go to the poIice.
- I've been thinking the same.

224
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,072
But you know what?
They're bigger than the poIice.

225
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,674
We go to the authorities
we'II broadcast to them that we're stiII aIive,

226
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,275
and then we got that target
right on our backs again.

227
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,828
We can't hide forever.

228
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,753
No, no. Maybe not forever. But...

229
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,436
I think I know a pIace we can,
at Ieast for a IittIe whiIe.

230
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,310
We have to go in there ourseIves then.

231
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,119
Like I said,
unIess the oId man's in it's not possibIe.

232
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,557
And even if it were, the guards in there
won'tjust sit back and watch us start a fire.

233
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,519
See, I aIready figured that part out.
I been thinking.

234
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,319
- And?
- That thing you're doing in the Pope's office.

235
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,152
- You using rubber cement?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,071
- Can you get some out?
- Maybe. Why?

237
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,311
Look, there's a coffee maker
in the guards' room, right?

238
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,233
I got a hook-up
with one of my boys in the kitchen.

239
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,190
If we can get rubber cement in the bottom
of that coffee pot, when the burner goes on...

240
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,719
It's a good idea. But without WestmoreIand,
we're never getting in that room.

241
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,870
- He doesn't want any part of this?
- No.

242
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,238
Then what does he want?
He's gotta want something.

243
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,709
Everybody wants something.

244
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,435
(Michael) Come on, kitty. Come on.

245
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,476
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

246
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,716
Yes. That's a good girI. Come on.

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,951
I don't beIieve it.

248
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,791
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

249
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,431
- Where'd you find her?
- In the yard, by the chapeI.

250
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,149
Why do I get the feeIing
there's a string attached to this?

251
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,800
Not a string. Just a favour.

252
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,119
- I'm not DB Cooper.
- That's aII right.

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,795
Cos it's not gonna take DB Cooper
to do what I need done.

254
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,190
- What's that?
- AII I want you to do

255
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,116
is take a certain coffee pot into the guard
room at a certain time, and turn the burner on.

256
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,394
Why?

257
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,792
Let's just say it'd be in everyone's
best interests if a fire were to start in there.

258
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,873
MariIyn, did you think
he was the arsonist type?

259
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,350
I'm not. I'm the cIeanup crew type.

260
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,319
The type that gets access
to aII kinds of tooIs.

261
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,468
MichaeI, I'm gratefuI for this, I reaIIy am,

262
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,519
but I've made it a point to keep my nose cIean
ever since I waIked into this pIace.

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,194
32 years without a bIemish.

264
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,955
If that paroIe board date ever comes,
I want to be ready.

265
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,476
I can'tjeopardise that. Sorry.

266
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,637
MichaeI.

267
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,676
Thanks, though. ReaIIy.

268
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,030
After what you went through in the riot,
I thought you'd take a day off.

269
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm fine.

270
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,478
I, uh... I couIdn't find anybody
to cover for me, anyway.

271
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,631
I hope you don't feeI
Iike you owe me anything.

272
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,312
I do.

273
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,391
I'm, uh...

274
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,236
I reaIIy appreciate what you did for me.

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,590
But?

276
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,635
But you toId me that
you had been up in the crawIspace for PI,

277
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,474
and PI was never assigned to go there.

278
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,476
We're done here, right?

279
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,236
MichaeI, don't be Iike that.
I just... I just want some answers.

280
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,550
Thanks for the shot, Doc.

281
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,713
- Sue Parsons, HeadIine Press.
- Thanks for coming by.

282
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,759
- I appreciate you taking the time.
- I appreciate you Iooking at my case.

283
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,718
So what can you teII me?
From what I understand,

284
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,837
you have numerous peopIe
working on your behaIf as we speak.

285
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,672
Yeah. Um, weII...

286
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,357
Veronica Donovan, she's my attorney, and
Nick Savrinn. He works at Project Justice.

287
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,715
Savrinn. OK.

288
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,591
- Have they gotten very far?
- Nothing to go to court with. Not yet, anyway.

289
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,276
You ever think it's just time to Iet go?
Accept what happened?

290
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,989
Let go, yeah.
Accept what happened? Never.

291
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,358
I mean, wouId you? If someone
had set you up, destroyed your Iife?

292
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,468
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the anguish
it's caused your friends and Ioved ones.

293
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,554
PeopIe who care about me beIieve me. That's
aII that matters to me now. It's aII I've got.

294
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,668
- You have a son. LincoIn Jr. LJ.
- Yeah. Why?

295
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,955
I have a source that teIIs me

296
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,191
if you accept what happened
and stop fighting your execution,

297
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,271
your son wiII be Ieft out of this.

298
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,115
If not, I hope you said goodbye to him
when he Ieft here this morning.

299
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,237
- Who are you?
- One Burrows is gonna die.

300
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,719
Up to you which one.

301
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
Who are you? Who are you?

302
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,829
Don't Iet her go! She threatened my son.

303
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,549
PIease, no! Not my son!

304
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,631
(doorbell)

305
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,310
- LJ Burrows?
- Yeah?

306
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,552
I'm Officer HaIe, JuveniIe Court.
We need to do a survey of the residence,

307
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,189
make sure your environment
refIects the terms of your probation.

308
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,273
- Your parents home?
- No, but they'II be home any minute.

309
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,989
WeII then. I'II get started.

310
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,679
LJ and his dad.
You never said how it went.

311
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,469
Sounded fine. Everything a 15-year-oId boy
teIIs his mother is fine.

312
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,313
No offence, but can I see
some kind of identification?

313
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,311
- Sure.
- LJ, we're home.

314
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,195
LJ, you here?

315
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,838
- Oh, my God.
- Drop the phone, Iady.

316
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,912
This is the onIy warning I'm giving you.
Drop it.

317
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,552
Run!

318
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,629
No!

319
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,878
Pick up. Pick up, pIease.
PIease answer, come on.

320
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,313
LJ? We're not here to hurt you.

321
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,794
Uh-uh.

322
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,839
911, send.

323
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,196
You reaIIy think you're gonna get
to four buttons before I get to one?

324
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,479
Come on.

325
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,630
LJ, get out of here!

326
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,071
Mom?

327
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,831
(phone rings)

328
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
- (Kellerman) Where you going?
- What do you want?

329
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,951
Cooperation. That's aII.

330
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,079
You want cooperation?
I know what you Iook Iike, you son of a bitch.

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,355
- I'm going to the poIice.
- The poIice.

332
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,389
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ, with
your prints on the murder weapon and aII.

333
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,278
- I didn't touch the murder weapon.
- Of course not.

334
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,920
I know that, and you know that.

335
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,670
I don't think you'II have much Iuck
convincing BaIIistics of that.

336
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,036
- Who the heII are you peopIe?
- Just concerned neighbours.

337
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,588
Heard a bit of a ruckus at the Rixs' house.

338
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,194
Gosh, I guess we reaIIy
shouId have seen it coming.

339
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,034
AII the signs were there -
drug use, decIine in academic performance.

340
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,076
But we didn't think he'd do this.

341
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,674
- No one's gonna beIieve that.
- Yes, they will.

342
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,910
And when they catch you, and they wiII,

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,878
they'II try you as an aduIt.
You know what that means?

344
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,554
We can heIp you, LJ.
We're the onIy hope you got.

345
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,835
No, you're not. (hangs up)

346
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,788
She made that choice, not you.

347
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,830
Let's find the kid.

348
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
You got MariIyn back.

349
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,631
Sure did.

350
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,711
That's good.

351
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,917
- How Iong ago you quit smoking?
- Uh, a IittIe over nine years now.

352
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,991
You don't mind, do you?

353
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,398
I feeI a kinship with you, CharIes.

354
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,069
More than any other con here.

355
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,592
And we've seen a Iot. Haven't we?

356
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,910
Sure have.

357
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,389
Then correct me if I'm wrong.

358
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,391
I've aIways treated you fair.

359
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,074
I've aIways appreciated that fact.

360
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,717
I'd known Bob since he was 18 years oId.

361
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,791
I got him this job.

362
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,038
You can imagine how responsibIe I feeI.

363
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,111
I can't heIp you with that, boss.

364
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,193
I think you can.
Word is he died in front of your ceII.

365
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,192
And you were right here when it happened.

366
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,757
We've both been around
Iong enough to know

367
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,188
that when a con starts that snitching
business, he's not Iong for this worId.

368
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,317
Don't put me in that position, boss.

369
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,792
If you don't teII me who kiIIed Bob
before I Ieave this ceII,

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,875
our friendship goes with it.

371
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,269
That's a nice cat.

372
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,239
WestmoreIand knows.
And his jaw ain't that strong.

373
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,913
(cracking)

374
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,713
What's this?

375
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,950
Nothing.

376
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,952
- You staIker.
- I am not a staIker.

377
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,715
I just... I don't get it.

378
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,791
What is there to get?

379
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,075
He doesn't fit the profiIe.

380
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,312
Right? The man's got a graduate degree.
He Iives in my neighbourhood.

381
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,914
Guys that Iike hang out in StreeterviIIe,

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,833
they pay $200 for Cubs tickets.
They don't rob banks.

383
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,550
Maybe he couIdn't afford season tickets.
Maybe that's why he robbed the bank.

384
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,359
Thank you. I'm actuaIIy being serious.

385
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,795
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

386
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,428
- Why do you care so much?
- Cos he Iied to me.

387
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,954
They aII Iie to you.

388
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,078
Maybe because he's the one guy in here
I can actuaIIy get to.

389
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,948
The one guy I can make a difference with.

390
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,311
Go home, girI.
You keep burning it at both ends Iike this,

391
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,312
you're gonna drive yourseIf crazy.

392
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,391
Good night.

393
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,879
I'm sorry, Burrows. Both of them were dead
by the time the paramedics got there.

394
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,918
- What about my son?
- He's missing.

395
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,231
PoIice are treating him as a fugitive.

396
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,639
Fugitive?

397
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,156
They found his prints on the murder weapon.

398
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,198
That's impossibIe. I... I, uh...

399
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,999
- I need to caII him.
- No, I can't do that.

400
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,516
- What do you mean? His Iife's in danger!
- Look, Burrows.

401
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,831
The poIice instructed me
that this is an ongoing investigation.

402
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,230
And as such, any contact
you make with your son

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,632
couId potentiaIIy
aid and abet him as a fugitive.

404
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,198
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,396
Warden, pIease!

406
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,031
(man) Front gate open.

407
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,118
Let's go.

408
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,191
That's messed up, man.

409
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,238
- Jeez. Does he even know?
- I don't think so.

410
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,311
Man, here he is.

411
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,069
(Bellick) Go ahead, toss 'em.

412
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,111
What's up, T?

413
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,149
We're famiIy, right?

414
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,435
HeII, yeah. We are.

415
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,830
WeII, I'm in a quandary and I need your heIp.

416
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,149
Name it.

417
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,913
BeIIick's squeezing
tighter and tighter round here.

418
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,470
EventuaIIy somebody's mouth
is gonna start moving.

419
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,676
Thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this,

420
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,995
what with my priors
and predisposition to vioIent behaviour...

421
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,115
I'II spend the rest of my Iife in the SHU.

422
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,998
But if you come forward,

423
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,953
with onIy a drug conviction
and a whoIe Iotta remorse...

424
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,792
- I can't.
- I ain't finished.

425
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,273
No need. I ain't going down for murdering no
hack. I mean, you understand that, don't you?

426
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,112
You ain't mad, are you?

427
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,755
No, Trokey. I'm not mad.

428
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,870
I need out. I gotta find him.

429
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,394
You wiII. Both of us. Soon.

430
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,029
- They're coming after my famiIy.
- You gotta trust me. We're gonna...

431
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,429
''We're gonna get this done.'' How?

432
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,557
TeII me, MichaeI. TeII me.
You can't, can you?

433
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,200
I gotta get outta here now. LJ's in troubIe.

434
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,840
ScofieId. How about it?

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,070
Just stick with me.

436
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,394
Yo, Bruce. Hey.

437
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,551
(man) What's up, Ray?

438
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,870
- If you go out there they wiII gun you down.
- I don't care any more.

439
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,555
You better start thinking.
Cos you can't heIp LJ if you're dead.

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,235
What the heII's going on in here?
Huh? We got a probIem?

441
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,232
- No.
- WeII, then get on your feet. Let's go!

442
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,914
- (man) Fire!
- (alarm)

443
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,039
Son of a... What the heII's
going on at buiIding two? Come in.

444
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,953
(pA) Fire in the CO break room.

445
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,993
- Thanks.
- I didn't do it for you.

446
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,959
We found the source.
Someone in here smoke these?

447
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,395
BiIsons?

448
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,313
BeIIick.

449
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,359
(man) Captain BeIIick?
I've got someone to see you.

450
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,748
What the heII do you want?

451
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,308
I know who kiIIed Bob, sir.

452
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,111
Uh-oh.

453
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,994
I don't know how that got there.

454
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,518
It's a mock. It's a mock!
You set me up.

455
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,479
Bad enough that you kiIIed a guard.
Don't try to Iay it off on somebody eIse.

456
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,597
You set me up! He set me up...

457
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,835
- Wow.
- Your father Iived here?

458
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,515
Yeah. He wanted some pIace
that was compIeteIy off the grid,

459
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,909
a pIace the government
didn't know existed.

460
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,754
Tapped into the power Iines.
A weII suppIies the pIace with water.

461
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,912
Last few years of his Iife
he bareIy Ieft the property.

462
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,195
- It's...
- Yeah.

463
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,352
You spend so many years fighting
cops, prosecutors, judges

464
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,874
trying to take your freedom,

465
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,398
you use every cent you had in attorney's fees,
you wind up Iosing anyway...

466
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,118
15 years of his Iife.

467
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,278
AImost aII of his son's chiIdhood.

468
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,069
I guess I can forgive him
for wanting to hide away. Be Ieft aIone.

469
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,438
We'II be safe here
untiI we figure out our next move.

470
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,154
Hey, hoId up here a minute. HoId up, here.

471
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,472
Seems to be a bit of confusion.
I'm supposed to be on this detaiI.

472
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,551
I don't think so.

473
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,710
Oh, John.

474
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,870
You can't be serious.

475
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,233
Not after our Iong, iIIustrious history
we shared together.

476
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,916
AII those nights in New York City.

477
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,991
In CaIifornia.

478
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,914
In St Louis.

479
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,959
They were good times, weren't they, John?

480
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,716
TeII the badge here about 'em.
Cos if you don't want to...

481
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,995
I certainIy couId.

482
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,276
I want this pIace gutted. The dry waII's
gotta be torn out. Studs gotta be removed.

483
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,558
Boss, we've got some toxic issues here.
Asbestos to start with.

484
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,997
Take it up with the union. AII I'm saying
is this room's your onIy priority now.

485
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,799
It better be brand spanking new
when you're done.

486
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,510
If anybody's thinking about getting cute,
trying to trunk one of these tooIs out of here,

487
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,751
Brady's got the outIine
of every piece of hardware in here.

488
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,037
And at the end of every day,
every singIe piece better match up,

489
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,236
or you're aII going to the hoIe.

490
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,319
Let's go.

491
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,475
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main Iine beIow.

492
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,634
AII we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourseIves an on-ramp to Route 66.

493
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
They're gonna hear this, man.

494
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,949
They won't.

495
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,272
Come on, pretty. We're a team now.

496
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,914
- Best get crackin', eh?
- You. Shut up.

497
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,631
You really think you're gonna
get to four buttons before l get to one?

498
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,352
(woman) I don't have my gIasses.
How about you read this for me?

499
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,557
TeII me the news,
the Iatest deveIopments.

500
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,316
EvidentIy there was an expIosion in
a GoId Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday.

501
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,834
Gas Iine. Everyone inside was kiIIed.

502
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,876
(woman) Shame. Anything eIse?

503
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,555
How about that kid up in Oak Park,
the one who kiIIed his parents?

504
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,631
- Oh, they got him.
- They did?

505
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,836
- He's in custody.
- Good.

506
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,833
I imagine heads wouId have roIIed
if he hadn't been caught.

507
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,675
Lives wouId have been Iost.
How about you hand that back to me?

508
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,959
Now that it's yesterday's news,
we can put it behind us, can't we?

509
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,999
Move on to the next chapter of our Iives.

510
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,838
You're notjust doing this for me, you know.
Or my brother.

511
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,876
- (knocking)
- Yes?

512
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,589
They're ready for you, Madam Vice President.

513
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,638
You're doing it for your country.

514
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,669
- (woman) Madam Vice President...
- (man) Madam Vice President, a question...

00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,593
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,037
(Michael) Think of this pIace Iike a map of the
US. Our ceII over there, that's New York City.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,395
The infirmary, our exit, that's CaIifornia.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,994
The pipes beneath us that connect the two...

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,957
- Route 66.
- Our ticket out of here.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,909
Route 66 runs beneath that buiIding. It's the
onIy buiIding sitting on top of those tunneIs.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,391
AII we gotta do is get in there,
on PI, and dig ourseIves an onramp.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,631
- Which one?
- Right there.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,518
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main Iine beIow.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,798
AII we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourseIves an onramp to Route 66.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,519
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,831
You toId me that
you had been up in the crawIspace for PI,

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,708
and PI was never assigned to go there.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,917
We got you a IittIe get weII gift.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,639
What's your name?

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,793
There was an expIosion.
Gas Iine. Everyone inside was kiIIed.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,952
- These peopIe won't stop untiI we're dead.
- We can't hide forever.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,190
(Vp) How about that kid?
The one kiIIed his parents?

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,555
(Kellerman) Oh, they got him. He's in custody.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,756
I know what you Iook Iike, you son of a bitch.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,829
PhiIIy FaIzone.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,311
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,151
(Cherry) HeIp me.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,750
PIease.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,431
(T-Bag clears throat)

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,430
You'II have to forgive my boy.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,718
He has the propensity to be a bit gregarious
when he shouIdn't be.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,837
Fraternising in the prison shower. Come on.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,434
Maybe you oughta cut the kid a break.

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,557
You wouIdn't be meddIing in my affairs,
now, wouId you?

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,870
You can't be that stupid.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,919
Not whiIe I'm so fuIIy invested in your affairs.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,111
What's between you and him
is between you and him.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,835
That's what I thought you said.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,395
You've gotta heIp me.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,679
- (Lincoln) You gotta heIp me.
- This is a matter for the poIice.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,548
This is my son we're taIking about.
He's missing. Do something!

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,996
You have got to understand,
I am the warden of a prison.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,038
When it comes to the Iaw,
there is nothing I can do.

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,272
Whatever happens is out of my jurisdiction
untiI it comes through those gates.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,397
- Itjust did. Let me out.
- What?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,995
Let me find him. I know how he thinks.
I know where he'd run.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,359
I'd have thought by now you'd understand
your position as a death row inmate.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,715
There is no way I can honour that request.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,238
That ain't true. In case of a famiIy emergency,
you can grant an inmate supervised Ieave.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,313
Your son is a prime suspect
in a doubIe homicide.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,993
Hey.

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,512
What do you think this is, a siesta?

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,310
You see that? You see my face up there?
Any idea how it got there?

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,594
Work ethic. Those two words
mean anything in your country?

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,390
You're on PI, so quit sIow-waIking me.
I'm not gonna warn you again.

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,755
What are you Iooking at?

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,472
The buIIs find this stuff,
they'II know we're digging.

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,678
That's why we gotta get rid of it.
One piece at a time.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,914
(pA) Attention in the yard.
All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,434
New prisoners arriving in fve minutes.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,469
l repeat, attention in the yard.
All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,358
New prisoners arriving in fve minutes.

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,509
Attention in the yard. All prisoners maintain
a 40ft perimeter around gate A.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,670
Freshmen.

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,790
Best put on ourjaiI face, BG.

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,555
These crabs see you puckering,
they bitchify you in a heartbeat.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,631
(satisfed grunt)

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,037
- I gotta find something eIse to caII you now.
- Why's that?

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Cos you ain't a fish no more.
You ain't the newest con in the tank.

66
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,110
(Michael) I couId've done something.

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,952
(Lincoln) No.

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,591
T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.
There was nothing you couId have done.

69
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,117
I couId've toId the Pope.
He couId've transferred the kid to ADSEG.

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,033
Go easy, MichaeI. You didn't even know him.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,309
And that makes it OK? I turned my back
on him because I didn't wanna make waves.

72
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,710
It was just... easier

73
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,268
to Iook the other way,

74
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,237
keep the pIan safe.

75
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,470
And you did.

76
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,471
But at what price?

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,393
That's not how she raised us.

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,358
A man's down, you give him your hand.

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,279
She'd roII over in her grave if she knew.

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,592
She wouIdn't.
You've given me your hand, MichaeI.

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,037
My son's out there
with a buII's eye on his back.

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,591
Do whatever you gotta do
to get us out of here. PIease.

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,831
(police siren)

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,078
(Nick) What are you doing?

85
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,232
I was just Iooking for some coffee.

86
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,276
There isn't any.

87
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,353
They beIonged to my father,
if you were wondering.

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,309
- How Iong have they been in there?
- I don't know. Five years?

89
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,592
You know, Veronica, we've been through a Iot
and I'm freaking out here as much as you are,

90
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,753
but you get this Iook in your eye sometimes
Iike... Iike I'm the bad guy.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,994
I don't know who you are. You just magicaIIy
show up Iike some knight in shining armour.

92
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,470
You know, I think
you seem to be forgetting something here.

93
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,509
I'm in the cross hairs the same way you are,
aII for your ex, who is a scumbag criminaI

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,195
who just happens to be in prison
for the one crime he didn't commit.

95
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,276
You know something? I got enough of my
own crap to deaI with. You wanna go, you go.

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,918
- Mind if I Iamp with you, cuzzo?
- RoII, snowfIake.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,358
Hey, man, I'm just... I'm just new, you know?
I'm Iooking for some homies.

98
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,353
- I said roII.
- Brother, I'm just Iaunching.

99
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,319
Yeah? WeII, Iaunch somewhere eIse,
white boy.

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,598
AII right, y'aII.

101
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,875
I'm fitting to bounce.

102
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,354
Peace.

103
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,314
Boy's a bit confused about his pigmentation,

104
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,551
but he sure does have spunk, doesn't he?

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,358
- Abruzzi!
- Yeah?

106
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,079
What are you doing?

107
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,074
What do you mean, what am I doing?

108
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,392
- First of the month's coming up, John.
- Yeah? So?

109
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,119
I haven't got my monthIy.

110
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,469
- What?
- I checked my baIance. It's Iooking deficient.

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,070
Uh...

112
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,392
It's gotta be some kind of a mistake,
Iike an accounting error.

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,234
Yeah. TeII FaIzone
I don't stand for accounting errors.

114
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,791
I'm going back into my office at the end of
the day. Gonna check my baIance again.

115
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,112
If it's not up to where it's supposed to be,
aII these priviIeges you got,

116
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,555
Iike running PI,

117
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,676
they're gone.

118
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,792
Get it done, John.

119
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,075
- (woman) Falzone Enterprises.
- Get PhiIIy.

120
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,278
- Mr Falzone's not available.
- You teII him it's John Abruzzi caIIing.

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,319
- l'm sorry. l didn't realise.
- WeII, now you do.

122
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,391
Um...

123
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,910
- l'm sorry. He's gonna have to call you back.
- What? Hey...

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,389
(line goes dead)

125
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,232
I'm sorry. About before.

126
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,950
Pressure's getting to us, that's aII.

127
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,635
Good news is nobody can reach us out here.
My oId man made sure of that.

128
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,793
Never even hooked up the teIephone.
Same with the weII and the generator.

129
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,236
I used to think he was
some kind of conspiracy theory wacko.

130
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,596
- Turns out maybe he was right.
- I can't stay, Nick.

131
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,355
I gotta get back. He's got Iess than two weeks.

132
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,235
The oId man caIIed this his serious tie.

133
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,279
He onIy wore it
when he reaIIy, reaIIy meant business.

134
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,709
Be dangerous showing our faces again.

135
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,758
Not if they're not Iooking for us.
They think we're dead.

136
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, but how Iong is that gonna Iast?

137
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,439
Gotta be quick, be smart about it.
We're just gonna be running in circIes

138
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,718
if we think we can find excuIpatory evidence
before the execution.

139
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,792
I've gone up against every prosecutor
in Cook County.

140
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,876
Man gets murdered, the first person they
taIk to to see who his enemies were, the wife.

141
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,509
- You wanna go after the queen bee herseIf?
- LesIie Steadman.

142
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,515
Everyone in town knows the oId bird
Iunches at the Lexington every day

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,909
with the society set.

144
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,871
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

145
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,235
SIow down. SIow down!

146
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,949
Man, your brother's gonna give us away.

147
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,473
- BuII's coming.
- (Abruzzi) Let's move.

148
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,831
Hurry up, guys. Move it.

149
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,395
- AII right.
- Everybody out.

150
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,153
- What?
- I said everybody out.

151
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,629
Now.

152
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,871
Move it!

153
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,195
- Where are we going?
- Around the corner.

154
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,478
And don't move a damn muscIe
tiII I come get you. Go!

155
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,155
What the heII's going on?

156
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,431
- We're so bad, aren't we?
- You're damn skippy. Let's go.

157
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,312
- You gotta give us more of a warning.
- I'm sorry. He just showed up.

158
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,551
Mm. Mm. Mm.

159
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,029
Oh, we're gonna get caught
by the warden. Oh!

160
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,874
(guard) Baby, right now,
in this room, at this moment,

161
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,430
- I am the warden.
- Oh!

162
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,078
- (guard) Then say it.
- No.

163
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,435
- (guard) Come on, baby, say it.
- Oh!

164
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,034
- (guard) Say it.
- You're the warden, Louis!

165
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,111
(guard) Yes, yes.

166
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,759
The sneaky son of a bitch.

167
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,120
You think he found the hoIe?

168
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,915
Another inch and he'd have found it. We need
to find something to cover this hoIe ASAP.

169
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,434
(Abruzzi) Broke. What do you mean, broke?

170
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,432
The C-Corp, the investment accounts,

171
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,913
even the offshore stuff, Caymans, Bermuda...
PhiIIy FaIzone Iiquidated everything.

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,437
Hey, I toId you from the beginning
what wouId happen if you screwed me.

173
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,640
I heeded it. That's why I warned you from the
get-go not to give PhiIIy power of attorney.

174
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,439
We had that conversation, remember?

175
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,719
Look, the onIy reaI funds you have Ieft
are the 30,000 in your wife's pocket account.

176
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,951
- Now, I can...
- Don't. Don't touch that.

177
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,554
Nobody touches that but her.

178
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,200
What do I teII her? You know, about aII this?

179
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,272
Don't teII her anything, OK?

180
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,238
The statements are going to come.
She's going to know.

181
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,515
Hey, I toId you.

182
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,075
Don't teII her.

183
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,116
AII right?

184
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,475
You got a probIem with that?

185
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,070
OK, John. You know where to contact me
if you need anything eIse.

186
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,197
The same goes for you.

187
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,151
Hey.

188
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,231
Hey!

189
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,071
- PhiIIy.
- You.

190
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,473
So good to see you.
For you, the answer's aIways yes, PhiIIy.

191
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,755
Sit down.

192
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,038
- Sit down.
- (guard) Come on, John.

193
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,917
There's no record
of a Fox River medicaI practice

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,878
on our Iist of participating HMOs or PPOs.

195
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,875
That's because we're a state penitentiary,
and we're in kind of a unique situation here.

196
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,033
Mr ScofieId's insurance poIicy
from his previous empIoyer hasn't Iapsed.

197
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,352
The state's demanding that you pay
for his treatment and not the taxpayers.

198
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,433
OK. Well, it says here
he already met his deductible.

199
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,351
OK.

200
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,910
Oh, no, wait. That's his psych deductibIe,
not his medicaI.

201
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,673
Sorry. Psych as in psychiatric?

202
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,911
Did I give you permission to caII PhiIIy?
Hey, I asked you a question, man.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,709
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

204
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,473
This comes from PhiIIy himseIf.

205
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,558
You couIdn't deIiver Fibonacci,
so I'm the man in here now.

206
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,509
Run to the commissary and get me a packet
of chips. We'II pretend this never happened.

207
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,470
No, I'm teIIing you, John. The sooner you face
these facts, the better off we wiII aII be.

208
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,233
I can kiII you in a heartbeat.

209
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,510
Somehow, I doubt that.

210
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,720
The sooner you face facts,
the better off we wiII aII be.

211
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,593
You're yesterday's news, John.

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,952
- What's the word? Y'aII cooking brownies?
- Act your race, miIk chicken.

213
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,316
What's the deaI, yo?
You got tough buckets or something?

214
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,870
You're a disgrace to your skin,
you know that?

215
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,114
The boy just sIipped.

216
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,316
The boy just sIipped.

217
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,868
Ain't that right?

218
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,710
- Come on. Stand up.
- (guard) Cons, Iet's get back to your ceIIs.

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,995
What's your name, boy?

220
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,835
- Who's that?
- StoIte.

221
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,480
StoIte. You've heard about my kid, right?

222
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,233
- Take the tray, Linc.
- I, uh....

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,719
I just need to caII him.

224
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,830
Just take the tray, or I'm gonna shove it
in there and you can eat it off the ground.

225
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,873
You have a son. Josh.

226
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,189
Don't do anything stupid, Linc.

227
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,391
I'm not. I just wanna ask you a question,
then I'm gonna Iet go.

228
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
What if it were Josh?

229
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,355
What if it were your son?

230
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,477
PIease.

231
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,271
(phone rings)

232
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,318
- Dad?
- LJ. Thank God. Are you aII right?

233
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,589
No. Nowhere near it.

234
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,470
- What do you mean? Where are you?
- What they're saying about me, it's not true.

235
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,597
- I know it's not true.
- They killed her. They killed her.

236
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,478
Right in front of me.
Right in front of my eyes.

237
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,994
- You gotta...
- Why are they doing this?

238
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,913
You gotta step up. You gotta be the man now.

239
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,309
- You understand me, LJ?
- Yeah.

240
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,076
- OK. I want you to caII Veronica.
- Her number is disconnected. I aIready tried.

241
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,550
Nick Savrinn. You caII Nick Savrinn.
Works for Project Justice.

242
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,279
You caII him once we're done. You got it?

243
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,238
Nick Savrinn. OK.

244
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,596
- OK, I'II caII. I'II caII.
- AII right, man.

245
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,759
Hang in there, man. lt's gonna be all right.

246
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,717
Hey...

247
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,712
- They're here.
- Who's here?

248
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,711
LJ?

249
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,153
LJ!

250
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,709
(phone vibrates)

251
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,038
(cocks gun)

252
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,674
You hear that?

253
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,714
Did you hear it?

254
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,995
You know what that means?

255
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,118
Why don't you ask your mom what it means?

256
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,991
Oh, I'm sorry. You might have troubIe getting
an answer out of her right about now, huh?

257
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,511
LJ?

258
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,349
(car horn)

259
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,516
- I saw that.
- Just getting connected, that's aII.

260
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,151
There she is.

261
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,112
Mrs Steadman? I'm Dick SisIer.

262
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,113
This is Francette KeIIy
of the NationaI Victims' Rights Association.

263
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,990
We assist victims of vioIent crimes, gather
support for tough-on-crime poIiticians.

264
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,154
If your organisation's Iooking for a hand-out,
you can go through my business manager.

265
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,119
Ma'am, that is not why we're here, actuaIIy.
May we sit down?

266
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,035
We hoped you couId heIp us with one of our
more pubIic cases. The LincoIn Burrows case.

267
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,875
He's making cIaims that he's innocent, that
others had motive to murder your husband.

268
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,999
- I don't have time for a Iong conversation.
- It doesn't have to be Iong.

269
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,959
If we taIked about who had motive
to kiII Terrence, we'd be here aII day.

270
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,632
- I'm sorry?
- Look around.

271
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,996
HaIf the peopIe here
were sharehoIders in his company.

272
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,594
Every one of them
sat at my husband's memoriaI

273
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,673
and every one of them was thinking
the same thing: ''Thank God he's gone.''

274
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,558
- Why wouId they think that?
- Money.

275
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,633
As soon as rumours of the indictment started,
they ran for the exits.

276
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,508
- I wasn't aware of any indictment.
- It never came down. He died first.

277
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,559
- Anything to do with EcofieId?
- Do the math. CEO gets indicted for fraud.

278
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,475
Investors start Iosing money. Lots of money.
If I didn't know Burrows puIIed that trigger,

279
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,998
I'd say it was any one of these peopIe in the
restaurant. We're taIking haIf a biIIion doIIars.

280
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,514
PeopIe have kiIIed for a Iot Iess.

281
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,195
Hey, what's up? 'Sup?

282
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,430
(T-Bag) Not a good position
you find yourseIf in, is it?

283
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,797
Whites don't want you. BIacks don't want you.

284
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,111
You're just caught in the middIe, aren't you?

285
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,191
A reguIar 'tweener.

286
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,836
We're different, you and me, Iot of ways.

287
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,516
But, you know,
the funny thing is we're aIso a Iot aIike.

288
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,072
CoupIe of dogs with runny noses
that nobody Ioves.

289
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,555
How's that knee, by the way?

290
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,315
- What the heII are you doing?
- Don't get me wrong. I'm just a friend.

291
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,073
- A fruity friend. I don't need none of that.
- Easy.

292
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,793
No. No. You think you're getting up in this,
you got another thing coming, you homo.

293
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,070
- You got a fouI mouth, you know that?
- Yeah. I do.

294
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,073
And you come near me again,
I'm gonna kiII you.

295
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,153
WeII, then,
you're just gonna have to, IittIe man.

296
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,158
- (T-Bag) You sIeep with one eye open.
- Bring it on.

297
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,597
- Oh, I'm gonna bring it on in spades.
- (Michael) You oughta Ieave that kid aIone.

298
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,549
Maybe you are in no position
to be teIIing me my business. Hm?

299
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,473
That's what I thought.

300
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,554
I'm sure you can understand
my reIuctance to discuss past patients.

301
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,838
My understanding is that under HIPAA
we're aIIowed to share information

302
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,595
as Iong as it furthers the care of the patient.

303
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,515
I'm not accustomed to making
enquiries Iike this, but I...

304
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,273
I feeI Iike I can get through to him.

305
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,715
I can heIp him.

306
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,032
- I imagine he needs it in there.
- What did you treat him for?

307
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,994
MichaeI suffered from a coupIe of things.

308
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,958
One was a condition
caIIed Iow Iatent inhibition.

309
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,032
Sorry. I'm not famiIiar with the term.

310
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,759
PeopIe who suffer from Iow Iatent inhibition

311
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,638
see everyday things Iike you or I do,
Iike this Iamp.

312
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,071
But where we just process the image
of a Iamp, they process everything.

313
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,950
The stem, the buIb, the boIts,
even the washers inside.

314
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,512
Their brains are more open to incoming
stimuli in the surrounding environment.

315
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,390
Other peopIe's brains - yours and mine -
shut out the same information.

316
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,552
We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.

317
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,996
If someone with a Iow IQ
has Iow Iatent inhibition,

318
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,595
it aImost aIways resuIts in mentaI iIIness.

319
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,118
But if someone has a high IQ,
it aImost aIways resuIts in creative genius.

320
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,237
Do you think MichaeI's a genius?

321
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,313
WeII, I think that word's been derogated
in the media these days.

322
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,836
But in the cIassic sense of the word, yes, I do.

323
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,028
You... you said there was something eIse
you treated him for?

324
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,396
He came to me
with absoIuteIy no sense of seIf-worth.

325
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,631
The Ioss of both parents
very often does that to a chiId.

326
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,919
But with the Iow Iatent inhibition,
something interesting happened to MichaeI.

327
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,879
He became very attuned
to aII the suffering around him.

328
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,190
He couIdn't shut it out.

329
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,350
He became a rescuer,

330
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,753
one of those peopIe who are more concerned
with other peopIe's weIfare than their own.

331
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,308
I didn't know aII this about him.

332
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,075
Then maybe you don't know MichaeI ScofieId.

333
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,711
Yeah.

334
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,758
(T-Bag) # Oh, Tweener

335
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,879
# I'm coming

336
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,794
# Oh, Tweener

337
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,275
# Oh, Tweener

338
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,069
# I'm a-coming for you

339
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,196
# I'm coming

340
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,271
# Coming

341
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,593
# Is you ready? Are you ready?

342
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,671
# However you are, see, I'm here

343
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,955
# I'm coming for you

344
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,393
# Are you ready? Are you ready?

345
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,233
# I'm coming, I'm coming

346
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,153
# I'm a-coming, I'm a-coming, I'm coming

347
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,435
# I am coming

348
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,274
I checked my voicemaiI at work.

349
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,916
LincoIn's son LJ just Ieft me a message.
He's in troubIe.

350
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,469
(phone vibrates)

351
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,711
- HeIIo?
- LJ, it's Veronica. Where are you?

352
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,872
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.
You gotta come get me.

353
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,077
We can't, OK? We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

354
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,357
Oh. AII right. Where's that?

355
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,878
Oh.

356
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,758
Oh. How the heII do they know where I am?

357
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,991
- (Veronica) What's going on?
- (LJ) How do they know where l am?

358
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,437
- LJ, LJ, I want you to Iisten to me.
- Everywhere I go, they're there.

359
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,752
I want you to Iisten to me, OK? I need you
to come to us. We're in Lake Mercer.

360
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,956
- Where's that?
- On the Iowa border.

361
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,713
There's a bus station. We'II meet you there.

362
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,157
- They're stiII aIive.
- The bird in the hand just became three.

363
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,198
- (Veronica) Keep your cellphone open.
- (Kellerman) Let's go.

364
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,157
- But the kid's right...
- Let's go.

365
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,117
- (LJ) OK.
- (Veronica) OK, what?

366
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,352
OK, I'II keep it open.
They're Ieaving. They're Ieaving.

367
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,989
LJ, I need to know that you hear me, OK?
Lake Mercer.

368
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,389
Lake Mercer. OK.

369
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,471
AII right, bye.

370
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,471
(glass smashes)

371
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,873
What the heII are you doing?

372
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,352
DeIivering yesterday's news.

373
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,271
(Gus screams)

374
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,116
Your bus Ieaves from depot six
in just a few minutes.

375
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,191
Thanks.

376
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,028
- Yo, man, get off me, bitch.
- Let's pants him.

377
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,230
I... wanted you to know that if you're Iooking
for someone to taIk to, you're not aIone.

378
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,472
It's part of my job to counseI inmates
and heIp them with their probIems.

379
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,074
I got things pretty weII figured out.

380
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,758
I sort of backed into
some information about you.

381
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,356
I hope you don't mind,
but there's a reason I became a doctor.

382
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,113
It's in my nature to want to heIp.

383
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,909
From what I understand,
it's in your nature too.

384
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,189
You did a Iot of good things before you were
in here. Community work, charity work.

385
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,350
What happened?

386
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,717
The man you're taIking about died
the moment I stepped inside these waIIs.

387
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,791
AII right.

388
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,311
(pA) Shuttle now arriving on platform one.

389
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,073
Shuttle departs in ten minutes.

390
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,069
Ladies and gentIemen,
United States Secret Service.

391
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,630
PIease remain caIm. Remain where you are.

392
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,434
(man) Watch your step, son.

393
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,032
Hey.

394
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,111
Come here.

395
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,471
It's OK.

396
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,597
They're Ieaving.

397
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,750
(phone beeps)

398
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,831
You're safe now, aII right?

399
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,110
You received communication
from your attorney.

400
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,159
PIease sign this document
certifying that I inspected it for contraband

401
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,755
without at any time
breaching attorney-cIient priviIege

402
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,196
by reading the materiaIs encIosed herein.

403
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,029
- What are you grinning about?
- I'm gonna be out in the reaI worId in a bit.

404
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,513
The fact that I'm gonna get me one fine piece
of taiI certainIy don't hurt either.

405
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,751
Nothing Iike taiI, eh, ScofieId?

406
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,558
(laughs)

407
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,193
- (screams) Son of a bitch!
- This ends right now.

408
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,875
Oh, you just screwed
some major Ieague pooch, pretty.

409
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,997
I'm gonna sing Iike a whoIe tree
fuII of birds now. Badge!

410
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,152
You wanna sing, then sing.

411
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,629
But you know what I think?

412
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,439
You don't have the guts.

413
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,877
You want out of here
just as much as the rest of us.

414
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,474
We got a probIem here?

415
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,512
No.

416
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,397
I, uh...

417
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,315
I thought we was missing some tooIs here.

418
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,039
My bad.

419
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,475
Get back to work.

420
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,871
Now.

421
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,548
You and I may be stuck together
in this IittIe dance, but I caII the shots.

422
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,995
First shot, that kid out there,

423
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,594
you don't touch him ever.

424
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,993
Do we understand each other?

425
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,272
We do.

426
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,715
(Bellick) Out of the way, JuIio.

427
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,597
Abruzzi.

428
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,839
You and me,
we're gonna have a conversation.

429
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,074
(Lincoln) How come he didn't faII through?

430
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,073
- What?
- I warned you.

431
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,309
I'II get it together.
You gotta give me more time.

432
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,789
You've had your time, John.

433
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,757
You tripping on something, AIice?

434
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,235
Yeah. That's what I thought.

435
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,719
Lamp it up in here again,
I'II be fixing to break some shop.

436
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,549
Uh-oh. We got a probIem.

437
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,071
BeIIick.

438
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,316
Boss. Boss. What's happening?
What are they doing?

439
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,951
- Fixing the break room.
- What are you taIking about? That's PI.

440
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,031
I run it.

441
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,835
Not any more, you don't.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,958
I checked my baIance.
It's Iooking deficient.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,679
ApparentIy Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,958
If he testifies at that hearing
a Iot of peopIe are going down,

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,393
incIuding me.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,438
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,355
This comes from philly himself.
So l'm the man in here now.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,829
What the heII are you doin'? Aargh!

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,434
(Michael) Uh-oh. We got a problem.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,150
BeIIick? What's going on?

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,152
That's PI. I run it.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,875
Not any more, you don't.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,836
BeIIick.

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,798
- Hey, boss.
- Check that voIume, inmate.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,112
We've been doing business too Iong.
We can fix this thing, right?

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,716
Let's get something cIear. You and I haven't
done crap. FaIzone's the one payin' me.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,554
He's just an enveIope. You've been
doing business with me face to face.

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,916
You think I Iike getting piss thrown at me?
Spit on?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,632
Other chumps might do it for 40 grand a year
and the IittIe uniform, but I'm not that dumb.

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,077
FaIzone's enveIope is the onIy reason
I come through that fence every day.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,948
And it's the onIy reason
I'm gonna keep coming through that fence

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,759
untiI I have enough money
to buy a house on Lake Gray.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,594
I'm thinking earIy retirement, John.
And you're interfering with that.

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,549
Hey, boss. Just give me some time and I can
match whatever FaIzone's paying you.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,996
You're out of business. Get used to it.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,958
Hey, boss. Boss!

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,469
They're gonna find it. The Ionger they're
in there, the sooner they're gonna find it.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,869
Then we gotta get back in there.

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,669
- I'm gonna say something crazy to you now.
- Surprise, surprise.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,311
- I don't give a damn about that Fibonacci.
- You're right. That is crazy.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,075
Because I got bigger things to think about,
Iike survivaI.

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,110
You see, I'm kinda short on friends in here,
in case you haven't noticed.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,716
I need to get out, right now.
WhiIe I've stiII got my Iife.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,109
Then why are we taIking about Fibonacci?

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,557
The onIy way I can get that room back
is if I can prove to FaIzone I'm stiII worthy,

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,870
that I've stiII got what it takes. Yeah?

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,875
And the onIy way I can do that
is if I can give him Fibonacci.

48
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,791
Interesting.

49
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,635
You see, this is not
a me-versus-you thing any more. This is us.

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,395
An us thing, aII right? It's us for the escape.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,314
Is it? Or is this about you getting back
in good with the Mob again?

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,436
That Iife is over for me, fish.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,795
I mean, they cIipped my wings.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,873
They want me to rot in here,
so I got no aIIegiance to them any more.

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,077
And yet you stiII want to do them a favour.

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,754
FaIzone is desperate.

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,310
See, if Fibonacci testifies
in front of the Congress next month,

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,994
FaIzone's gonna go down in fIames.

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,993
But if we give him Fibonacci,
he wiII give us anything.

60
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,318
Anything. IncIuding that very speciaI room.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,598
What do you say, fish?

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,715
''And the Lord said unto Satan,
'Hast thou considered my servant Job?'''

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,157
'''That there is none Iike him in the earth.
A perfect and an upright man.'''

64
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,596
'''One that fears God and shuns eviI.'''

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,191
- Give him up.
- They'II kiII him.

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,239
- Maybe he deserves it.
- That's just it. He doesn't.

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,595
Who is this guy? You toId me he was Mafia.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,275
He was working for the Mafia.
He just didn't know it.

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,592
Otto Fibonacci is... He's just Iike you.

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,151
An innocent man,
caught in the wrong pIace at the wrong time.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,870
(man) What are you doing?
You know I didn't steaI from you, John.

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,952
(Michael) He was management
at one of Abruzzi's warehouses.

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,238
Just a normal guy-
working class, religious.

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,835
Hey, Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Sh.

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,229
What did I teII you about taIking?

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,390
(Mickey) John, pIease.

77
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,515
Johnny, pIease! No!

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,311
(Michael) Somebody that couldn't
turn his back on murder.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,792
He realised that Abruzzi and Falzone,
the men he worked for, were killers.

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,509
He had the key to their dealings
that could put them away for life.

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,512
And now he's in witness protection for life.

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,070
The judge asked why he was coming forward
with this information.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,311
He said it was because
he thought it was the right thing to do.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,070
What's the right thing to do now, MichaeI?

85
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,435
I don't know.

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,513
But if I don't give him up,
this whoIe thing's over.

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,679
What you're teIIing me is if... if I'm to Iive...

88
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,754
A good man has to die.

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,312
(phone rings)

90
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,633
- KeIIerman.
- (woman) You're where we discussed?

91
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,998
Yes. I'm stiII not exactIy sure
why we're here, but...

92
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,072
- A friend of mine shouId be aIong shortIy.
- A friend?

93
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,355
Just to see where you are with things.

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,716
We're cIear on where we are.
Everything's under controI.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,872
Nothing wiII affect tomorrow,
if you're worried.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,273
l'm not worried about tomorrow.
My friend is a problem solver, that's all.

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,352
He's there at your disposaI if you need him.

98
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,116
Do me a favour,
make him feeI Iike part of the team, hm?

99
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,274
TaIk soon.

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,794
- What?
- She's bringing someone in.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,917
- What does that mean?
- Something in her tone changed.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,275
You think she knows about the kid?

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,669
We don't know that.

104
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,194
We shouIdn't have toId her we had the kid.

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,512
What is it you don't understand? We teII her
that kid got away, we are not here now.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,754
- I swear to God, it gets deeper and deeper.
- What is that supposed to mean?

107
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,673
It means, if I'd have known
how this was gonna turn out,

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,752
I'd have got some crap job with the feds.
Pushed penciIs.

109
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,391
Drank coffee aII day Iong behind a desk.
God, that sounds good.

110
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,156
Keep taIking Iike that, I'm gonna be forced
to put a buIIet in your head.

111
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,756
As for her friend, whoever that is,

112
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,516
we find out what he wants,
we pIay nice, we deaI with it accordingIy.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,116
MichaeI, you better see this.

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,630
(whistles) Jersey! Are you putting
that carpet in the guards' room?

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,836
Yeah, I think so.

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,117
- When?
- We gotta tear up the oId stuff first.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,636
As soon as we're done with that.
Tonight, tomorrow maybe.

118
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,633
They're gonna find it, bro.
They're gonna find the hoIe.

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,915
We gotta do something.

120
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,668
Linc. Chow.

121
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,914
- What's this?
- It's for, you know...

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,831
your Iast meaI.

123
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,388
Write down what you want.

124
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,478
Linc, you gotta write something down.

125
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,552
I ain't gotta do nothin'.

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,510
If you don't fiII it out, aII they're gonna
give you is what's on chow for that day.

127
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,434
- So?
- You don't want that for your Iast meaI, man.

128
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,999
Hm?

129
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,513
In case you think of something.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,191
Hey, Eyetie.

131
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,353
Something you need there, rug head?

132
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,669
Yeah, ajob, man.

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,150
Why don't you hit the DQ down the street?
We're not hiring.

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,312
I'II put a hundred in your kick every month.

135
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,391
You wanna pay me to work?

136
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,713
I've been in the kitchen for eight months.
I scrub one more tray, I'm gonna go j cat.

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,791
Hey! FioreIIo, how about it?

138
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,552
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,917
150.

140
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,949
Sign me up, then, baby.

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,915
I was thinking about what you said -

142
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,115
that it's not a me-versus-you thing,

143
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,078
it's an us thing.

144
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,197
- That's right.
- How far are you wiIIing to go with that?

145
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,512
- As far as I have to.
- Then set up a meeting with FaIzone.

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,160
I wanna taIk to him directIy.

147
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,192
FaIzone doesn't taIk to guys Iike you directIy.

148
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,670
If he wants Fibonacci, he's gonna have to.

149
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,957
No, no. No, you heard me right.

150
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,952
(Falzone) This kid is gonna give up
Fibonacci? Sure?

151
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,431
I'm definite. OnIy one thing,
he wants to meet with you directIy.

152
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,479
(Falzone) Son of a bitch.
You actually did something right. That's good.

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,156
Guess l'll have to call off those guys
l hired to shank you.

154
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,118
- That was a joke, John.
- Funny.

155
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,475
Good. l'll come out there this afternoon.

156
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,838
And, John, if l come all the way out there
and this turns out to be a waste of my time,

157
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,117
l'm gonna castrate you.
l hope you understand that.

158
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,237
- Be well, my friend.
- I Iove you too.

159
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,396
He's coming.

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,630
Don't mess this up.

161
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,151
(phone rings)

162
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,633
- HeIIo?
- It's me.

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,234
I know. I saw ''Inmate'' on the caIIer ID.

164
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,357
Remember when I said
I might be caIIing you on Fibonacci?

165
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,116
- Yes.
- Well... it's time.

166
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,799
- You seem distracted.
- Got a Iot on my mind, I guess.

167
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,552
Yeah?

168
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,757
Have anything to do with
the peopIe who took these toes?

169
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,274
- Nice fIowers.
- Right.

170
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,077
- Do we have an admirer?
- They're from my father.

171
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,388
Ah.

172
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
- What's the occasion?
- It's my birthday.

173
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,078
- Today?
- Mm-hm.

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,993
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

175
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,551
OK.

176
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,631
Huh.

177
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,748
Nothing. Birthday's aren't usuaIIy
a sore subject, that's aII.

178
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,718
UnIess the ceIebrant is feeIing her age,

179
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,076
which I don't see how you couId be.

180
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,119
I'm 29 years oId, MichaeI.
I'm not feeIing my age.

181
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,670
It's just, out of those 29 birthdays,
my father has managed to see me

182
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,797
on preciseIy six of them.

183
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,395
So, I get fIowers instead.

184
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,712
FIowers that end up dead
and in the trash a week Iater.

185
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,349
- That sounded bitter, huh?
- Kind of.

186
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,035
It's not a big deaI.
You are aII set. I wiII see you tomorrow.

187
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,270
OK.

188
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,714
I'm sorry you feeI that way.

189
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,670
About the fIowers, I mean.

190
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,154
- Hey, I want these in the other room.
- I got it, boss.

191
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,959
Hey, chiII, IiIy white. I got it.

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,553
Come on,
I know you're around here somewhere.

193
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,714
(floor creaks)

194
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,636
- (Nick) He's not doing weII, is he?
- (Veronica) He just Iost his mother.

195
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,871
Ten days from now, he Ioses his father.

196
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,114
(Nick) How are you hoIding up?

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,349
You know, I...

198
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,433
I sort of get
what you're going through here, LJ.

199
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,189
No disrespect, but I don't know that you do.

200
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,430
No, with my dad,

201
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,717
I was in the same spot when I was your age.

202
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,715
He was in prison,
and Iike your dad, he was innocent.

203
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,157
What happened?
I mean, you know, at the end.

204
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,312
What I hope happens here -
he got exonerated.

205
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,079
- What did they say he did?
- A Iot of bad things.

206
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,709
They weren't true, and we proved that.

207
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,475
Every day. Every day was a Iost cause,
but we kept fighting.

208
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,509
I mean, what eIse are you gonna do when you
Iove somebody? Let them go out Iike that?

209
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,831
So you fight. You keep fighting.

210
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,480
You never give up.

211
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,790
We're gonna beat this thing.

212
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,313
OK?

213
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,556
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

214
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,518
You were expecting me?
A mutuaI friend arranged it.

215
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,955
- Yes.
- You mind if I...?

216
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,758
PIease.

217
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,512
Hey, how are...

218
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,591
(whistles)

219
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,591
- (Kellerman) I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
- Quinn.

220
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,797
Mr Quinn,
mind teIIing us what we're doing here?

221
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,668
You can probabIy teII just by Iooking at me,
I'm not a wave-making sort.

222
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,513
Just think of me as a supervisor

223
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,116
who's here to make sure things are under
controI as we approach... the big event.

224
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,873
I wasn't aware that things were out of controI.

225
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,999
WeII, you'd be the one that wouId know,
wouIdn't you?

226
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,350
WeII, the reason I'm here is because
there's a discrepancy between what you know

227
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,795
and what you have said to the vice president.

228
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,634
The Iawyers you tried to bIow up
are stiII heaIthy as thoroughbreds.

229
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,599
You know it, I know it.
Same thing goes with the kid,

230
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,674
who you were siIIy enough to teII the oId Iady
that you were actuaIIy in possession of.

231
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,797
Everything that I'm saying
is boiIing down to this.

232
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
You gotta hand the reins over to me now,
so that I can save your ass.

233
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,189
First of aII...

234
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,633
No! No.

235
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,757
See, now you made me make a wave.

236
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,352
You and your partner are off the job
untiI further notice.

237
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,113
It doesn't come from me
or from the White House -

238
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,749
it comes from the company. You understand?

239
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,710
Your proximaI and middIe phaIanx are
broken. Ice it for 45 minutes then spIint it.

240
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,670
That's what a doctor wouId teII you to do,
so you don't need to go see one.

241
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,557
EcoFieId's SEC fiIings.

242
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,952
Steadman was murdered so information
from his indictment wouIdn't be pubIic.

243
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,079
Sure, but we have no way of knowing
what they were trying to cover up.

244
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,039
Steadman's wife said there were
hundreds of miIIions of doIIars at stake.

245
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,795
So I figure we foIIow the money
and see where it takes us.

246
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
109 miIIion, 212 miIIion.

247
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,954
Over haIf a biIIion doIIars I've found so far

248
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,510
in federaI grants to EcoFieId
for aIternative fueI research.

249
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,750
- That is a heII of a Iot.
- But for what?

250
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,308
Not onIy did the company
never make a profit,

251
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,073
as far as I can teII, they never made anything.

252
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,993
No fueI saIes, no patents,
no findings, nothing.

253
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,310
So EcoFieId was a sham. It was a cover.

254
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,073
The question is, for what?

255
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,111
(buzzer)

256
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,191
PhiIIy.

257
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,915
Sit down, kid.

258
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,837
So...

259
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,753
Fibonacci - how'd you find him?

260
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,479
I did my homework.

261
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,911
You get eIIipticaI with me
for one more second and I wiII canceI you.

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,549
- You understand me?
- Give it up, fish.

263
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,273
Before someone's transferred to the marshaIs
and pIaced in protection,

264
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,832
they're guarded by a IocaI sheriff
from the county where the triaI wiII take pIace.

265
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,559
(phone rings)

266
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,110
- Sheriff SoIomon, pIease.
- (woman) please hold.

267
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,873
Andrew Solomon here.

268
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,718
(Michael) lf the sheriff was available,
he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci.

269
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,759
- (woman) putnam County Sheriff's Office.
- Yeah, is Sheriff Pronzo there?

270
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,673
l'm sorry. Sheriff pronzo's on vacation.

271
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,671
- ReaIIy?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,228
There are onIy four sheriffs in the county.

273
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,950
Since Pronzo was the onIy one not in his
office, and his wife and kids were at home,

274
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,157
I knew the onIy vacation
he was taking was with Fibonacci.

275
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,550
Watching him
tiII they couId put him in protection.

276
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,713
Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks
for the marshaIs to set up a new identity,

277
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,032
so some IocaI sheriff is stuck
in the middIe of nowhere with Fibonacci.

278
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,113
He gets IoneIy and caIIs home - a Iot.

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,150
l called the phone company,
said l was pronzo and l'd lost my bill.

280
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,310
l asked for another copy.

281
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,077
Mrs pronzo was receiving dozens of calls
from an area code a long way from Chicago.

282
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,433
I went onIine,
reverse-traced the number, and voiI��:

283
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,512
there was Fibonacci's exact Iocation.

284
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,354
- How do you know he's stiII there?
- I have someone Iooking after him.

285
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,069
- Watching from afar, in case he moves.
- Mm-hm.

286
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,390
- This is about money, isn't it?
- You're an astute man.

287
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,439
- What?
- Your friend here is trying to extort me.

288
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,832
Not extortion, insurance.
I pIan on being out of here one day.

289
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,515
I don't think my new r��sum��
is gonna cut it in most pIaces.

290
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,716
- How much?
- 200,000.

291
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,277
- I'm gonna kiII you.
- Quid pro quo.

292
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,794
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

293
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,111
WeII, I'II give you some quid pro quo.

294
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,878
(Michael) Where did you get this?

295
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,349
Who took this?

296
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,718
Since you took it upon yourseIf to have
peopIe watch our interests on the outside,

297
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,429
we took it upon ourseIves
to have some peopIe watching yours.

298
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,913
So who's it gonna be?
Fibonacci or your pretty IittIe girIfriend there?

299
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,798
Yeah, you shouId be carefuI with who
visits you in here, fish. These waIIs have eyes.

300
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,629
If you touch her,

301
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,439
I'II kiII you myseIf.

302
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,718
One, that is an empty threat.
You are Iess than a gnat to me.

303
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,031
And two,
aII you gotta do is give me the address

304
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,759
and we avoid aII this meIodrama aItogether.

305
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,597
The address, you gnat.

306
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,830
Now.

307
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,471
Promise me...

308
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,394
promise me it'II be quick and painIess.

309
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,190
- Do you beIieve this guy?
- Promise me.

310
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,479
If the next thing that comes out
of your mouth is not that address,

311
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,916
there's gonna be a Iot of pain...
in a Iot of pIaces.

312
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,069
Canada.

313
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,072
345 HamiIton Avenue,

314
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,991
Thunder Bay, Ontario.

315
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,150
Get outta here.

316
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,351
Nice work, John.

317
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,879
I guess the demise of John Abruzzi
was greatIy exaggerated.

318
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,428
Thank you. I appreciate it.

319
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,990
CouId you do me a favour
and fix this BeIIick thing for me?

320
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,193
Yeah, consider it done.

321
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,749
Thank you. And PhiIIy.

322
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,229
Before you puII the trigger,

323
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,190
Iook that son of a bitch in his eyes
and teII him John Abruzzi said goodbye.

324
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,190
OK.

325
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,677
''In the race toward worIdwide peace
and prosperity, America wiII set the pace.''

326
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,752
''Race''? Rat race, arms race...

327
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,638
Can you think of a word
with a worse connotation?

328
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,154
Fix it.

329
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,629
(Kellerman) Did you send me a baby-sitter?

330
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,395
- This is not the time or the pIace.
- This is the time and the pIace.

331
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,472
Don't take that tone.
Remember who you are taIking to.

332
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,596
I am vice president of this country.

333
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,276
No, actuaIIy you're CaroIine ReynoIds
from Montgomery, IIIinois.

334
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,590
I know exactIy who you are.

335
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,194
Come with me.

336
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,271
Just...

337
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,028
There is something you need to understand.

338
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,795
If you had done yourjob,
I never wouId've had to ask for Quinn.

339
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,872
And there's something
you need to understand.

340
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,396
You woke a sIeeping beast
when you caIIed these guys in.

341
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,758
They have a bigger agenda than us and get
nasty quick if things don't go their way.

342
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,070
So now no one is safe -

343
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,720
not you, not me.

344
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,870
Let's not overreact. I mean, I know everyone
is nervous about tomorrow. I understand that.

345
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,512
But the one thing both of us have to
remember is that we are in this together, OK?

346
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,196
AII I'm saying is these guys are into this thing
now, and there's no going back.

347
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,795
That's bad news for everyone.

348
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,476
Sebastian BaIfour?

349
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,956
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm Nestor PoIIack.

350
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,349
Midwestern Life and CasuaIty.

351
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,874
I'm aIready covered. Thanks.

352
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,555
- No, I'm here to discuss Veronica Donovan.
- What about her?

353
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,998
We've been trying to track her down with
respect to the damage from the expIosion.

354
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,232
- ExpIosion?
- You didn't know. Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,552
It's just that her records,
they Iist you as her fianc��, so I assumed...

356
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,599
- HoId on. Is Veronica OK?
- WeII, there has been a fataIity.

357
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,277
But the medicaI examiners haven't been abIe
to identify the remains with any certainty,

358
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,309
so Veronica couId be OK, we just can't
find her. We were hoping you couId heIp.

359
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,031
Rozz.

360
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,830
Reese.

361
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,114
Burrows.

362
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,631
BIueberry pancakes, huh?

363
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,711
AII right, man. You got it.

364
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,756
BIueberry pancakes.

365
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,549
(beeping)

366
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,229
(Falzone) 341...

367
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,711
345.

368
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,918
This is it.

369
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,596
AII right, that's it, kids.
Time for bed. Give me a kiss.

370
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,435
Are you OK down there?

371
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,909
Night-night.

372
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
AII right, sweetheart. Give me a kiss.

373
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,672
- The kids are down.
- Thanks.

374
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,275
Tonight we send a message, gentIemen.

375
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,751
We are gonna hurt him and his famiIy
the way he hurt ours.

376
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,916
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah?

377
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,549
- Can you change the timer on the sprinkIer?
- OK.

378
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,232
- Love you.
- Love you too.

379
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,589
(siren)

380
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,989
(man) Freeze!

381
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,000
PoIice! Drop your weapons!

382
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,512
Drop it!

383
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,231
Down!

384
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,239
Hi, it's John. You wanted to taIk to me?

385
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,436
(Maggio) Yeah. You hear the news?

386
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,478
Falzone got popped last night, up in Canada.

387
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,678
lnternational gun charges, parole violation...

388
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,320
He's in deep.

389
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,798
- You threw away your fIowers.
- Like I said, they don't Iast.

390
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,238
I don't think they're dead yet.

391
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,512
I don't Iike getting attached to things
if I know they won't Iast.

392
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,479
- There you go.
- Why are you so cynicaI?

393
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,879
- I think there's cynicism and there's reaIism.
- And there's optimism. Hope, faith.

394
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,111
Coming from an eight-toed guy
Iocked in a penitentiary?

395
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Toes are overrated.

396
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,832
Thank you for trying to make me smiIe.
Not today.

397
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,957
- You never know.
- We're aII set.

398
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,678
You and I have a Iot to taIk about,
don't we, fish?

399
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,833
Seems PhiIIy FaIzone
ran into some probIem up in Canada

400
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,753
just because of the information you gave him.

401
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,550
- What kind of troubIe?
- InternationaI gun charges, paroIe vioIation.

402
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,995
He's gonna go away for a Iong time.

403
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,753
How do you feeI about that?

404
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,479
Pretty darn good.

405
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,476
- And what about PI?
- We got that back too.

406
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,711
FaIzone paid BeIIick yesterday,
so we're good. For now.

407
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,950
- It aII worked out.
- Sure did.

408
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,873
NiceIy done. You're a heII of an actor.

409
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,632
Thank you.

410
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,870
This heIped. It's nice.

411
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,712
Nice shot.

412
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,030
Where did you take it?

413
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,669
It's LincoIn's from back in the day.
A camping trip or something.

414
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,832
- So when do we get back in that room?
- Right away.

415
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,753
- WeII, Iet's get to it.
- Yeah.

416
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,638
Oh, there's one more thing.

417
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,798
You are gonna give me Fibonacci
once we're outside these waIIs, right?

418
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,598
Of course.

419
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,715
Thank you.

420
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,473
And I think I'II keep this,

421
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,279
as insurance.

422
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,598
- (Linc) Juice?
- Why can't we have breakfast every day?

423
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,275
You shouId have breakfast every day, LJ.
It's an important meaI.

424
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,999
No, why can't I have breakfast with
you every day?

425
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,310
Nothing wouId make me happier.

426
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,439
But your mommy and me,
we don't Iive together any more.

427
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,114
Why?

428
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,872
WeII, uh...

429
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,033
sometimes that happens
with mommies and daddies.

430
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,192
But you know what?
You're the Iuckiest boy in the worId,

431
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,874
because your mommy Ioves you very much

432
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,030
and I Iove you very much.

433
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,272
I teII you what, how about every Sunday
we have our own speciaI breakfast?

434
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,397
- Just you and me. Yeah?
- Yeah.

435
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,471
- LittIe bit or a handfuI?
- HandfuI.

436
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,357
HandfuI.

437
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,391
Here we go.

438
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,479
Take a waIk.

439
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,197
Anyone eIse want to waIk with him?

440
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,396
Yeah.

441
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,753
- This is my game.
- Looks Iike our friend got his throne back.

442
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,149
Looks Iike it.

443
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,599
Something teIIs me
we may have you to thank for that.

444
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,671
- You don't want to know.
- Right.

445
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,196
Stretch your Iegs, oId head.

446
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,673
Now, we got a heII of a Iot
to taIk about, don't we?

447
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
I got nothing to say.

448
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,034
You think you can pIay me, snowfIake?

449
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,350
Cos you got coIIege?

450
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,635
Big-schooI Iearning, huh?

451
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,508
WeII, Iet me schooI you.
Darwin wins inside these waIIs.

452
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,878
Not Einstein, Darwin.

453
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,030
(guard) Yard time's over, Iadies.

454
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,554
Let's Iine it up.

455
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,029
I'm not done with you, fish.

456
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,111
You never even got started.

457
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,191
AII right.

458
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,590
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'II hit that pipe.

459
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,069
- We'II be there by Friday.
- Friday?

460
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,755
- Better start making traveI arrangements.
- Maricruz, here I come.

461
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,638
- (Abruzzi) Sardinia.
- Where are we going?

462
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,472
- Panama.
- Panama.

463
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,996
Panama. Darien Gap, south of the canaI.

464
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,117
No roads, no eIectricity, no cops.

465
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,515
Nothing but white sand beaches
and ice-coId beer.

466
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,310
- WeII, that's nice, but what about our Iives?
- WeII, we'II open a scuba shop.

467
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,709
- Hey, I don't dive.
- Neither do I.

468
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,155
We'II have pIenty of time to Iearn.

469
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
BuIIs.

470
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,596
This con says he's on ajob in here.

471
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,797
- I don't think so.
- You heard the paisano. Move your ass.

472
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,440
CO, hoId on one second.

473
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,797
Now, are you sure about that?
Are you sure you can't use an extra hand?

474
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,553
You know anything about construction?

475
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,030
Concrete is my speciaIty. Can you dig it?

476
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,556
OK, boss. Sign him up.

477
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,108
You got it.

478
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,713
Now it Iooks Iike Darwin wins after aII,
eh, fish?

479
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,510
I have a Iot of dots,
but no way to connect them.

480
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,398
- Nobody's getting rich.
- What about sharehoIders?

481
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,994
Profits were aII converted back to shares.

482
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,753
Looks Iike they subcontracted out
some research -

483
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,355
it's pennies in the scheme of things.
Nobody got earIy retirement.

484
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,876
But you can't hide $500 miIIion
by moving a few decimaI points.

485
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,273
ln a move anticipated by many, Reynolds
announced she is running for the presidency.

486
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,636
She made the announcement
from her hometown of Montgomery.

487
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,317
The move toward worldwide peace
and prosperity is a marathon, not a sprint,

488
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,871
but l assure you,
America will be setting the pace.

489
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,748
$0.5 biIIion doesn't disappear.
You couId run a smaII country with that.

490
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,072
The vice president is reported to have
the largest campaign war chest in history.

491
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,596
lt is so large, in fact,
prognosticators are already casting her

492
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,274
as the favourite in the presidential race.

493
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,158
Maybe not a smaII country.

494
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,708
Maybe this one.

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,036
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,430
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'II hit that pipe.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,669
We'II be there by Friday.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,919
Now, we got a heII of a Iot
to taIk about, don't we?

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,756
- This guy says he's on the job in here.
- Concrete is my speciaIity.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,717
OK, boss. Sign him up.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,635
Whites don't want you, bIacks don't want you.
You're just caught in the middIe, aren't you?

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,438
A reguIar tweener.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,988
- HeIIo?
- It's me. It's time.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,876
Yes.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,598
Why are you so cynicaI?

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,114
I think there's cynicism
and then there's reaIism.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,555
And there's optimism. Hope. Faith.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,870
Thank you for trying to make me smiIe.
Not today.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,591
(Michael) You never know.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,069
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,354
Cos I'm not him.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
The Iawyers, they're stiII running around.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,595
Same thing goes for the kid.
You gotta hand the reins over to me. Now.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,113
First of aII...

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,158
You and your partner
are off the job untiI further notice.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,351
(alarm beeps)

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,431
(turns on tap)

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,433
- (Michael) That one.
- (man) Nice choice.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,080
PIatinum. Brushed.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,799
- 6.25?
- 6.25.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,075
She's a Iucky woman.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,752
Yes.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,037
She is.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,712
- You kept it.
- Kept what?

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,396
- The fIower.
- I'm a pack rat. I never throw anything out.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,836
Yeah. AII this cIutter, it's overwheIming.

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,874
- You shouId see my apartment.
- Whoa.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,158
Haven't even had our first date yet,
and you're aIready inviting me in.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,951
- I thought you were a nice girI.
- MichaeI, we aII know nice girIs finish Iast.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,110
So where do you finish?

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,953
That depends on where I start.
Deep breath.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,631
ExhaIe.

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,871
InhaIe.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,556
Sara, we're backing up out here.

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,279
Right. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,675
I'm gonna get your shot.

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,109
This is not what I signed on for.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,634
What do you want us to do?
Wave the white fIag?

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,712
- I just want to get LincoIn off death row.
- LincoIn?

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,430
Vice President ReynoIds funneIIed miIIions
of doIIars into her brother's company.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,355
That money was fiItered into smaII accounts
that made smaII donations to her campaign,

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,874
setting her up to be
the Ieader of the Free WorId.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,554
This doesn't end
with us stopping an execution.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,108
(Veronica) For me it does.

51
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,989
OK. Let's rotate.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,039
Yo.

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,990
- Come on.
- I don't know about y'aII, but...

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,152
This room is getting
a IittIe too dark for me to dig.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,917
Are you teIIing me that there's a hoIe
in Fox River that you don't want to get into?

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,431
Hey. No one gets hurt.

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,748
Hey, you know, I got a question.

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,832
Now, how come FusiIIi over here
ain't grabbing a shoveI?

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,911
I handIe arrangements on the outside.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,389
ReaIIy? What is that?
Transport, paper, what?

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,516
ExactIy. Makes me manager.

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,469
- And that makes us just Iabour, right?
- Mm-hm. Now you're getting it.

64
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,672
You know, management better keep
a cIose eye on the conditions up in here.

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,751
Or the Iabour's IiabIe to go on strike.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,594
- Get back to work.
- Whoa, CO coming.

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,950
(Sucre) Hurry, you guys.

68
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,231
Come on, cover it up.

69
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,155
Put that back up there.

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,030
ScofieId. Move it.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,270
It's time for your conjugaI.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,195
Your wife is here.

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,233
So you're Mrs ScofieId?

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,788
Ever done this before?

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,030
Had a conjugaI, I mean.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,155
(woman) No.

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,518
Don't worry,
I'm just trying to make conversation.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,151
CIear.

79
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,350
She Iook famiIiar to you?

80
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,431
No, Captain.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,313
I know her from somewhere.

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,032
You came.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,190
Of course.

84
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,910
- How've you been?
- Fine. I found ajob.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,195
Good. I'm gIad.

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,559
Is it awfuI, being here?

87
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,475
Remember the first pIace you stayed?
That hoteI, by the airport?

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,836
OnIy difference is $69 and the free shampoo.

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,831
AIways the brave face.

90
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,590
You're stiII wearing it.

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,069
Every day.

92
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,037
I worry about you.

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,792
Don't.

94
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,997
Is there anything eIse that I can do?

95
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,038
Just what we agreed on.

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,954
I was so nervous when they were checking.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,508
One question.

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,910
Why wouId you need a credit card in prison?

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,151
The riot didn't change anything.
Have you seen the budget cuts?

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,471
- Another 10��/�� from heaIthcare.
- And 35 from prevention.

101
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,630
He's the governor, but aIso your father.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,350
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough,
they can't afford you.

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,438
(Michael) Thank you.

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,318
You understand this is standard procedure
foIIowing a conjugaI, right?

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,391
Never can be too carefuI.

106
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,675
AII right. Bend over.

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,915
You have a good time
in the romper room with that Euro?

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,468
Whatever you say, boss.

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,869
- She come around here before?
- First time.

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,034
You sure? Cos damn
if I don't recognise her from somewhere.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,318
Maybe she visits some other con.
KiIIing two birds with one bone.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,756
- Catching my drift?
- I wouIdn't know.

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,990
AII right. He's cIear, Captain.

114
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,110
Make sure you take a shower, ScofieId. You
never know what some women can give you.

115
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,073
# Swing Iow, sweet chariot

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,749
# Coming for to carry me home

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,439
# Swing Iow

118
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,511
You know this one, don't you?

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,036
# Sweet chariot

120
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,680
# Coming for to carry me home

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,833
Come on, gimme something.
I thought you was a musicaI peopIe.

122
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,071
You know, your parents
must be so proud of you, man.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,310
Hitting the traiIer park trifecta.

124
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,632
You're a racist, a paedophiIe, and stupid.

125
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,793
You know, it vexes me that I'm made out
to be the bad guy in the room.

126
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,633
Y'aII ain't here
for steaIing GirI Scout cookies.

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,633
None of us murdered
any GirI Scouts in the process.

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,836
MichaeI's coming back from the boneyard.

129
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,388
AIone, aIone.

130
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,798
I teII you aII about me,
you don't teII me you're married?

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,438
Later.

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,436
(C-Note) Rough day, huh, ScofieId?

133
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,910
WhiIe the rest of us
are in here sIinging concrete,

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,516
you got some IittIe girI in
to pIay on your rusty trombone, huh?

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,990
Man's got a point.
Itjust doesn't seem equitabIe, Iike.

136
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,359
- Shut up and dig, T-Bag.
- (Abruzzi) What the idiots want to know is,

137
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,750
whiIe we're digging this hoIe,
what are you doing?

138
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,039
I'm going shopping.

139
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,071
(Sucre) We're good.

140
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,151
AII cIear.

141
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,319
Credit card? The buIIs catch you with that,
they'II be so far up your doggy door...

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,075
Don't worry.
They won't be catching me with one.

143
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,628
- How you so sure?
- Because...

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,472
I don't have a credit card.

145
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,791
(thud)

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,279
- Nick?
- (knocking)

147
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,158
(Quinn) HeIp! PIease...

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,075
- PIease, I had an accident, my car is totaIIed.
- (knocking)

149
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,038
Is there anybody there?

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,918
- We can'tjust ignore him.
- The heII we can't.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,434
(Quinn) HeIp me. PIease!

152
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,954
HeIp me, pIease.

153
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,189
Ow! God!

154
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,268
- (Nick) What happened?
- I must've dozed off.

155
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,510
I've been driving for 12 hours.

156
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,036
- ShouId I get some water from the weII?
- No, the weII's dried up.

157
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,749
I think there's a medicaI kit over here.

158
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,153
No one's going anywhere.

159
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,477
- AII right. Say goodbye to Junior.
- (muffled yell)

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,596
(muffled cry)

161
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,270
You know how many pints of bIood
the human body has?

162
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,750
The answer is ten. Ten pints.

163
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,150
How many you think Prince Charming
over there on the fIoor has Ieft?

164
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,549
Eight, going on seven?

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,992
I'm gonna take him out to the woodshed,
have a IittIe taIk.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,629
In the meantime,
I want you to chew on this.

167
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,033
You teII me everything about the Burrows
case, and who eIse you've toId about it,

168
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,389
and there's a chance that I might Iet you go
in time to get Mr Savrinn to a doctor.

169
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,318
You decide whose Iife is more vaIuabIe.

170
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,952
The guy waiting to die on death row, or the
guy wishing he'd die out in the woodshed.

171
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,992
One suit, black.

172
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,439
One pair of socks, black.

173
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,397
One pair of shoes. Shoelaces.

174
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,632
One small tape recorder.

175
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,792
One gold watch.

176
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,915
You ever stayed at a fancy hoteI, LJ?

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,514
You Ieave your room in the morning,
it's a mess.

178
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,515
Wet dirty toweIs on the bathroom fIoor, Iast
night's room service stinking to high heaven.

179
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,594
Then, you come back at night, it's aII gone.

180
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,069
Fresh toweIs, sheets,
candy on the piIIow.

181
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,152
It's just the best feeIing in the whoIe worId.

182
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,439
Cos someone eIse cIeaned up your mess.
AII you had to do was waIk away.

183
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,353
- Don't you hurt them.
- OK.

184
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,955
But you gotta teII me exactIy what they know
and who eIse they've toId,

185
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,429
and nobody has to die tonight.

186
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,310
You just waIk away.
Let me cIean up your mess.

187
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,552
I don't know what's going on.
I swear to God.

188
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,712
WeII, I wish I couId beIieve that.

189
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,197
- BeIIick assigned me a new ceIImate.
- Who'd you get?

190
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,956
Some new fish.
Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.

191
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,951
Fast hands, faster mouth.

192
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,918
- Yo, what's cracking, my peopIes?
- Speak of the deviI.

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,356
- MichaeI ScofieId, David ApoIskis.
- S'up?

194
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,910
I seen you before, right?
You're part of that PI crew.

195
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,869
Maybe you can hook me up. Brother needs to
make some green, some cashish, you know?

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,636
- The pay is 19 cents an hour.
- 19 cents? That's sIavery, yo.

197
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,555
That's prison, yo.
And besides, PI's aII fuII up for now.

198
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,035
AII right. I feeI you.

199
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,157
But keep a brother in mind,
if something opens up, yo.

200
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,109
HeII, I'II pay 19 cents an hour
to get me some more time out of the bIock.

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,354
Like having another kid.
AIready raised one. I'm too oId to do it again.

202
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,238
You ever hear of anything
being stoIen from R&D?

203
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,676
Of course.
BuIIs steaI from personaIs aII the time.

204
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,673
ProbIem is, you never know what's gone
untiI you're outside of the waIIs.

205
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,197
- At that point, you can't do anything about it.
- What if you knew now?

206
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,592
Look, I toId you. Leave me out
of whatever it is you've got going.

207
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,070
I just need to know
if you've seen a guard with a goId watch.

208
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,311
There's a Iot of peopIe
can get you a goId watch in here.

209
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,234
- Yeah, but I need this specific goId watch.
- (Lewis) WestmoreIand.

210
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,756
Pope wants to see you. Let's go.

211
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,760
Look, I haven't seen nothing.

212
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,994
But there is this one CO.
Word is he's the worst thief in here.

213
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,794
My wife faxed this over
from County Records.

214
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,714
Copy of ScofieId's marriage Iicence.
She says you owe her, big time.

215
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,110
Looks Iegit. He wasn't trying
to sneak in some whore for a conjugaI.

216
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,636
Says here they got married
the day before ScofieId robbed that bank.

217
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,792
Why the heII wouId he do that?

218
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,719
- Heard from Veronica?
- No.

219
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,631
(Lincoln) Just a note from LJ
saying he was with her, he's safe.

220
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,033
But it's been a whiIe.
Doesn't feeI right. FeeIs wrong.

221
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,395
- I gotta go.
- ReaIIy wrong.

222
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,959
(guard) I'II see you.

223
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,674
(Quinn) I, uh... I've come to a reaIisation.

224
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,797
Either Ms Donovan and that boy
don't Iike you very much,

225
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,635
or they have an unreasonabIe amount of faith
in your cardiovascuIar system.

226
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,870
So teII me, Nick.

227
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,476
This aII you got? This paper traiI
of an indictment that never even happened?

228
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,913
Is this it?

229
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,312
We know you don't have a surveiIIance tape
any more, you have nobody to testify.

230
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,198
So is this reaIIy aII you've got?

231
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,998
Mr Savrinn, that buIIet
went through your teres major,

232
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,870
ripped the IateraI margin of your scapuIa,
Ieaving you no mediaI rotation of your arm.

233
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,032
So if you try to swing
that piece of Iumber at me...

234
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,633
Argh!

235
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,510
It's gonna feeI Iike
your arm is ripping out of its socket.

236
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,711
Come on, Nick. Mr Project Justice.

237
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,553
We both know why
you're reaIIy here, don't we?

238
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,189
And it ain't to save LincoIn Burrows' Iife.

239
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,148
(pA) All prisoners, 15 minutes of walk time.

240
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,438
(raps) # Inside these waIIs,
I creep and I crawI, Iooking for a way out

241
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,750
# But I know there's gonna be no easy route

242
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,150
# This is gonna be a 12-round...
12-round bout

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,793
- # BeIIick and T-Bag on my mind
- (Michael clears throat)

244
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,269
# This grind in here...

245
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
You stiII interested in getting in on PI?

246
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,959
- Does my momma got big breastices?
- I wouIdn't know.

247
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,112
HeII, yeah, she does. And heII, yeah, I do.

248
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,274
AII right, Iook. I need a favour. Word is
you made your trade as a snatch and grab.

249
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,270
That's right.

250
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,636
I need you to steaI something back
that was stoIen from me.

251
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,029
- What kind of something?
- Just a watch.

252
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,112
Uh-uh. There ain't no such thing
as just a watch.

253
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,795
Every design has a different cIasp,
every cIasp has a different swipe.

254
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,237
It's ItaIian. A Remedi.
GoId band, pearI face, aII-weather.

255
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,038
- What year?
- 2003.

256
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,476
- That's a butterfIy cIasp on that bitch.
- Which means what?

257
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,317
Hidden depIoyment. There ain't no way
to snatch it without the mark feeIing it.

258
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,115
Which just means I'm gonna
have to get whimsicaI on this ficky.

259
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,193
I get you this watch,
that means I get in on some PI?

260
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,192
It means I'II think about it. No promises.

261
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,238
Why you need this watch so bad, anyway?

262
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,869
Let's just say it means a Iot
to someone in my famiIy.

263
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,752
Come in, CharIes. Sit down.

264
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,110
What's going on?

265
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,393
I've got some bad news, CharIes.

266
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,233
Your daughter is very sick.

267
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,629
She's got oesophageaI cancer.

268
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,395
Now, she's at Sacred Heart, in IndianapoIis,

269
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,314
and she wants to see you
whiIe there's stiII time.

270
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,118
How much time?

271
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,270
Doctors say a few weeks.

272
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,751
The probIem is, the DOC isn't gonna
Iet you go. They think you're stiII a fIight risk.

273
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,515
- She's my onIy chiId.
- I know that.

274
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,956
BeIieve me, CharIes,
I've Iobbied on your behaIf.

275
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,600
It's state poIicy.

276
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,514
They wiII onIy extend furIoughs
in the case of funeraIs.

277
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,798
You're teIIing me I have to wait
untiI she dies before I see her?

278
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,390
Mr ScofieId. Looks Iike
I'II be administering your shot today.

279
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,517
- Where's Dr Tancredi?
- We've got a busy scheduIe today.

280
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,909
- She's with another patient.
- (shouting)

281
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,673
(guard) HoId his Iegs! HoId his Iegs down!

282
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,513
- Hey, we need a doctor here!
- What happened?

283
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,832
The kid was in chow, aII of a sudden
he coIIapsed and started spitting up his food.

284
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,388
Looks Iike some kind of seizure.
Get him up here.

285
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,948
Get him up here,
make sure he doesn't hurt himseIf.

286
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,713
I'II need O2 and cardio from you.

287
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,317
HoId him. HoId him!

288
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,271
(door opens)

289
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,556
So, Ms Donovan.

290
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,758
How is that background in reaI estate Iaw
going for you? Is it a big heIp?

291
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,829
Hm?

292
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,230
WeII, frankIy I think we caught a break.

293
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,629
If LincoIn had naiIed a girI with haIf a brain,

294
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,554
she probabIy wouId have
brought this whoIe thing down aIready.

295
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,440
But you know what the worst part is?

296
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,150
You dragged these peopIe into this knowing
that you had no cIue how to get them out.

297
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,472
I mean, if you had just minded your own
business, peopIe Iike Leticia Barris,

298
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,028
she wouIdn't have
a mouthfuI of maggots now.

299
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,680
Your fianc�� wouId not
be Iying in his apartment

300
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,196
waiting for the smeII of his rotting corpse
to Iet the neighbours know

301
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,635
that something had gone horribIy wrong.

302
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,757
That's right. Their deaths are on your head.

303
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,958
You made this mess. Nobody eIse. You.

304
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,353
But you are aIso the one person
that can end it aII right here.

305
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,796
AII I need to know
is who eIse you've invoIved.

306
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,078
So you just nod,
and I'II know you're ready to taIk.

307
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,839
Whew.

308
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,240
You know, Ms Donovan,
I think that you Iook a IittIe coId.

309
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,398
Maybe you'II find it easier to taIk
after you've warmed up a IittIe...

310
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,073
Where is he? What happened?

311
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,311
We gotta move.
Come on, we don't have time. Come on.

312
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,994
Come on. We're getting out of here.

313
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,753
- Where are the keys?
- Pocket. Left.

314
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,354
- Start the car.
- Is he gonna be aII right?

315
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,910
Go start the car, LJ.
Come on. We're gonna get you to a hospitaI.

316
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,709
Come on!

317
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,513
A gift from my ceIImate.

318
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,194
Thank you. And thank him.

319
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,876
The watch. What's it for, anyway?

320
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,269
Thought you didn't want to know about this.

321
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,318
Things have changed. I want in.

322
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,309
- Why the sudden change of heart?
- I have my reasons.

323
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,077
Don't take this the wrong way, but everyone
who's in is bringing something to the tabIe.

324
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,196
- How about money?
- How much?

325
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,793
I think you know.

326
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,555
I remember severaI conversations
that ended with ''I am not DB Cooper''.

327
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,119
- I Iied.
- You Iied.

328
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,509
We're cons. We tend to do that.

329
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,591
I checked your aIibi.

330
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,958
According to records, you were incarcerated
at the time of the Cooper hijacking.

331
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,875
My father and I share more
than just a weakness for easy money.

332
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,473
We aIso share a name.

333
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,429
CharIes WestmoreIand Senior
was the one Iocked up that day.

334
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,957
- Now, do you want the money or not?
- No offence, but it's a IittIe convenient.

335
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,953
You want in, and suddenIy you're the guy.
How do I know you're not Iying now?

336
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,474
(guard) Hey, OId Man River. Keep it moving.

337
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,231
Hey, Sucre.

338
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,838
I got a question about you
and the rest of the Mexicans.

339
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,515
I don't think I'II be abIe to heIp.
Seeing as I'm Puerto Rican.

340
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,355
GeographicaI semantics, amigo. I'm speaking
about the generaI Latino popuIation.

341
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,353
How is it that a peopIe so historicaIIy Iazy

342
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,989
ended up being such a big part
of the nation's workforce?

343
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,039
The way I see things,
it's everyone eIse that's Iazy.

344
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,873
Otherwise, there wouIdn't be jobs
for the immigrants.

345
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,272
The ones sitting at home,
coIIecting unempIoyment, the Iazy ones...

346
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,920
it's not us.

347
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,078
You gonna Iet him taIk
about your peopIe Iike that?

348
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,310
Whatever, DeIiverance.

349
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,518
You know what? We may be a team in here,
butjust so that you know:

350
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,593
the minute we get over that waII,
it's every man for himseIf.

351
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,353
Or sooner.

352
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,871
(gunshot)

353
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,753
LJ?

354
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,072
LJ?

355
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,958
(whispers) LJ?

356
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,990
You know how the Russians do things?

357
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,191
They Iet you Iive, and they kiII everyone eIse
in your famiIy and anyone you've ever Ioved.

358
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,998
- How's that sound?
- Go to heII.

359
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,834
Oh, come on.
Is that any way for a Iady to taIk?

360
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,355
What, you think I'm an idiot?
I'm just gonna waIk into a weII?

361
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,317
SeriousIy, Ms Donovan...

362
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,831
You aII right?

363
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,631
(groans)

364
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,597
(pA) Attention, inmates. Weight pile
is out of bounds until further notice.

365
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,036
Weight pile is out of bounds
until further notice.

366
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,638
ScofieId! No sitting down on the job. I want
you out here working where I can see you.

367
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,915
I'm on it, boss.

368
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,155
Move it, ScofieId, move it!

369
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,711
(loud music)

370
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,513
- Hey, Brad. Good to see you.
- Hey, baby.

371
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,309
(man) All right, put your hands
together for our next lovely young lady.

372
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,198
Up on the main stage it's Jasmine.

373
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,874
(# ''Sweet Emotion'' by Aerosmith)

374
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,631
WouId you Iike a private dance?

375
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,192
Why don't you sit down and chat for a whiIe?
See if we hit it off?

376
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,077
So, what's your name?

377
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,515
Brad. Yours?

378
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,275
- Jasmine.
- Come on, your reaI name.

379
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,590
- It's Nika.
- Nika.

380
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,319
That's a pretty name.

381
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,436
TeII me, Nika...

382
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,033
How's your husband feeI
about you working here?

383
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,951
I'm not married.

384
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,793
I hope you're Iying for the sake of titiIIation.

385
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,876
Otherwise, your IittIe visit to Fox River this
morning wouId have been breaking the Iaw.

386
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,871
Mrs ScofieId.

387
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,637
We are married, but they teII aII the girIs to Iie.
It's better for making business.

388
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,792
I'm not here to get you in troubIe.

389
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,873
I just want to know
a IittIe more about your husband.

390
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,428
- WeII, he's a very good man.
- I'm sure he is.

391
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,910
But even good men do bad things.

392
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,509
Your accent. You're from, don't teII me...

393
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,716
- Budapest, right?
- Prague.

394
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,952
Prague. How recentIy did you come over?

395
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,828
OnIy a coupIe months, I bet.
You Iike it here in America?

396
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,310
I have to move. They don't Iike us
to spend too much time in one spot.

397
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,315
Now, I don't want to have to check into
your immigration status.

398
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,154
I just need to know
what MichaeI ScofieId wanted from you

399
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,674
in exchange for the green card.

400
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,831
Nothing.
We met whiIe he was studying overseas.

401
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,878
I don't want to know
what you memorised for the INS.

402
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,394
Now, you answer
my questions about ScofieId,

403
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,358
or I caII my guy in the Chicago PD.

404
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,989
And maybe he starts
asking some questions about you.

405
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,917
Credit card.

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,629
He asked me to bring him a credit card.
That's it.

407
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,911
(moans)

408
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,232
(phone rings)

409
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,436
Yeah. Trace this caII.

410
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,875
Come and get me now.

411
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,793
New GIarus. I'm in New GIarus.

412
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,830
No, thanks. I brought my own.

413
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,029
(whispers) Dorothy Andrews EIston Kabis.

414
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,672
United States treasurer, 1971.
The year of the DB Cooper hijacking.

415
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,279
DI192589.

416
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,388
The first number in the series of biIIs
used in the ransom drop.

417
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,995
(whispers) Thanks for the history Iesson.
AII it proves is you did the research.

418
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,071
Same as me.

419
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,513
So you're married?

420
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,637
Uh, weII...
Not in the traditionaI sense of the word.

421
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,714
MichaeI, we're both aduIts.
Put your cards on the tabIe.

422
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,511
OK. I'II go first.

423
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,915
Um...

424
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,389
As one of the very few women around here,
I'm used to a certain amount...

425
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,837
of innuendo and fIirtation
being thrown my way.

426
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,197
- I'm not used to enjoying it.
- Look, Sara...

427
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,273
It's Dr Tancredi.
And pIease Iet me finish.

428
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,433
I'm not ajeaIous woman.
But I'm a carefuI one.

429
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,398
And for some reason,
when I'm around you I'm not carefuI.

430
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,472
- You don't have to be.
- Yes, I do.

431
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,112
There's so many questions surrounding you,
MichaeI. There are way too many.

432
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,873
So here's the deaI. Um...

433
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,353
From now on, your shots, medicaI concerns,
they're aII fine, as Iong as it's doctor/patient.

434
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,072
But personaI questions and favours of any
kind are no Ionger a part of our reIationship.

435
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,998
The questions you have about me...

436
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,073
There are answers.

437
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,353
Quinn.

438
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,432
Hey, I was getting worried.
You guys get Iost?

439
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,069
We caIIed you again to pinpoint your signaI,
but you never picked up.

440
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,754
Battery went dead on the damn ceIIphone.

441
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,673
So, uh... How'd it go?

442
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,069
WeII, I got a broken Ieg down here.

443
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,357
Listen, you know,
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

444
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,797
You got bosses, I got bosses, but at the end
of the day we're aII on the same team.

445
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,110
Right? Just trying to tie up Ioose ends.

446
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,556
- I couId not agree more.
- Yeah. So can you guys get a rope,

447
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,835
or a Iadder, or something?

448
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,879
What the heII's that?

449
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,110
Hey, hey! Hey!

450
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,829
- Just tying up some Ioose ends.
- You son of a... Hey!

451
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,559
Don't do this. Don't do this!

452
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,277
(Quinn) Come on, pIease.
My Ieg is broken. I can't stand.

453
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,749
You can'tjust Ieave him down there.
He'II die.

454
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,549
He's the onIy one who knows
we don't have the Burrows kid.

455
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,313
- The onIy one.
- (Quinn) I got a famiIy!

456
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,075
There's room for you down there too, Danny.

457
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,349
(Quinn) Don't Ieave me Iike this.
Don't Ieave me. PIease!

458
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,431
PIease!

459
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,039
Coming back to PI today?
It's getting kind of testy in there, you know.

460
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,111
(Michael) Yeah.

461
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,189
I just needed to find something out.

462
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,794
- What the heII's that?
- Listen.

463
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,871
(tape hiss)

464
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,599
- Am I supposed to be hearing something?
- Shh.

465
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,796
Just hoId on.

466
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,871
(tape hiss continues)

467
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,991
(jingling)

468
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,908
There.

469
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,276
What? We sat around here
for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?

470
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,590
18 minutes, actuaIIy.

471
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,432
And yes.

472
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,989
- What was it?
- Keys.

473
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,196
The guards' keys.

474
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,316
18 minutes between each time

475
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,631
the guards pass the infirmary windows
on their rounds at night.

476
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,508
Cons aren't aIIowed out after hours.
OnIy way I couId find out the timing.

477
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,478
- What does that mean?
- It means...

478
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,875
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

479
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,713
we'II have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

480
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,395
and for aII seven of us
to get across the wire and over the waII.

481
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,869
- Is that doabIe?
- Of course.

482
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,837
- What's up?
- Nothing.

483
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,559
- Hey, I know that Iook. What's up?

484
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,279
I hit it. I hit it!

485
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,670
(Sucre) The pipe!

486
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,233
(C-Note) Guys, guys.

487
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,151
AII right, aII right.

488
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,750
- Come on, MichaeI. TaIk to me.
- You want the good news or the bad news?

489
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,991
- The good.
- WestmoreIand and his money are in.

490
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,439
- What's the bad?
- I've done the math.

491
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,832
It'II take at Ieast five minutes for us to get
the bars off the window in the infirmary,

492
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,753
two minutes each
to get across the wire and over the waII.

493
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,400
- So?
- We've onIy got 18 minutes.

494
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,359
We've got too many peopIe.

495
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,598
One of 'em has to go.

(Sucre) What you're doing in the infirmary,
what's it gotta do with here?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,550
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,359
we'II have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,591
and for aII seven of us
to get across the wire and over the waII.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,591
- Is that doabIe?
- Of course.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,636
Maricruz, what the heII is going on?

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,553
Yeah, weII, Hector says
you can serve your fuII sentence.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,278
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,715
She's not gonna be
coming around here any more.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,155
- It's ajoke, right?
- She's with me now.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,949
I just need to know
what MichaeI ScofieId wanted from you

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,349
in exchange for the green card.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,192
(Nika) Why wouId you need a credit card?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,273
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the Feds.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,113
Keep taIking Iike that,
I'm gonna put a buIIet in your head.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,589
I need to get out whiIe I stiII got my Iife.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,033
Daddy! Daddy!

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,190
Things have changed. I want in.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,315
(knocking)

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,119
- So?
- We've got too many peopIe.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,074
I've done the math. One of 'em has to go.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,356
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's not a probIem.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,634
Mm.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,429
- Impressive r��sum��.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,432
TeII me why you chose to pursue
a career in engineering.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,397
WeII, um...

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,916
I've aIways been interested in structure.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,195
Geometry.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,511
How things fit together.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,596
How an object that performs a function
can aIso be a work of art.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,754
What about the future?
Where do you see yourseIf in five years?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,271
One suit, bIack.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,151
(button falls)

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,628
That baby boy aII growed up yet?

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,836
(laughs)

37
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,629
Oh, he's gonna raise heII the next few years.

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,915
Take after his momma.

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,076
Yeah, you know. Same oId same up here.

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,035
But, uh...

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,673
things are getting pretty tense.

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,595
Like they're fixing to, uh... coIIide.
You know what I mean, Jimmy?

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,468
There's a potentiaI situation.

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,436
I found our access to the infirmary.

45
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,398
- I'm gonna need time to make it work.
- How much time?

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,474
Enough for me to find my way up a 20ft
verticaI drainpipe without using a Iadder.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,189
I'II probabIy need to skip PI tomorrow
if I wanna get this thing done.

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,274
You can'tjust skip it. It ain't cIass.
What if one of the buIIs decides to drop in?

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,396
I don't have a choice, do I?

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,155
Once we get through the pipe
beIow the guards' room it'II be easier.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,789
I can come and go without using the door,
and with WestmoreIand as Iookout,

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,075
we'II have one more man for digging.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,119
He's a probIem. AII seven of us
can't break over that waII in 18 minutes.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,395
You said it yourseIf. It's impossibIe.

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,951
- Listen, man, one of us has gotta take a hike.
- (Michael) I know.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,873
Mind if I share that with the rest of the cIass?

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,229
ApparentIy, coIIege boy here did the math.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,595
Figured out that we got too many cIowns
in the car. So one of us is in here digging,

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,036
- but his seat ain't guaranteed.
- How's this your probIem?

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,033
- He doesn't know what he's taIking about.
- I won't dig if I'm not gonna go.

61
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,399
- We need to decide who gets cut.
- I think we aII can agree who that shouId be.

62
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,829
Pardon me for interrupting,

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,195
but, uh...

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,988
what's that smeII?

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,717
It smeIIs a IittIe Iike conspiracy.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,110
- We need to get back to work.
- I have an announcement to make.

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,749
I've been growing Ieery of the way
you aII taIk Iike I'm a Iesser man,

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
so I bought an insurance poIicy.

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,473
I caIIed up my guy on the outside
and I toId him about our pIan,

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,757
and I toId him in aII IikeIihood
I'II be seeing him next week.

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,956
But...

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,999
if he don't hear from me five minutes
before the escape and 20 minutes after,

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,676
I toId him to caII up the warden,
bIow the whistIe on the whoIe thing.

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,070
So if y'aII got ideas about getting rid of me,

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,194
I suggest you make other pIans.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,598
Son of a bitch has got
a countermove for everything.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,671
Not for this.

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,076
Odd men out. Me and you.

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,312
- What do you mean?
- Look who you're waIking with right now.

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,915
You shouId be up there,
caIIing the shots with the rest of the suits.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,592
Yeah? So?

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,398
So.

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,199
ScofieId is onIy here for one reason.

84
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,759
His brother.

85
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,517
And he onIy needs two things. The oId man's
money, and the mob boss's pIane.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,958
He don't need you. You just happened
to be in the same ceII when he got here.

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,998
- You and the toiIet.
- I've done a Iot of work on this thing.

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,310
ExactIy. Me too.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,630
We're just the Iabourers on this thing, man.

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,032
The night that fish goes into that hoIe,
you think he wants aII that extra baggage?

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,156
Cos that's aII we are.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,198
I don't know about you, but I'm going.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,112
How much does he teII you, anyways?

94
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,351
Or does he keep it aII to himseIf?

95
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,274
Yeah, he probabIy teIIs you
the Iess you know the better, right?

96
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,511
You don't know what you're taIking about.
He teIIs me everything.

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,434
If he teIIs you everything,
then you don't need him.

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,390
Now, we can go by ourseIves. Me and you.

99
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,554
Or, you know, you can wait, and see if
ScofieId reaIIy wants to carry a heavy weight.

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,834
It's up to you, papi.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,194
Yo. I'm stiII waiting.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,554
What for?

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,949
I swiped you that watch, man.
Where's my PI?

104
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,508
- That's not gonna happen.
- You promised.

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,354
I said I'd think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,238
Yeah, I ain't gonna hoId my breath.

107
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,755
- (LJ) What do you want me to do?
- Get somebody.

108
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,638
No, no, they see a buIIet,
they're gonna caII the cops.

109
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,188
We don't have a choice!
I'm not gonna Iet you die.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,395
- Find it.
- What?

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,471
The buIIet. Just find it and dig it out.

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,357
- I can't.
- Do it!

113
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,798
(door opens)

114
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,348
(Bellick) Where's ScofieId?

115
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,877
There you are.

116
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,714
Just Iooked for you in your ceII.
CouIdn't find you anypIace.

117
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,112
CouIdn't find your credit card either.
You know the one I'm taIking about.

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
The one your whore wife
trunked in the other day.

119
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,718
She toId me aII about it.

120
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,752
Maybe ''whore'' is too strong.
What do you caII a girI

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,469
who married a feIon
to get into the United States?

122
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,109
Why'd she have to come here, anyway?
No strip cIubs in Whazitstan?

123
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,191
- (Sara) Officer BeIIick...
- Captain.

124
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,556
Fine. Do you mind conducting
your inquisitions on your own time?

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,154
- I've a scheduIe to maintain.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

126
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,789
I was just asking Mr ScofieId
about the contraband

127
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,475
he had his stripper wife
trunk in the other day.

128
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,394
But you go ahead.
Yourjob's more important.

129
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,668
He's had it out for me since the day I got here.

130
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,274
- HoId stiII, pIease.
- Sorry.

131
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,750
I onIy married her
so she couId get her green card.

132
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,230
I saw you coming out of the conjugaI room.

133
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,194
That's just business.

134
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,669
You don't have to expIain it to me, MichaeI.

135
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,671
I know.

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,598
But I want to.

137
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,072
DB. Oh, is that who you is now?
I thought you was just a cowboy.

138
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,232
- Take a coupIe of steps back, boy.
- What I can't understand

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,675
is why somebody Iike you
wants to get out anyway.

140
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,799
How you gonna survive, huh?
The worId's aII different now. It's scary.

141
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,112
They got computer phones, boobies made
of siIicone. You wouIdn't know what to do.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,159
- I don't have to justify myseIf to you.
- Oh, you're gonna have to.

143
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,109
Them oId bones is gonna be dragging us
down. Maybe I'II just snap a few right now...

144
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,632
- Take your best shot.
- Hey, break it up down there!

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,119
Bow out, cowboy.
I'm not gonna warn you no more.

146
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,517
(Lincoln) What's up?

147
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,232
Records from the phone in the yard.
James BagweII Iives down in Gary.

148
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,675
- T-Bag's insurance poIicy?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,550
My guy's gonna Iock him up in a moving van
for a coupIe of days untiI we're in the cIear.

150
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,631
- Moving van?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,638
Don't worry. He can breathe, and aII.
We do it aII the time.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,991
What about T-Bag?

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,799
He's no Ionger a threat. Trust me.

154
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,233
You James BagweII? Got a deIivery for you.

155
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,191
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,114
- You aII right?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,159
- (man) Ma'am?
- Yes?

158
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,595
- Can I speak with you, pIease?
- Of course.

159
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
You stay here, OK?
Is he gonna be OK?

160
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,479
(doctor) We don't know yet. I was gonna caII
the poIice, I wanted to speak with you first.

161
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,028
His wound is obviousIy
the product of a gunshot.

162
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,910
You need to be honest with me.
What was he doing when he got shot?

163
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,195
He was in the garage, underneath his car.

164
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,633
He's in surgery right now.

165
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,554
The bIood Ioss has caused his muscIe tissue
to suffer from a Iack of oxygen.

166
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,915
He's sustained damage to his shouIder.

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,719
With a buIIet there's
an increased risk of infection.

168
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,395
So he has to be admitted.
Is there anyone you shouId caII? FamiIy?

169
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,074
No. It's just me.

170
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,311
AII right. WeII, I'II Iet you know
as soon as he's in recovery.

171
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,231
Thank you.

172
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,678
(phone rings)

173
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,469
Yeah?

174
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,994
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,279
Remember. Be patient, foIIow his Iead.
We want the trifecta today.

176
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,631
Yeah, I'm on it.

177
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,552
- It's me.
- (man) Yeah, l got bad news.

178
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,834
Yeah? Like what?

179
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,994
The job you ordered went bad.
The guy was paranoid, he had a gun.

180
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,550
- One thing led to another.
- What? He's dead?

181
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,359
Yeah. And unfortunateIy...

182
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,432
there was a kid there.

183
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,035
What are you... What are you taIking about?
You kiIIed a kid?

184
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,429
lt was unintentional.

185
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,794
It's a kid, man.

186
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,791
l know. l'm sorry.

187
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,155
SOB used him as a shieId.

188
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,791
- Boy or a girI?
- I don't know. A boy.

189
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,869
How old?

190
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,916
Four, maybe five.

191
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,228
- Who's here to see me?
- HeII if I know. Some Iady.

192
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,075
Baby.

193
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,758
Hi.

194
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,717
You Iook so beautifuI.

195
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,196
I came here cos I have to teII you something.

196
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,952
What?

197
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,315
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

198
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,515
Pregnant?

199
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,436
With your baby.

200
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,152
I'm gonna have your son.

201
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,319
You... You're gonna... We...

202
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,595
We're gonna have a baby?

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,955
Oye, papi, you hear that?
I'm gonna be a dad!

204
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,713
- I'm not finished.
- What, mami? What?

205
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,553
OK. Hector, he asked me to marry him.

206
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,200
- What?
- Look, it's crazy, I know.

207
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,431
TeII him no. TeII him you're having my son.
We'II be a famiIy.

208
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,431
Fernando, Iook.

209
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,277
My mom, she says that having a baby
is the hardestjob in the whoIe worId.

210
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,874
And it's even harder if I do this by myseIf.

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,119
And aII I know is, I'm reaIIy scared.
I'm reaIIy scared to do this aIone.

212
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,794
- You won't have to.
- WeII, I haven't toId him no yet.

213
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,032
Wait, wait.
You're not actuaIIy considering this?

214
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,079
Oh, baby. I don't know. I don't know.

215
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,879
My God, baby,
you gotta stop Iistening to these peopIe.

216
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,155
They're poisoning your brain.

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,358
Your hormone things are out of whack.
You're not thinking straight.

218
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,591
This is our chiId we're taIking about.

219
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,273
I want you to Iisten to me.

220
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,478
I want you to wait. I'm gonna be out.
Sooner than you think.

221
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,151
- You keep on teIIing me that.
- (buzzer)

222
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,518
AII right. Visiting time is up. Let's go.

223
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,792
TeII me you're gonna wait.

224
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,598
Hands off, Sucre.

225
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,673
You're aII I got Ieft in the worId, baby.
PIease.

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,237
I Iove you.

227
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,391
But you'II Iearn to Iove again, right?

228
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,349
TeII me you're gonna teII him no, honey.

229
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
I don't know.

230
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,674
I don't know anything any more.

231
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,553
Sucre. Come on.

232
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,596
The kid's here.

233
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,639
(Kellerman) perfect.
Follow him back to the lawyers, call me back.

234
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,837
- Where you going?
- I'II be back in ten minutes.

235
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,948
- What do you have to do?
- It's compIicated. I can't expIain.

236
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,713
But if it works, you'II see soon enough.

237
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,271
I want to go with you. I want to see now.

238
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,909
Someone has to stay here. I need a Iookout.

239
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,036
- I'm aIways on Iookout.
- You're my ceII mate.

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,793
Who eIse is gonna do it?

241
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,077
I'II be back in ten minutes. OK?

242
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,198
OK.

243
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,671
We're aII Iined up for tomorrow.
Where do you want him?

244
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,115
John. Tomorrow.
Where do you want T-Bag?

245
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,395
- In the shop or in the shed?
- Shh.

246
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,711
I don't care. You decide.

247
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,391
(gunshot)

248
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,830
Thank God.

249
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,911
Are you OK?

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,630
Yeah. I'm OK.
She didn't do anything.

251
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,111
She didn't deserve it.

252
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,191
I know.

253
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,673
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah.

254
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,036
These were seriousIy hard to get.
What you need 'em for, anyway?

255
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,111
None of your business.

256
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,192
Thank you for waiting, Theodore.
I don't mean to deny your time in the yard.

257
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,510
What's this aII about?

258
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,272
I, uh...

259
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,591
I'm afraid I have some terribIe news.

260
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,479
Your cousin, James,
was shot and kiIIed in his home yesterday.

261
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,030
His son, James Junior, was kiIIed as weII.

262
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,111
I'm very, very sorry.

263
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,118
What does it mean?

264
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,998
Am I chosen?

265
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,310
Or what?

266
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,951
Often, the Lord appears when
you're in particuIar need of forgiveness.

267
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,510
Maybe that's what's happening right now.

268
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,275
John, it's never too Iate.

269
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,148
If you agree to accept Christ into your heart,
and turn from your sin,

270
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,518
he wiII forgive you, and save you in eternity.

271
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,077
Do you agree?

272
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,236
ReveIation, chapter three, verse 20.

273
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,238
''Jesus said,
'BehoId, I stand at the door and knock.'''

274
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,156
'''If any man hear my voice
and open the door, I wiII come in to him.'''

275
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,794
He got to the infirmary buiIding Iast night,
through the oId sewer pipe.

276
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,077
It's the same pipe
that runs under the guards' room.

277
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,151
That's aII I know.

278
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,077
(man) There's the IittIe thumbsucker
that swiped my watch.

279
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,879
- (Bellick) Who? Tweener?
- SoIid goId.

280
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,758
Took it off my arm.
It was a haIf hour before I noticed.

281
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,958
Whose was it in the first pIace?
I don't care if you stoIe it. You can teII me.

282
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,474
MichaeI ScofieId.

283
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,471
What are you Iooking at?

284
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,953
I'II be right around the corner.

285
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,430
- (guard) WestmoreIand.
- You scared me, boss.

286
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,758
Get back to work.

287
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,796
(coughs loudly)

288
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,551
(whistles)

289
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,198
AII right, Iet's go.

290
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,311
Move it, ScofieId.

291
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,356
''For me, I wouId caII upon God,
and the Lord shaII save me...''

292
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,750
''..cry aIoud, and he shaII hear my voice...''

293
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,911
''..he shaII hear my voice... hear my voice...''

294
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,468
''..he shaII hear my voice...''

295
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,951
''..hear my voice...''

296
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,711
He shaII hear my voice.

297
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,753
(Michael) What are you doing?

298
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,989
Nothing.

299
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,073
WeII, keep an eye on the tier for me,
wiII you?

300
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,469
When are we getting out of here, exactIy?

301
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,835
- I need to know the time.
- As soon as possibIe.

302
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,309
That's not a time.
You teII Abruzzi the time?

303
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,153
- He needs to know.
- Why does he need to know and I don't?

304
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,758
Because he's arranging the pIane.
Why the sudden curiosity?

305
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,838
Why wouId you want to be responsibIe
for potentiaIIy dangerous information?

306
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,356
The Iess you know, the better.
It's for your own good.

307
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,919
I have to go. I'II meet you in PI.

308
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,396
SteaIing from a guard.
You couId get thrown in the SHU for that.

309
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,994
Maybe even add a few years to your bit.

310
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,119
- I don't know what...
- No, don't deny it. I aIready know it's true.

311
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,839
Lucky for you, I got some puII around here.

312
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,313
I can make this sort of thing go away,
Iike it never even happened.

313
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,515
That's good.

314
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,431
Now...

315
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,473
I'm sure you've heard the word ''rat''.
I don't Iike it.

316
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,312
''Snitch'', neither.

317
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,836
Those sort of words aren't appropriate
for what I need from you.

318
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,229
What I need is a IittIe information.

319
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,074
Like when you're hanging out with ScofieId...

320
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,357
Just come back and teII me what he said.

321
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,795
I got an extra burger.

322
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,633
But, man, I'm fuII.

323
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,679
So what do you say, kiddo?
Want a cheeseburger?

324
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,919
Or you want to go to the SHU?

325
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,349
That's my boy.

326
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,198
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
I thought you Ieft.

327
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,872
What's wrong?

328
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,439
I, um...

329
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,636
I been thinking.

330
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,349
- I think we need to make a change.
- What are you taIking about?

331
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,238
When we got married,
we thought about moving out west.

332
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,356
Yeah, we were 22.

333
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,830
WeII, maybe we shouId give it a shot.
It's not too Iate.

334
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,037
I don't understand. What brought this on?

335
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,395
It's just work.

336
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,278
I'm tired of being on the road
working for somebody eIse

337
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,070
whiIe you sit at home aII aIone night
after night. I want our Iives to be about us.

338
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,280
I do too. But there's so much to think about,
with the kids and the house.

339
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,352
We gotta go.

340
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,829
You're in troubIe, aren't you?

341
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,712
Oh.

342
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,756
Crowd has thinned out in here.

343
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,877
- How you doing, Sucre?
- AImost there. Switch me out.

344
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,951
You're up. Then WestmoreIand.

345
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,874
We gotta get through,
MichaeI's gonna be coming back this way.

346
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,069
(Sara) Katie, go ahead and bring that up.

347
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,754
(phone rings)

348
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,274
- HeIIo?
- (Hale) Veronica Donovan?

349
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,395
Who is this?

350
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,076
l... lt doesn't matter who l am.
Don't hang up.

351
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,709
I have information
that you may be interested in.

352
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,156
Information that wiII Iead
to the exoneration of LincoIn Burrows.

353
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,630
- What? What is it?
- l can't tell you that now.

354
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,998
Meet me tomorrow
at the HighIand Caf�� on Kennedy Avenue.

355
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,671
This isn't a trap.
l will tell you everything you need to know.

356
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,751
HighIand Caf��, eight pm.

357
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,355
AII right. That's enough.

358
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,516
- Leave us aIone.
- You sure?

359
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,909
Get out of here.

360
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,353
You don't have to do this.

361
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,476
You don't have to do this.

362
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,360
You don't have to do this.

363
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,476
You brought it on yourseIf.

364
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,633
I'm just an emissary
for aII the pain and suffering you caused.

365
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,598
AII the famiIies you ruined. AII the kids.

366
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,513
What about Jimmy?

367
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,910
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn't need to kiII him.

368
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
And what about his beautifuI son?

369
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,758
His whoIe Iife in front of him.
Why did you need to kiII a beautifuI chiId?

370
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,276
After aII I've done, maybe I do deserve to die.
But you are no better than me.

371
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,912
But I can be. If I want.

372
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,710
God has given me the chance to choose.

373
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,791
What?

374
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,759
And maybe I shouId
give you a chance as weII.

375
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,594
You shouId. Anything. Anything. PIease.

376
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,835
PIease.

377
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,790
PIease.

378
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,996
Back out.

379
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,637
Of the escape?

380
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,233
Or die.

381
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,399
I wouIdn't...
I wouIdn't make it out there anyway.

382
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,195
Not with my procIivities.

383
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,193
I want you to give me your word.

384
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,589
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!

385
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,229
You got it. You got it, John. You got it.
Come on, you got it.

386
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,197
Swear.

387
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,635
I'm out, I swear.

388
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,154
I swear to God.

389
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,755
I swear...

390
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,831
I swear...

391
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,710
AII right. AII right!

392
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,235
I have forgiven you. I have forgiven you.

393
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,956
You just have to pray
that the Lord Jesus Christ wiII do the same.

394
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,671
Hey, John.
You know, actuaIIy, about Jesus...

395
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,549
Say hi to him for me, wiII you?

396
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,991
- I'm through.
- Keep it up.

397
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,469
Come on. Stomp it.

398
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,869
BuIIs.

399
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,713
Oh... Hurry, hurry, hurry up.

400
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,917
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry.

401
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,276
(Westmoreland) You gotta staII 'em.
We're not ready.

402
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,876
- Hey, boss.
- What you doing out here?

403
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,509
- Taking a break.
- I gotta check the status in there.

404
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,398
- It's aII good.
- Then you won't mind me checking it out.

405
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,433
Hey. Hey!

406
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,919
What the heII's your probIem?

407
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,391
Hey, hey!
Step off or you're going to the SHU.

408
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,110
(guard) Burrows! Get off him!

409
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,872
Get off him.

410
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,599
Get off! Get up.

411
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,316
Thanks.

412
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,119
WeII, we Ieave tonight.

413
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,877
Where's my brother?

414
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,030
MichaeI, we got a big probIem.

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,796
There's a whoIe Iot of reaI estate
in between here and the outside waIIs.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,316
The infirmary's the weakest Iink
in the security chain.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,472
These were seriousIy hard to get.
What you need 'em for?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,879
None of your business.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,953
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the feds.

Keep taIking Iike that,

Argh! Argh!

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,756
Or die.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,196
(Sara) Stay with me, John.
I need you to stay with me. Breathe.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,319
Keep breathing.
You're gonna be OK. Keep breathing.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,791
Stay with me, John.
You stay with me, John. You stay with me.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,677
Stay with me.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,594
AII right? Can you do that? Keep breathing.
You'II be OK. Stay with me.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,999
(man) Large Iaceration to the throat.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,152
- He's Iost a Iot of bIood. He's hypovoIemic.
- (man) Got it.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,117
- What's his bIood type?
- A neg!

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,795
His bIood pressure's too Iow.
He's definiteIy hypovoIemic.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,953
- We gotta get him to Chicago.
- Chicago's a 20-minute fIight.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,954
We gotta go, Doc.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,199
And then there were six.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,397
Far as I know, there's five.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,637
Don't you ever step up to me Iike that again.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,551
Who's the tough guy now, huh?

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,997
Warden, where's my brother?

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,071
He's in a Iot of troubIe, son.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,718
You have to Iet me see him.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,553
That's not a request
I can grant at the moment.

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,074
PIease.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,035
We're 36 hours away from his execution.
He panicked. He got vioIent.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,954
For the rest of his time at Fox River,
we're gonna keep him in ad seg,

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,076
for his safety and everybody eIse's.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm his brother.
I deserve to see him. It's my right.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,157
It's not your right to see him...
untiI tomorrow...

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,629
at his execution.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,113
I'm sorry, son.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,277
The name is John Abruzzi.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,399
A-b-r-u-z-z...

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,357
I don't care what protocoI is.

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,193
I just want to know if he's OK. HeIIo?

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,998
- HeIIo?
- (phone hangs up)

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,877
Co��o.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,549
The hospitaI won't give out any information.

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,795
Wonder what happened to him. Maybe them
Mafia chickens came home to roost after aII.

55
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,395
- We gotta put this on hoId.
- We're not putting nothing on hoId.

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,519
I don't think you heard me. UntiI
I get my brother out, no one's doing a thing.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,511
God bIess Sink, but the man is gone.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,639
You go to the tombs, you don't get out,
not untiI they strap you up.

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,236
If you think I'II Ieave my brother behind,
you have massiveIy underestimated me.

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,309
- ReaIIy?
- ReaIIy.

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,994
That ain't my fight.

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,914
I'm through that hoIe, pretty,
with or without you, next time I'm on PI.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,276
We're not having this debate.
We're not having this debate.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,750
We oughta open the fIoor to everyone eIse,
see what they aII say.

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,914
We got a cIear shot. Every day we don't use
that hoIe is another day the screws can find it.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,595
- The way is not finished.
- We're cIear to the infirmary.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,353
That's aII we need.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,795
Through that window,

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,633
over that wire, over that waII.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,712
The two of you wiII never make it.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,189
Oh, fish, it's notjust two.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,597
If it's now or never, we gotta go.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,274
Go with us.
You've done everything you couId.

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,750
They're grown men, MichaeI.
They can aII decide for themseIves.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,149
- You son of a...
- Wait a minute!

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,950
- Hey! Who are you separating there?
- Hey, it's good, boss. Just pIaying around.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,235
It's aII good.

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,312
There are two things
that everybody needs to get with.

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,753
First, hiIIbiIIy,
you have got to Iearn some respect.

80
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,469
The man here made everything possibIe.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,356
And you, you're gonna have to get with
that we are doing this thing this afternoon

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,273
as soon as we get on PI.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,796
So you're just gonna make a run for it
in the middIe of the day.

84
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,509
WeII, you gotta do
what you gotta do, huh, baby?

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,512
- You are gonna screw this whoIe thing up.
- (laughs)

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,990
That's not for you to decide any more.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,232
Now, this train is Ieaving the station,
and I suggest you get on it.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,151
Get on the train, fish.

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,992
Get on the train.

90
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,074
WeII, you know what, you sons of bitches?
I won't Iet you do it.

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,472
What you gonna do?
BIow the whistIe on your own escape?

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,070
He'II be back.

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,829
Those guys, they go before us tonight,
they use that hoIe, it's over.

94
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,515
COs wiII turn this whoIe pIace upside down
tiII they find it.

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,036
WeII, sounds Iike you're thinking about it.

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,119
I'd be Iying if I said I wasn't.

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,989
I want to be out of here yesterday.

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,719
I got a kid coming, man.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,476
MichaeI, you can't get him out of there.

100
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,589
Can I say something?
I know you won't want to hear it, but...

101
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,240
they're strapping him up either way now.

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,756
Once he's gone,
you'II be stuck here for another five years.

103
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,116
If they trace the hoIe back to you,
they'II toss another dime.

104
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,794
That's 15 years, papi.

105
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,834
Of course, if I were you,
I wouIdn't Ieave my brother behind either.

106
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,036
Not to die Iike that, no.

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,429
Uh-uh.

108
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,311
Worst thing in the worId they can do to a man
is strap him to a chair Iike that.

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,512
- We're in business.
- What?

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,799
I just spoke to a friend who's a cIerk at the
superior court. I toId him about the informant.

111
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,475
If he gives any evidence to warrant a stay,
my friend wiII hear us out.

112
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,438
- We might be abIe to stop this.
- I gotta teII LincoIn.

113
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,875
Go to that prison, they'II be aII over you.

114
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,080
They've kept us on the run because if anyone
hears from us, we can do them damage.

115
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,789
Maybe it's time
we do the exact opposite - go big.

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,872
What do you mean, ''big''?
You mean media big?

117
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,791
We got aII the ammo we need.

118
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,917
There's a string of murders connected to this.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,231
Are you ready to show your face again? Huh?

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,038
Are you ready for that?

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,874
It's the bottom of the ninth.
What eIse are we gonna do?

122
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,390
(girl) Hello?

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,190
- Hey. This is Daddy, baby girI.
- Daddy!

124
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,840
Daddy's on the phone.

125
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,438
- How are the cameIs?
- Oh, weII, the cameIs... the cameIs are fine.

126
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,593
- When do l get to see you?
- EarIier than I thought.

127
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,989
Daddy said he's coming home soon.

128
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,990
Hey, put Mommy on the phone.

129
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,548
Thank you, sweetie.

130
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,712
First Sergeant Benjamin MiIes FrankIin,
how are you?

131
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,591
Oh, baby. Just driving trucks, eating dates,
trying to keep the sand out of my eyes.

132
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
I saw on the news the other day
it was 110 in Kuwait.

133
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,995
- You must be meIting over there.
- You have no idea.

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,437
What's this about you coming home?
You're not getting your daughter's hopes up?

135
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,035
- You sitting down?
- Sure.

136
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,190
Your man is coming home this week.

137
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,955
This week? What are you taIking about?
They said it'd be another year.

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,395
The orders just came down the pipe.

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,153
And the heII if I care
where they came down from.

140
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,518
- All that matters is we'll see each other.
- When? When is this happening?

141
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,717
Thursday, Friday. I'm not sure yet.

142
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,268
Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,271
Oh, no. No, no.

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,956
The army's got that aII arranged.
You know, you just be waiting for me.

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,918
WeII, you know I got that down.

146
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,395
(man) Today, C-Note.

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,074
WouId you back up?

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,714
Hey, you know, comm is onIy Ietting me
use this Iinkup for a few more minutes.

149
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,193
- Is Darius there? I need to speak to him.
- Yeah, yeah. I'II go get him.

150
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,350
I Iove you.

151
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,874
I Iove you more.

152
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,710
(man) Yo.

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,268
Yeah, what's up, money?

154
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,635
Your sister out of the room?

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,352
She is now.

156
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,718
So, how is it out there, man?
Fox River aII that they say it is?

157
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,156
Oh, man, it ain't aII that. Not for Iong, anyway.

158
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,391
- What you mean by that?
- I need you to do something for me.

159
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,550
Yeah, aII right.

160
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,950
- You stiII drive that EscaIade?
- Is MichaeI Jackson stiII white?

161
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,270
Ha-ha, you gotjokes, son.

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,794
How many does it hoId?

163
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,757
OK.

164
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,874
OK what?

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,916
Let's do it.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,195
What? You mean tonight?

167
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,919
What about Linc?

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,275
I need a razor bIade.

169
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,990
- A razor bIade ain't gonna get him out.
- Do you have one or not?

170
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,119
CarefuI, bro.

171
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,509
Ay, Cristo amado.

172
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,872
Thou shaIt not kiII!

173
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,957
Thou shaIt not kiII!

174
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,037
..Ieadeth me beside the stiII waters,
restoreth my souI.

175
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,759
Leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for your sake.

176
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,277
Though I waIk through the vaIIey
of the shadow of death, I wiII fear no eviI,

177
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,828
for thou art with me.

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,675
Thou preparest a tabIe before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,116
SureIy goodness and mercy shaII foIIow me

180
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,998
aII the days of my Iife,

181
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,756
and I wiII dweII
in the house of the Lord forever.

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,196
- Amen.
- Amen.

183
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,070
- He does hear our prayers, the Lord...
- Yes.

184
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,835
..on behaIf of LincoIn.

185
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,835
- AII who seek forgiveness wiII be deIivered.
- Yes.

186
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,311
If your brother accepts the Lord,
he'II be free of this cage forever.

187
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,516
Yes.

188
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,552
I'II be avaiIabIe
through this whoIe thing if you need me.

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,437
Reverend.

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,990
Reverend, wouId you give this to my brother?

191
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,038
It'd mean a Iot to him,
knowing it came from me.

192
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,591
I wiII.

193
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,758
That was my mother's.

194
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,435
TeII her it's going
to save someone a Iot of pain.

195
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,517
You sure you know what you're doing?

196
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,632
It's in God's hands now.

197
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,309
You've been the cIean-up crew for me
the whoIe time I've been in here.

198
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,915
Toes, contusions, insuIin shots.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,036
WeII, somebody's gotta do it.

200
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,588
WeII, I'm gratefuI.

201
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,116
You ever think, in another Iife...

202
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,149
- I won't be that woman, MichaeI.
- I wasn't asking you to be.

203
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
But it is something to wonder about.

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,034
What if?

205
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,998
Anyway, just wanted to make sure it was said.

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,237
Why do I feeI
Iike you're saying goodbye to me?

207
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,390
I don't know.

208
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,918
I guess in a pIace Iike this, you never know
which day is gonna be your Iast.

209
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,069
(door opens)

210
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,470
- Sara, we got a backup out here.
- OK.

211
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,915
You're set.

212
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,797
I...

213
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,675
I'm sorry about your brother.

214
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,957
Doctor...

215
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,231
Thank you.

216
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,354
This is it, bro.

217
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,835
Hey.

218
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,028
Good Iuck to both of us.

219
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,634
PI! Let's do it!

220
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,118
Came to your senses, did you?

221
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,991
You figure a magic way to get your brother
out of that hoIe and into the guards' room?

222
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,674
He's not gonna be there.

223
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,993
CouId you put the Iight on?

224
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,313
You OK?

225
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,759
What do you think, Rev?

226
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,150
I spoke with your brother today.
He's been praying for you.

227
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,708
He must be desperate.

228
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,395
What about you? Are you feeIing desperate?

229
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,152
No.

230
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,515
Just for everyone eIse.

231
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,478
The ones you Ieave behind.

232
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,916
The ones I never got to say goodbye to.

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,639
I can be with you
aII day tomorrow, you know.

234
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,757
Right up to the time.

235
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,035
Thank you.

236
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,799
He wanted me to give this to you.

237
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,677
MichaeI.

238
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,796
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

239
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,117
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

240
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,392
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

241
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,751
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

242
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,236
Thou shaIt not kiII!
Thou shaIt not kiII!

243
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,834
Thou shaIt not kiII!

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,117
- She's back in pIay.
- Good. Who's there with you?

245
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,438
- Tangren.
- What about HaIe?

246
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,511
Nope. MIA.

247
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,795
He shouId be there. What do you mean, MIA?

248
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,269
I think it's a fairIy concise term.

249
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,671
(dials number)

250
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,393
(phone rings)

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,119
Don't get it.

252
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,278
- What time's the fIight?
- 11. I gotta head up to WrigIeyviIIe.

253
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,148
I'II be back in a coupIe hours to coIIect you.
Pack everything.

254
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,674
Once we're out that door,
we won't come back.

255
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,436
- What are you gonna do?
- There's a Ietter I gotta deIiver.

256
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,909
(crowd) Thou shaIt not kiII!

257
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,353
You'II have to step away.

258
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,352
I'm Veronica Donovan.
I represent LincoIn Burrows.

259
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,477
- (woman) This isn't the time.
- You'II have to step aside.

260
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,757
I'm sorry, did you say
that you represent LincoIn Burrows?

261
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,799
- That's right.
- AngeIa West. I'm a producer with News Six.

262
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,997
So, Mr Pied Piper, what's the pIay?

263
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,037
We do what we aIways do -
pretend to be working, be modeI citizens,

264
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,951
tiII the time comes.

265
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,679
- And that'd be?
- Nine o'cIock.

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,275
You seem to be forgetting
that PI shuts down at five o'cIock.

267
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,955
WeII, we have to make sure
it doesn't, don't we?

268
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,430
Hammer.

269
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,354
Whoa! What the heII are you doing, man?

270
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,951
(water dripping)

271
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,675
- What the heII happened here?
- Messed up. Hit a pipe.

272
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,150
- ShouId've kiIIed the water before we started.
- ShouId've?

273
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,596
It's not that big a deaI.
We can fix it in the morning.

274
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,513
I don't think mouId
shouId be a probIem before then.

275
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,397
- MouId?
- ScofieId, shut up, man.

276
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,516
You shut up. What are you taIking about?

277
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,432
You get drywaII and insuIation soaked Iike
this, you run the risk of stachybotrys mouId.

278
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,799
Boss, that's just, Iike,
one time in a thousand, for reaI.

279
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,757
TeII you what.

280
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,355
You and aII your compa��eros here
aren't stepping outside this door

281
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,750
untiI every damn moIecuIe of water
is out of this pIace.

282
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,119
- It's gonna take aII night.
- WeII, then it's gonna take aII night.

283
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,509
Don't catch a sniffIe.

284
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,748
Man.

285
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,919
(crowd) Free Burrows!
Free Burrows! Free Burrows!

286
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,834
- Great. A Iot of it checks out.
- (man) Put her on.

287
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,674
- If you don't mind, we'd Iike to put you on.
- That's why I'm here.

288
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,756
Great. HoIIy here wiII be asking the questions.
Just watch his hand, OK?

289
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,199
Peter, I'm with Veronica Donovan,
the Iawyer for LincoIn Burrows.

290
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,238
- You're petitioning for a stay, is that right?
- Yes.

291
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,995
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that my cIient was framed.

292
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,479
Get specifics.

293
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,075
- Do you have any proof?
- There's a whoIe string of proof.

294
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,436
Murders - Leticia Barris,
a potentiaI excuIpatory witness,

295
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,590
Lisa Rix, the mother of LincoIn's chiId,

296
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,752
Bishop McMorrow,
who couId have petitioned for cIemency.

297
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,956
Someone's kiIIing these peopIe off?

298
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,114
Somebody's trying to hide what happened,
the truth about Terrence Steadman.

299
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,352
Is this specuIation, or is there
hard evidence to substantiate your cIaims?

300
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,795
- (Veronica) l have a source.
- Get a name.

301
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,598
- CouId you eIaborate?
- No.

302
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,672
Somebody on the inside
claims they can exonerate Lincoln,

303
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,558
that Terrence Steadman
wasn't in the car that night.

304
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,029
Someone's been taIking.

305
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,750
- Is there a reason you're on direct current?
- Sorry?

306
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,233
You know, AC/DC.
AIternating current, direct current.

307
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,154
DC's kinda yesterday's news
for this sort of thing.

308
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,313
You can kiII a man
with haIf the energy if you go AC.

309
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,072
OK. Let's see what we got.

310
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,514
You ready to run one?

311
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,235
(electricity crackles)

312
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,994
I think you better turn these Iights on.

313
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,640
Can't do it. Your cIient's being discipIined.

314
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,870
You're vioIating
his Eighth Amendment rights.

315
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,671
Either you turn those Iights on, or you'II
be the first defendant named in a Iawsuit.

316
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,031
You OK?

317
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,713
- LJ?
- He's good.

318
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,549
He's scared, but he's good.

319
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,353
- I found someone who's gonna taIk.
- Who?

320
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't know,
but I'II meet him in a few hours.

321
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,358
- A few hours is cutting it cIose, V.
- We don't have any other choice.

322
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,749
You have to have faith, OK?

323
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,037
Nick's aIready primed the court
to hear our case.

324
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,672
Whatever MichaeI's doing,
he doesn't need to do it now.

325
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,672
- We'II beat this the right way.
- What if you're wrong?

326
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,479
- I'm not.
- What if you are?

327
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,996
You gotta trust me, OK?

328
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,833
Don't give up on me.

329
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,556
Promise?

330
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,396
- Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's aII right. PauI, how are you?

331
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,914
I'm good, I'm good.

332
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,436
- You?
- Oh. (laughs)

333
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,870
- Where you going?
- Vacation.

334
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
Bahamas.

335
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,513
- Packing kinda heaviIy for the Bahamas.
- You know women.

336
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,716
Yeah.

337
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,679
So, where's Danny?

338
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,673
- Running errands, I think.
- Errands, huh?

339
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,069
Where... where might those errands be?

340
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,309
- Lewis, you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, Linc.

341
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,994
What time you got?

342
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,677
A IittIe after eight.

343
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,831
It's 8:15.

344
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,871
You OK?

345
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,595
No.

346
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,790
(groans)

347
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,599
(vomits)

348
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,832
(groans)

349
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,913
(groaning) Oh, MichaeI,
what have you done to me?

350
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,991
(cries out)

351
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,996
Nine o'cIock, fish.

352
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,071
Showtime.

353
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,753
Let's go, man.

354
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,311
(Lincoln groans)

355
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,751
Tancredi Ieave yet?

356
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,910
I don't think so.

357
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,389
You better caII her.

358
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,034
See you on the other side.

359
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,512
WeII, everything teIIs me it's food poisoning,

360
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,637
which means you shouId
feeI better in a coupIe of hours,

361
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,517
but...

362
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,910
I wish I couId say that this wouId be enough
to forestaII the execution. It's not gonna be.

363
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,389
It's aII right.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,517
I can stay with you if you want.

365
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,790
No.

366
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,952
It's fine. Thank you.

367
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,951
OK.

368
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,278
We got a Iot to taIk about
and not a Iot of time to do it.

369
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,353
Your boyfriend, he can stiII be saved.

370
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,080
Burrows was chosen a Iong time ago.
Hand-picked to be an assassin.

371
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,469
But he never puIIed the trigger.

372
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,075
Who did? Come on.

373
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,550
Who kiIIed Terrence Steadman?

374
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,279
- Nobody.
- What?

375
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,635
Terrence Steadman's stiII aIive.

376
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,914
There's three sheets of paper inside.

377
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,434
You'II find aII the names
you need are on them.

378
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,514
Everyone that started this whoIe thing,
from top to bottom.

379
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,598
You need to take two steps that way,
right now.

380
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,357
Behind the car. Get behind the car.
You want to stay aIive, do as I say. Now.

381
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,079
Your boys better be there, rughead.

382
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,197
They'II be there, cIeatis. Don't you worry.

383
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,670
This is crazy.

384
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,910
So, what are you doing here, Danny?

385
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,716
- Where's the Iawyer?
- I don't know what you're taIking about.

386
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,950
AIIison toId me.

387
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,871

of PauI KeIIerman, or DanieI HaIe.

In addition, there were no other witnesses
to this shooting.

No buIIets were found, no bIood,
no sheII casings.

just by biting on it?

-l had a dream last night,

You and me were working on a house,
pounding nails,

456
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,589
And in the dream,

457
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,190
it feIt Iike we were oIder.

wasn"t going to be the end,

468
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,164
I just wanted to make sure that
you were fuIIy aware of the circumstances.

I'm fuIIy acquainted
with the Burrows case, Sara,

with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon.

And I understand
that most of this evidence

473
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,245
is technicaIIy considered circumstantiaI,
but I think you'II agree it's hard to ignore.

say that they are innocent?

00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,559
Eighty, ninety percent?

87
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,619
That's impossibIe. Let me see this.

88
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,092
I want the conviction overturned

89
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,289
and LincoIn Burrows
immediateIy reIeased from custody.

90
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
These records haven't even been certified.

91
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,530
The hospitaI can teII you.

92
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,128
The hospitaI does not keep records
going back that far. I checked.

93
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,332
So as far as we know,

94
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,842
these documents couId be a hoax
from some anti-death penaIty advocate

95
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,970
or, dare I say it, defense counseI.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,707
Oh, pIease. You're preposterous.

97
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,079
Let's just aII
take a deep breath here, okay?

98
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,708
I don't know what these papers mean

99
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,344
and for that reason,
I'd Iike to err on the side of caution.

100
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,481
I'm going to deIay the execution
for two weeks.

101
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,187
That shouId give us more than enough
time to exhume the body.

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,891
Exhume the body.

103
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,956
Your Honor, aII due respect,
that is a drastic measure.

104
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,093
It's aIso the onIy way we're going to know

105
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,933
if that body in the ground
is reaIIy Terrence Steadman.

Steadman that was buried?

109

110
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,583

lf it is, we"re right back where we started,

112
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,754
Take care of yourself, Michael,

113
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,022
So, that body, what if it's him?

114
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,291
WeII, I'm not going to sit around hoping.

115
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,134
What does that mean?

116
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,103
It means we get back to work.

117
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,435
God, I was hoping you wouId say that.

118
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,167
They're digging up the body, huh?

119
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,472
To be honest, I've never been
in a situation Iike this before.

120

to extreme Iengths to get you out of here.

123

Warden,

124
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,033
at the execution,
there was a man in the viewing room.

125
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,335
Just wondering if you or anyone
in the prison had spoken to him.

126
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,365
WeII, according to this,

127
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,408
those present were your brother,
his attorney and three reporters,

128
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,440
two women and a man.

129
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,484

130
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,184

-You don't know those pIans by now?
-No.

139

140
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,423
Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?

-You saying you found another way?
-Maybe.

We're stiII going out through the infirmary

151
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,005
and we're stiII going to do it
from the guards' room.

It's just the in-between
that's gonna have to change.

Now wait a minute.
Why are you changing the pIan, man?

154
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
We're aIready through that room
beneath the infirmary.

155
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,280
That's aII we gotta do is get through
that pipe and we're home free.

156
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,179
There's a reason they repIaced it
with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

It's the onIy buiIding that shares
a subsurface Iine with the infirmary.

to get to the infirmary
we gotta go through the whack shack?

UnIess you got a better idea.

165
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,596
And there's a subsurface Iine

166
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,470
that runs from the guards' room
to the psych ward?

167
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,803
Sort of.

What do you mean ''sort of''?

169
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,237
We can go into that hoIe

About 40 yards up Route 66, there's

With aII that went down yesterday,

295
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,767

to see something that wasn't there?

296

have been through what you just did.

305
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,565
So if you thought you saw someone,

306
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,131
it's possibIe that it was your subconscious
giving you what you wanted,

307

308
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,179
you wanted to be there with you
in that moment to comfort you.

-How compIex can it be?
-Very.

350
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,787
When they buiIt this pIace in 1858,
the pipes were Iead.

351
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,828
A century Iater,
they discovered Iead was a heaIth risk

352
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,922
so they went to copper.
They never removed the Iead pipes.

353
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,864
Cost too much.

354
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,436
There's thousands of yards
of the stuff stiII down there.

355
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,199
And then a few years ago,
they switched to industriaI pIastic.

356
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,333
Again, it was cheaper
just to Iay it over the oId stuff.

I won't make it back by count.

The pIaster adds a Iot of weight.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,748
I may have to add reinforcements.

Whatever it takes, as Iong as you get done
in time for the anniversary.

18

It'II be done. HoId this.

You know, the Shah Ioved his Taj so much

20
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,564
that he buiIt another tempIe
just Iike it on the other side of the river.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,134
It was an absoIute mirror image.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,102
Except it was darker,
it was Iike a bIack Taj MahaI.

23
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,967
Never heard of it.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,065
WeII, that's 'cause it was never compIeted.

before he couId finish it.

00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,875
-Sounds Iike a myth.
-No, it's 100��/�� true.

-Doctor, what can I do for you?
-ActuaIIy, it's about ScofieId, sir.

32
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,467
Come in.

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,947
-What about ScofieId?
-The burn on his back is fairIy serious.

34
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,181
He seems to be recovering.

35
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,678
At first, I assumed
he was being assauIted by another inmate,

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,758
but I found this embedded
in the skin on his back.

37
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,521
-What's this?
-It's fabric.

38
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,293
Came from a guard's uniform.

-Any Iuck?
-No.

45
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,963
I spent a Iot of time
studying those bIueprints,

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,766
tracing them night after night,

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,366

-How do they get Iike that, I got no idea.
-I do.

-She tug on your pocket?

So how about it, Fish?
When we roIIing out?

55
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,137
-One hiccup Ieft, but I'm working on it.
-Yeah, and what is that?

56
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,978
Our road map's
a IittIe incompIete at the moment.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,014
I don't get it.
Why not just go down there again?

58
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,386
'Cause, one, I don't have
the guard's uniform anymore,

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,187
which means I can't get across the yard
or past the orderIy.

60
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,593

it's a mess down there.

-Not with you hounding me.

A IittIe more.

181
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,841
Okay, I got it.

182
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,962
You okay?

183
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,154
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,660

185
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,339
WouId you give us a minute, Gary?

186
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,184
MichaeI, I want you to be
absoIuteIy honest with me.

187
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,518
Dr. Tancredi found this

188
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,653
embedded in your fIesh
when she was treating you.

189
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,562
ApparentIy, it came
from a guard's uniform.

190
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,260
Have you been assauIted by an officer?

191
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,906
MichaeI, MichaeI,

192
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,408
I need an answer.

193
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,206
This is not about
sticking to the inmates' code anymore.

194
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,042
This is about officer misconduct.
That's my responsibiIity.

195
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,208
You wouIdn't want to see me
Iose my job now, wouId you?

196
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,344
No, of course not. You have been
very good to me and my brother.

197
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,891
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

198
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,520
Otherwise, your ass is going to soIitary.
You understand?

199
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,689
It's your choice.

200
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,597
Don't... Hey, pIease, Iisten to me.

201
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,429
-CooI down!
-Listen to me, don't do this!

202
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,007
Don't do this!

203
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,138
MichaeI!

204
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,235
No!

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,421

206

-Linc?
-What the heII are you doing in here?

209
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,180
Linc, we're in a Iot of troubIe now.

210

211
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,912

212

213

214
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,551
He's got proof that I was
where I wasn't supposed to be.

215
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,932
He doesn't know it, but sooner or Iater
he's going to put the whoIe thing together.

216
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,694
There's no way out of this.

217
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,269
Yeah, there is.

-You just got to keep the faith.
-No.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,871
I put my bIood into this,
and it's coming apart.

220
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,203

221
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,836
The whoIe point of soIitary is to break you,

222
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,378

223
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,315

224
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,447
Don't Iet them break you.

226
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,529
Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took me so Iong
to get back to you.

227
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,393
Turns out that our division is not
getting mobiIized for a coupIe more days.

228
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,165
When I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know what to think, baby.

229
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,039
I got so worried. I started
watching the news, Iooking for casuaIties.

230
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm so sorry about aII this.
You gotta beIieve that.

231
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,112
I started caIIing
the rear detachment office,

232
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,311
asking if there was some sort of probIem
with the 1 17th.

233
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:25,991
No.

234
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,082
There"s not a problem with the 1 1 7th,

235
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,320
We"re coming back, lt"s a snafu, that"s all,

236
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,364
A couple more days,
and we"ll be on those hops, baby,

237
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,461
That's not what
the rear detachment officer said.

238
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,095
He said the 1 1 7th wasn"t coming home
for another six months,

239
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,107
What? No. That can't be right.

240
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,676
That's what he said.

241
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,203
You know what it is?

242
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,209
It's because we're transpo.

00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,376
You know, technicaIIy
we're on a Ioan-out from the 140th.

244
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,453
I mean, that's why he said that.

245
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,216
-The 140th?
-Yeah, yeah.

246
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,389
It's just a few more days.

00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,960

-Are you kidding? That's impossibIe.

I can get into the guards' room.

If he Iives,

329
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,729
you're the one that stands to Iose,
not the Company.

330
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,569
They get themseIves another candidate,

331
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,905
and you're the one
that suffers the brunt of it.

332
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,002
Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.

333
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,342
We do that,
they puII support for the campaign.

334
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,611
You know that, don't you?

335
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,018
That is, if they know, PauI.

336
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,119
(SNIFFING) SmeII that kitty.

337
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,124
Jacks or better, Trips to win.

338
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,969
Last hand.

339
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,069
I'm tired of Iosing aII my money today.

340
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,310
-How much you up?
-I don't know. $300.

341
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,882
-Does it hurt?
-What?

342
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,679
The horseshoe up your ass.

343
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,379
Rather be Iucky than good, ping-pong.

344
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,258
MisdeaI. Bury the card.

345
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,159
-Man, I don't care if you aII saw my card.
-Yeah, I bet you don't.

346
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,834
-Bury the card, young bIood.
-Hey, chiII, wrinkIes.

347
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,471
Ain't my fauIt saItine here
got a sIoppy deaI.

348
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,270
That there was just uncaIIed for.

349
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,072
Now, aII right. You know what?
I'II teII you what.

350
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,579
I'm gonna deaI another hand,
you gonna be such a baby about it.

351
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,886
On a misdeaI, you bury the card,
finish out the hand.

352
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,422
House ruIes.

353
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,351
-Warden.
-I have some good news for you, Linc.

354
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,931
Somehow, your Iawyer's
petition went through.

355
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,367
The Department of Corrections
is aIIowing you a one-hour visit

356
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,959
with your son.

357
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,303
I've never seen
one of these granted before, ever.

358
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,379
-Good Iawyers.
-No Iawyer's that good.

359
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,875
I'II make the traveI arrangements,

360
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,610
but this is not going to be
a ride in the country.

361
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,084
You're gonna be y-cuffed,
and the men are gonna be heaviIy armed.

362
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,521
-I don't want any probIems.
-There won't be, I just want to see my son.

363
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,938
I'II bet aII I got.

364
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,372
$82.

365
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,086
You better have some aces
shoved up there with that horseshoe,

366
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,916
or that pot's mine.

367
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,250
You in or out?

368
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,117
I'm in.

369
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,424
And I raise you $74.

370
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,359
-I said I onIy got $82 Ieft.
-WeII, then I guess you're out of Iuck.

371
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,565
-You never heard of a gentIeman's game?
-Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

372
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,699
You want to borrow some money?
Ask your boys.

373
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,801
But I'm in here to make money, bro.

374
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,041
You want weIfare,
you'd better vote Democrat.

375
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:57,430
If you know what's good for you,
you'II stay away from me in the yard.

(SIGHING)

377
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,450
You think you're smarter than me?

379
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,805
No, no, no!

380
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,711
Okay, there's a pathway.
No, there's a pathway! There's a pathway!

381
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,841
Look, he's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape. This is his map!

382
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,579
-Haywire, I need you to come back!
-He set me up!

383
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,951
-Zap him !
-No! No!

384
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,470
There he is.

385
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,237
Hey, boss.
I think you dropped something, man.

386
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,808
That's haIf a G-note.

387
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,944
-So when do I move in?
-You don't.

388
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,112
What?

389
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,423
-Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deaI.
-Renegotiation, the price is $700 now.

390
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,160
That ain't right. I just gave you $500.

391
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:37,598
What you gave me was a down payment.
If you can't come up with the rest, weII...

392
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,136
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Just hoId on.

393
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,103
One minute, aII right?

394
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,077
Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down.

395
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,647
-I'm gonna need that watch.
-Not an option.

396
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,514
Look, wouId you rather be
Iooking at a picture of your daughter

397
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,782
or hoIding her in your arms
once you get outside?

398
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,704
Hey, Iook, man,
Father Time owed me a few bones.

399
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,714
He gave me this in trade.

400
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,444
That shouId be
more than enough to cover it.

401
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,814
Not bad.

402
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,053
Your probIem is somebody
aIready gave me $700 for the ceII,

403

No! No! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa !

Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Look.

406
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,190
So you're just gonna
take my money and waIk?

-Yeah, yeah.

00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,462
Thanks.

416
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,702
I made you something.

417
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,839
It's an ashtray.

00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,045
-I don't smoke.
-Yeah, I know.

But they onIy
Iet us make these and jeweIry,

420
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,116
and I didn't figure you
for the macaroni neckIace type.

421
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,850
It's very sweet.

422
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,590
How about we taIk
about how you're doing?

423
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,730
I think we both know I don't beIong here.

424
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:55,033
I don't remember much about that night,
but being Iocked up in ad seg,

425
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,164
something must've snapped.

426
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,576
What I'm trying to say is,
I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.

427
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,980
But that's your caII.

428
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,746
And the doctors here
do say that you've been acting fine.

429
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,219
The probIem is that
if you don't teII the Pope who burned you,

430
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,586
he's gonna Iock you back up in ad seg.

431
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,650
And after a coupIe days of that,
you're gonna be right back here.

432
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,492
MichaeI, I hate what happened to you,
and I hate that you're here.

But you have got to Iet me heIp you.

434

If you want to get out of psych ward,
and stay out,

435
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,747
you've got to teII the Pope
the truth about that burn.

436
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,080
Out with the oId, in with the new, cons.

437
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,364
I got a message from your ceIIie, bro.

438
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,559
He says he's okay
and he's trying to fiII in the bIanks.

439
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,865
Did he say he's trying,
or that he aIready got the bIanks fiIIed in?

440
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,133
Yo, man, I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

441
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,267
Okay. Now you gotta teII him
that I fiIIed in the hoIe.

442
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm done
with your IittIe secrets and messages, bro.

443
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,945
I saw ScofieId's back.

444
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,417
He's got a burn in the same spot
as the burn in that guard's shirt.

but I have an idea, huh?

untiI you teII me what's going on.

I can't, bro.

00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,555
I think we can work something out.

Geary wiII pay. BeIieve that.

with your ScofieId probIem.

-What'd you say, sIim?
-I said I got a way to heIp you with...

-Who the heII said we had a probIem?
-It's cooI, man. ReIax.

What in the heII did they teII you?
ExactIy, what did they teII you?

462
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,475
Everything. They said I can come with you,
you know, on earIy paroIe,

Everyone gets to ride with us?

Why don't you take a waIk,
before I give you a smack?

466
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,567
You got another soIution to our situation?

467
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,034
I didn't think so.

Me and my cuz and LincoIn

469
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,845
came up with something.

470
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,613
Now, it can work, but it's risky.

471
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,272
You ready to get out of
this aquarium, Fish?

472
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,363

weII enough by now.

00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,776
Such assurances are not necessary.

476
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,173
With aII due respect, Warden,
if I had been protected in the first pIace,

477
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,648
none of this wouId have happened.

478
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,852
-A name.
-Geary.

479
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,157
Geary?

He shakes cons down for money,
anything he can get his hands on.

481
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,198
He knew I went to coIIege, so he must've...

482
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,501
He must've thought
I was rich or something.

483
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,839
Anyway, when I couIdn't pay up,

484
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,348
he heId me down with one arm,
and burned me with the other.

In this room, in this pIace.

00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,879
UntiI then, I can't.

136

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,421

00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,867

144
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,758
How many times I gotta say it?
You address me formaI-Iike.

145
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,560
-Mr. BaIIs-Johnson.
-That's better.

146
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,808
I think maybe you and I
can work something out.

147
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,776
-ReaIIy?
-Check it, I got this homie on the outside

148
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,405
and he can put a hundie into your
commissary account each month.

149
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,611
It was nice of you to think of me Iike that,

150
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,812
but you onIy got one thing I need.

151
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,682
I need you to get something for me.
Do your bump and swipe thing.

152
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,150
-Like I did with the watch?
-ExactIy.

153
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,121
Yeah, that did me a Iot of good.

154
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,727
Guards found out and they stuck me into
a ceII with Avocado.

Guards found out and they stuck me into
a ceII with Avocado.

156
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,057
So if you want something gIommed,

157
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,159
you need to do something for me.

This kid in my neighborhood,

163
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,631
his dad had a basebaII card coIIection.

164
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,526
So I figured, you know, I'd swipe it.

165
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,603
I couId get some party cash, you know?

166
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,345
And there was one card in there.

167
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,878
A 1910 Honus Wagner.

168
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,884
Doesn't mean nothing to me, you know.
Hoops is my sport.

169
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,757
This card, it was worth $300,000.

170
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,524
So they sIapped me with grand Iarceny.

171
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,871
That's why I'm here.

172
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,200
That's why I'm sitting on a nickeI
getting turned out Iike a IittIe bitch.

173
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,615

What are you doing here?

177
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,966
As soon as I heard they granted you
a visit with your son,

178
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,097
I knew they'd make a move on you.

179
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,176
I mean what are you doing here?

180
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,808
I've got a car about 20 miIes from here.

181

182

gonna make sure you disappear.

183
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,755
Then this business wiII just be
between me and them.

184
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,883
Can you move?

185
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,985
What are you taIking about?
They're after me, not you.

186
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,721
It's not as simpIe as that, trust me.

187
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,726

Why'd you Ieave?

191
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,447

to appoint, what wars to fight.

194

Thing is, if you wanted to rise in the ranks
Iike I did,

195
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,297
you had to commit to Ieaving
everything you know behind.

196
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,493
Because then you start to get access
to the reaI information.

Why didn't you caII us?

I don't know why you're in there,

but if there's one thing those guys
that brought me here taught me,

is that if you fight, if you struggIe,
you onIy make things worse.

-MichaeI has a deep need to heIp peopIe.

299
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,929
So I've come to understand.

300
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,465
That's actuaIIy how we met.

301
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,337
There were these men
that brought me here.

302
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,234
ToId me I'd have good job,
but that was just a Iie.

303
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,575
They were going to seII me.

304
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,209
And untiI they did, I...

305
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,979
MichaeI paid them off for my freedom.

306
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,115
And not to keep me for himseIf,
Iike I've heard from other girIs,

307
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,352
but to give me an opportunity.

308
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,762
He's a good man.

309
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,825
Yes, he is.

310
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,237
Nika, I wanna do
whatever I can to heIp MichaeI.

311
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,575
To do that, I need you to teII me
what it is you think he's mixed up in.

312
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,072
-I think this is a mistake.
-No, no, it's not at aII.

313
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,912
-If you can just teII me what it is...
-PIease, just keep an eye on him.

314
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,044
God, I'm sorry. Thanks.

315
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,316
Listen, couId I just have a contact number
for you in case I see something wrong.

316
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,619
I don't think that's a good idea.
PIease don't teII him that we met.

317
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,716
I... I...

318
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,494
Something I don't get.

319
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,871
How couId kiIIing me stop you?

320
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,806
'Cause I'm the one who Ieaked
the information about EcofieId.

321
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,541
They couId've covered up the scandaI
a thousand different ways,

322
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,414
but they chose to fake
Terrence Steadman's death.

323
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,857
And they chose you
'cause they knew it wouId fIush me out.

324
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,251
They knew that any man with a son
on death row who was innocent

325
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,392
wouId have to come forward.

326
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,661
But you didn't.

327
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,659
We had a cause, Linc.

328
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,705
We have a cause.

329
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,135
Their wars can be averted

330
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,613
and miIIions of Iives can be saved.

331
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,478
So you were wiIIing to sacrifice one.

332
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,777
Yeah.

333
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,056
At Ieast I thought.

334
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,660
But I couIdn't watch you die.

335
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,826
You know what you've done?

336
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,036
The mother of my chiId is dead.

337
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,568
-I know.
-Do you?

338
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,233
Then I'm guessing you know
MichaeI's in Fox River

339
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,437
-and LJ's rotting in some jaiI.
-I know aII of it.

340
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,074
-If you think for a second...
-You don't have a choice right now.

341
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,548
This is aII on you. AII of it.

342
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

343
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,761
'Cause there's stiII a chance
we can make it right.

344
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,055
That man in there
is our transportation out of here,

345
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,464
which means that, you go after him,

346
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,462
and that messes with my chances
of me seeing my famiIy.

347
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,630
So I ain't gonna Iet that happen.

348
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,942
So why don't you just hand me
that shank you're hoIding, huh?

349
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,175
Good.

350
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,365
-Hey, Sara.
-Hey, Rick.

351
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,033
You aII right?

352
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,804
Yeah. I can't find my keys.
WouId you Iet me in?

353
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,967
Oh, sure.

354
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,446
-I'm surprised to see you here.
-That makes both of us.

355
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,380
Look.

356
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,955
You were right and I'm sorry.

357
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,361
I shouId never have gotten you
invoIved in this.

358
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,398
-Oh, it's okay.
-No, it's not.

359
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,767
If anyone knew what I asked...

360
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,308
I'm not even sure why I did it.

361
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,502
Thank you.

362
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,610
Now we're even.

363
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,682
-You didn't owe me anything.
-Yes, I did.

364
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,948
I owed you everything,
but that's over now.

365
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,818

Schimek up at the junkyard.

five, 10 minutes away, tops,

372
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,888
Good, I'm right behind you.

373
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,960

You know that, right?

375

There's an unimproved road
down by the river.

376
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,268
There's a chance
they haven't bIocked it off yet.

385
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,313

386
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,167
-AII right on your knees!
-Right there! Right there!

387

392
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,237

-How?
-Tweener.

394
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,308
But Avocado's saying
it got caught on the frame

395
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,938
whiIe he was hopping
down off his bunk, yeah.

396
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,478
Why did he Iie?

397
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,543
He doesn't want Tweener to go to
the SHU 'cause he can't get him in there.

398
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:55,057
AII I have to say is, as soon as
Avocado gets out of the infirmary,

399
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,683
Tweener is a dead man.

400

No, 'cause I had them this morning.

406

When did you first notice they were gone?

407
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,048

at that visitation Iog.

-Who?
-Fibonacci.

that I not onIy seek forgiveness,

414

WeII, I feeI very fortunate to have met you.

327
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,170
Yeah. I'm guessing
not many structuraI engineers

No, no, I don't mean
because of your vocation.

330
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,082
I mean because
you're a decent young man,

331

who make their way into Fox River.

Perhaps the biggest surprise

00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,873
is the inclusion of lllinois governor
Frank Tancredi,

380
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,671
His consideration
is attributed to his reputation

381
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,405
for being tough on crime,

382
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,916
